&lt;b&gt;The Rules Are Quite Simple. No
Trades Equals No Find. Logs with out a description of the trades
will be Deleted with out Mercy! Write a
creative Log, Trades should be some what even (TRADE-FAIR) so
perhaps you can leave multiple items in trade for ones of greater
value.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LIST OF TRADE GOODS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;*A reserved spot in the first pew of the Unarius Academy of
Science. www.unarius.org/start.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The engine block out of the 1963 Dodge Dart I found lying
around nearby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*A vintage 1967 Fender Stratocaster (previously owned by Jimi
Hendrix).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*The logs to my cache: &quot;Welcome to Tucson, a Friendly Caching
Destination&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*left the spy space satelite that is falling toward earth. If
all goes well it should hit 3 feet from the cache!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*Express check-out for the Hotel Calfornia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*left a card, good for 10 years, to go to the front of the
check out line at Frys, for the months of June &amp; July&lt;/li&gt;

I wanted to pick up the 5daughters since their mother was missing them, but then I saw the  2007 Back hoe/Loader Tractor.14,000lbs, and I knew I'd have to dig a big hole to hide in when I returned to Tucson with out them!  So I left a 1966 M20E Mooney aircraft with a TBO engine, that has only been landed gear up once, and needs paint.

I also put the log back in the ziplock!  TFTC

&lt;b&gt;00110100001100110011000100110011&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take your Birth-Year (1900 or
what ever) and do the following.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rearrange the string of digits to form the
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;LARGEST&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;SMALLEST&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 4-digit
numbers possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take these two numbers and &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;subtract&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the smaller
from the larger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the number you obtain and repeat the above process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point you'll find that the number starts
repeating,&lt;b&gt;again and again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the number to use in the &lt;u&gt;following
calculations.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;THE FOLLOWING
CALCULATIONS&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PI Use (3.1416) No Rounding
Up or Down or Sideways&lt;br /&gt;
Not Sure----Don't Know----Ask----(It's
Free)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the number gleaned from the previous exercise, let this
number equal the circumference of a &lt;b&gt;Crop Circle in
feet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now &lt;b&gt;Inscribe&lt;/b&gt; a square in the &lt;b&gt;(C-C)&lt;/b&gt;, then find the
area of this &lt;b&gt;square&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;(square - feet)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between the
area of the &lt;b&gt;(C-C)&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;inscribe square??&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the difference and multiply by &lt;b&gt;15/32&lt;/b&gt; of a
dollar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now take the cube root of the cube root of the previous answer,
this will be the access number. &lt;b&gt;(Use The First Four
Digits)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When Closing The Lock Be Sure It's Snapped Closed
(LOCKED) (And-Covered)&lt;/b&gt;

being FTF!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A fairly well maintained road will get you there.&lt;br /&gt;
Then it's a short climb up the hill.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Space Data Corp. wants to bring wireless service to millions of
rural Americans. Their plan: Beam it down from balloons hovering at
the edge of space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The balloons are attached to a hydrogen tank and inflated to about
6 feet in diameter. Then the electronic payloads are hitched to the
balloon and let go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The balloons rise about 1,000 feet a minute and reach their target
altitude of 65,000 to 100,000 feet in under two hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a balloon approaches the end of its useful life, technicians
send a signal to separate it from its electronic payload, which
parachutes to earth. The balloons eventually burst into &quot;confetti&quot;
from the low air pressure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This isn't just hot air. Space Data Corp., already launches 10
balloons a day across the Southern U.S., providing specialized
telecom services to truckers and oil companies. The balloons soar
20 miles into the stratosphere, each carrying a shoebox size
payload of electronics that acts like a mini cellphone &quot;tower&quot;
covering thousands of square miles below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maintaining a telecom system based on gas-filled bladders floating
in the sky requires some creativity. The inexpensive balloons are
good for only 24 hours or so before ultimately bursting in the thin
air of the upper atmosphere. The electronic gear they carry,
encased in a small Styrofoam box, then drifts gently back to earth
on tiny parachutes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the balloons are cheap and disposable at $50 a pop, the
transceivers they carry are worth about $1,500. Once a transceiver
is released from its balloon to parachute back to earth, there's no
way to predict where it will land. So Space Data has hired 20
hobbyists with GPS devices to track them down...
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That's where we come in! After recovering a Balloon's Payload, a
cache will be hidden at the coordinates where the payload was
found. The payload we recovered from this location was from Space
Data Flight #17440&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">7,735-foot Sam’s Rock [previously unnamed] is an attention-getting mass of bare granite visible from Interstate 80 between Wells and Wendover, Nevada. If you’re eastbound at Pequop Pass (mile post 373), Sam’s Rock is the pinnacle you see on the far skyline as you head down from the summit. As you continue on past Oasis to the Shafter exit (m.p. 387), the view of the Rock from the south reveals two summits, the rounded one on the west being the higher by perhaps 20 feet. Driving westbound from Wendover, your view of the Rock is blocked by the southern masses of the Toano Range until you come to the Shafter exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to Sam’s Rock, take the Shafter exit and turn onto the frontage road that parallels the freeway on the north side. Immediately after the first cattle guard, turn left and follow the desert road north. High clearance is a good idea, but many passenger cars can make it if driven very carefully. At 3.1 miles, turn left onto the next road you come to; and in another 3/10 of a mile, bear to the right. Just over a mile farther, take the little-used but good road to the right and park at the top of the rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From where you park, you’ll see a wooded draw that goes up diagonally between the two summits. The draw is choked with trees and brush, so the easiest way is to make you way across the draw to the wall of the Rock itself, where you’ll find the going steep but relatively easy. Near the top you’ll suddenly come to the Crack, where the Rock is literally split in two. Except for a 6-foot ledge, it’s an easy scramble up the crack and suddenly you’re looking down the north face of the rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you scout the west wall of the Crack, you’ll see a couple of possible climbing routes; but the easiest route begins right at the north end of the Crack. Simply step across some tree branches to an overhung ledge and go up on your hands and knees. Soon you come out on top of the Crack and find that you’re separated from the summit block by a broken-up ridge that resembles the back of a Stegosaurus. It looks a bit chancy, but is fairly easy to work across. The summit block itself presents a 30-foot broken wall with one obvious route to begin with. Two-thirds of the way up, you can scout for a way over the top. At the far right (north) is a fairly easy route both up and down, though with exposure to the north wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summit itself is a wonderful place to experience; and the view is amazingly scenic—Pilot Peak (10,716 ft.) to the east, Bonneville Salt Flats to the southeast, and many long views and high ranges. At the high point (7,735 ft.) there’s a rock cairn. The cache is easy to find. It’s a 4-inch ABS pipe with a screw-on cap. After you’ve logged in, screw on the cap just snug; if you crank it down too tight, it will be hard for the next finder to open. Replace the cache with the screw-top downhill to help ensure that water from rain or snow doesn’t seep in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be warned that reaching the cache at the summit of Sam’s Rock is not a scramble and a quick grab. It’s about 700 vertical feet from where you park to the summit. The approximately 100 vertical feet from the Crack to the summit involves solid Class 4 rock climbing. In most places there are good holds on coarse granite, but it’s not for the faint-of-heart or anyone afraid of heights, and good physical condition is a must. Wear a helmet and boots suitable for climbing. Take your time and be safe! Don’t tackle it if it really is beyond your abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!  </groundspeak:long_description>

Difficulty rating is higher due to the remoteness of this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going &quot;in the hole&quot; is the railroader slang term for when a lower priority train has to wait in a siding for a higher priority train to pass. On May 28th 2011 we were stuck in Pequop siding waiting for another train to go by. I had time to go for a little walk and drop a geocache. FYI: If you are not a railroader: There is no need to get close to the railroad tracks to find this cache and if trains or maintainance workers are close please stay away from the tracks and trains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the terrain rating is due largely to the remoteness of this cache. please plan your trip accordingly.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">done numerous caching trips together, as have many others in the Magic Valley. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday when I went to see her in the hospital the first words out of her mouth were to ask how I was doing; not a word of complaint, no bemoaning her condition or what she was going through. Corky is a tower of strength for others to emulate when difficulities befall them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location of this cache is a spot I picked out last year to place a cache if ever I found a good enough reason to place one here. That reason has arrived sooner than I would have wished. This cache is a tribute to quietbreezes and the challenges she faces. And getting this cache will be a challenge to those who don’t like heights or rock climbing; and, yes, I fit in that group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a strictly MOJO cache. It is a small container that will hold a number of MOJOs. It will be easy to find once you get to the top. Just be very careful climbing up and back down, it would be a bad landing if you should slip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways you can log this cache. First, obviously, is to find the cache, sign the log and leave a MOJO if you have one. NO TRADES!!! Corky likes collecting people’s MOJOs, so if the distance is too great for you to travel or you have an unconquerable fear of heights, you can send your personal MOJO to me at: Dennis Frisby, 1424 Alpine Drive, Jerome, ID 83338 and log the cache as found. The whole purpose of this cache is to collect MOJOs to present to Corky in a ‘treasure chest’ as a tribute to her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the container is small, when it is apparent it is nearly full of MOJOs it would be great if someone would empty it and drop them off at the above given address. If that isn’t possible, be sure to note in your log that the container is almost full so I can empty it so more can be collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The family car can make most of the trip; at least to these coordinates: N43 08.564 W114 46.5811. Beyond that point if would be wiser to either hike or use a high-clearance vehicle. The hike took me approx. ½ hr; that included the climb up the rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, be safe, and pray for a quiet breeze to be blowing when you go after this one; it can get pretty hot out here in the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: The Gooding City of Rocks is a Wilderness Study Area. As such, it is requested if you find evidence that there is beginning to be too much traffic to any of the caches located there, i.e., human trails being formed, you contact the owner of the cache so it can either be moved to a new location or archived. Natural game trails and cattle trails are not to be considered as human impact trails.&lt;br/&gt;No off-roading with motorcycles, ATVs or other motorized vehicles. Practice CITO while hiking in this area so it can be enjoyed by all who come to this unique place.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When I got out of the car to go place this cache there was a calp of thunder in the distance, the wind was blowing pretty strong, and there were dark, ominous rolling clouds headed my way. But, I remembered Corky’s determination in solving puzzles and facing life in general and decided to push on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corky (Quietbreezes) was an amazing person in a number of ways. She had the compassion, understanding and patience of Aunt Bee on the Andy Griffth Show and the spunk, courage and loyalty of Miss Kitty on Gunsmoke; for those of you who can remember that far back. She suffered in silence without complaint and never looked for glory for her achievements. One of her greatest attributes was being a friend in a time when people are too busy to take the time to become friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corky seemed to thrive in the outdoors and cherished the times when others would take her along on caching trips. She enjoyed the beautiful new sights that geocaching took her to and if you paid attention you would see a smile on her face as she viewed a new vista.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed with the thought of how she would have reacted had she been able to make it to the cache site. It will be a challenge for the over 50 crowd and a smaller challenge for the under 40 crowd. It is probably as much of a climb as ETD: On Top of the World (GC12NB0), but longer. The view from the cache site is of Thorn Creek Ranch, the ponds and fields, all the way to Nevada on a clear day; a view I’m sure Corky would have wanted to sit and look at for every detail she could find. Unlike most of us, Corky was content to take in her surroundings at a cache site so she could relive them over and over, something she taught me to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache should be really easy to find. You only have to remove one rock, so don't tear the whole thing apart to find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a beaded medicine pouch for the FTF and 5 other smaller medicine pouches for trades. Please, no dollar store trades. I would normally fill these small medicine pouches with dried sage as the Native Americans did, but I’ll leave that to each of those who get one so they can appreciate the experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BTW, raindrops just started to splatter on the windshield as I started the car to leave; an answer to a silent prayer. Thanks for going along, Corky; you will be missed.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Conquer your phobias before they conquer you! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gephyrophobia is defined as a fear of crossing bridges. Patients often find that this fear is exacerbated by crossing bridges that are over bodies of water or, even worse, moving water! Sufferers of gephyrophobia may avoid routes that will take them over bridges. Dr. Liebowitz, founder of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute says: &quot;It's not an isolated phobia, but usually part of a larger constellation ... It's people who get panic attacks. You get light-headed, dizzy; your heart races. You become afraid that you'll feel trapped.&quot;. The New York Thruway Authority will lead gephyrophobiacs over the Tappan Zee Bridge. A driver can call the authority in advance and arrange for someone to drive the car over the bridge for them. The authority performs the service about six times a year.&lt;br/&gt; The Maryland Transportation Authority offers a similar service for crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The Silver Bridge,located in West Virginia that connected to Point Pleasant, collapsed in 1967 and killed 46 people which could be one of the triggers of gephyrophobia.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Though this is a fairly easy cache (for those who aren't gephyrophobiacs) I rated it at a 2 because you will likely encounter signal bouncing due to all of the water and metal nearby. Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Conquer your phobias before they conquer you! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Botanophobia is described as the fear of plants. To find this small cache you'll need to conquer this fear while also practicing supreme ninja stealth to avoid muggles. Best of luck!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Any normal person like you or I can fall victim to this kind of phobia. There are many things that cause Botanophobia. If you think that plants consume too much of oxygen and depletes your fair share, you might develop Botanophobia.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Similarly, if you experience allergic reactions or rashes a similar phobia might result. In addition to all these you might have personal negative associations with plants or harbor superstitious beliefs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Let me give you an example of superstitious belief that can lead to Botanophobia. Leaving flowers overnight with a patient is considered ominous. A flower or plant is supposed to invite evil spirits and allow them to cause harm to the patient.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Now, you might be wondering what problems a phobia of plants might cause. Sufferers of plant phobia experience higher stress levels. They also experience higher blood pressure, increased pulse rate and profuse sweating. They may even experience stomach pains, emotional vicissitudes and other physiological malfunctioning. In a broader perspective, the victim’s family life, employment and relationships tend to suffer.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Botanophobia can also be explained from a Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) viewpoint. NLP principle tells us that our unconscious minds are capable of forming mental constructs out of what we sense through our sensory organs. NLP practitioners term these mental constructs as mental codes. Any phobia is the outcome of a wrong set of mental codes associated with a specific object or person. In the case of phobia of plant, you might have experienced something unpleasant with plants in your childhood and have formed an unconscious association of unpleasantness with plants.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Now let us move on to available treatments for Botanophobia. There are a variety of drugs that psychiatrists prescribe to treat Botanophobia. Often these drugs have side effects. The effect of these drugs is restricted to temporary suppression of symptoms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;However, there is a reason to cheer! In-vivo desensitization (purposely exposing yourself to the feared object while effectively regulating your anxiety) has been found effective in curing Botanophobia. In 15 minutes, you might be in a position to conquer your Botanophobia and lead a more meaningful and trouble-free life!</groundspeak:long_description>

You found my Cache &quot;Can I Dig&quot; and asked where I got the camo for it. I hand made it from a magnet that I got from work. I have since lost that one in a large wind storm and have a new one that goes with the area more. if you want to talk more go to the cache on geocaching.com and send me a chat.</groundspeak:text>

Patients with Potamophobia often find a marked increase in anxiety as they get near moving bodies of water or, even worse, being on a moving body of water! Sufferers of Potamophobia may avoid driving along any routes that will take them near rivers and may constrict their social lives in such a way that they do not allow themselves to engage in any activities involving moving water.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed on an island on the Flathead River and is most easily accessed along the East end of West Reserve Drive. Access to this cache may require a raft, kayak or canoe. This should be a fairly easy cache for those who aren't potamophobiacs! Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>During later months when the river is low you can actually walk right out to the island!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was part of the series to solve the puzzle cache called &quot;Loose Lips&quot;. It is now just a normal cache with a log book and pencil and possibly a few small pieces of swag, but was once filled to the brim with 50 envelopes stuffed with vital clues to the puzzle! All 50 clue envelopes are now gone but I left the following description to show you what the hunt was all about!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attention Operatives!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been reported that a beacon was dropped here by the Other Side which contains information needed to solve the location of the final beacon at &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC3BGB9&quot;&gt;&quot;Loose Lips&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Please be careful that civilians or operatives from the Other Side do not see you at the location and be sure to rehide it as well as possible!&lt;br /&gt;
Enter your Hex Code (%54%61%6b%65%20%61%6e%20%65%6e%76%65%6c%6f%70%65) into the Information Database and retrieve one printout per Operative per visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following rules apply to the Information Database:&lt;br /&gt;
1. You may visit this beacon location once per week and take one printout per visit. However, you may only log it as “Found” once. The remaining visits may be logged as Notes.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Should you drop an unique Intellience Trackable Item such as a Travel Bug or Geocoin (one which has not been to the beacon before) in this beacon for another Operative to move along, you may take one additional printout from this Information Database.&lt;br /&gt;
3. You MUST log the following information onto the page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC3BGB9&quot;&gt;&quot;Loose Lips&quot;&lt;/a&gt; so other Operatives may benefit:&lt;br /&gt;
a) the printout number&lt;br /&gt;
b) each grid location and associated letter code of each grid location&lt;br /&gt;
(as a fictional example, Printout 125 G5 - O; J8 - B)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all 50 of the printouts have been removed from this beacon location, it will revert to a normal Traditional cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special note: The beacon appears to be a large almond jar so if you are highly allergic to almonds, I would stay away from this field mission and help solve the location of the Final Beacon from the safety of your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Operatives rustywa and kristaandgeoff for being the first boots on the ground at this beacon. Your bravery is what makes us strong.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was part of the series to solve the puzzle cache called &quot;Loose Lips&quot;. It is now just a normal cache with a log book and pencil and possibly a few small pieces of swag, but was once filled to the brim with 50 envelopes stuffed with vital clues to the puzzle! All 50 clue envelopes are now gone but I left the following description to show you what the hunt was all about!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attention Operatives!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been reported that a beacon was dropped here by the Other Side which contains information needed to solve the location of the final beacon at &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC3BGB9&quot;&gt;&quot;Loose Lips&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Please be careful that civilians or operatives from the Other Side do not see you at the location and be sure to rehide it as well as possible!&lt;br /&gt;
Enter your Hex Code (%54%61%6b%65%20%61%6e%20%65%6e%76%65%6c%6f%70%65) into the Information Database and retrieve one printout per Operative per visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following rules apply to the Information Database:&lt;br /&gt;
1. You may visit this beacon location once per week and take one printout per visit. However, you may only log it as “Found” once. The remaining visits may be logged as Notes.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Should you drop an unique Intellience Trackable Item such as a Travel Bug or Geocoin (one which has not been to the beacon before) in this beacon for another Operative to move along, you may take one additional printout from this Information Database.&lt;br /&gt;
3. You MUST log the following information onto the page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC3BGB9&quot;&gt;&quot;Loose Lips&quot;&lt;/a&gt; so other Operatives may benefit:&lt;br /&gt;
a) the printout number&lt;br /&gt;
b) each grid location and associated letter code of each grid location&lt;br /&gt;
(as a fictional example, Printout 125 G5 - O; J8 - B)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all 50 of the printouts have been removed from this beacon location, it will revert to a normal Traditional cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special note: The beacon appears to be a large almond jar so if you are highly allergic to almonds, I would stay away from this field mission and help solve the location of the Final Beacon from the safety of your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Operatives rustywa and kristaandgeoff for being the first to locate and activate the intelligence on this beacon. Remember, however, that your partner Geomonkey is designated 007, so too much taunting MAY set him off.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted
coordinates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father, our
family's unofficial genealogist, had kept a record of all of our
relatives in the basement of his house and was going to enter all
the pertinent information into a &lt;i&gt;digital&lt;/i&gt; database for safe
keeping of our family &lt;i&gt;roots&lt;/i&gt;. However, before that could
happen a spring flood occurred in the neighborhood and some water
made it's way into the basement. Dad crept down to check on his
records and found that most things had sustained no damage but one
box had sat in some water for a few days. Upon opening up the box,
most of the papers were intact and undamaged, but the bottom stack
of birth certificates had been made slightly damp, causing some
dates on the right hand side of those pages to become
illegible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being both a
genealogist by hobby and a mathematician by profession (oh, I
forgot to mention that?), he was aware of a few things. The first
was that off-spring are genetically the sum of their parents
genetic roots. With this kind of genetic study, if there are two
possibilities available, the son will always be the recessive (or
lower) of the two possibilities and the daughter will always be the
dominant (or higher) of the two possibilities. Also, the pages were
not necessarily sorted chronologically and sometimes couples have
children quite early in their lives and others quite
late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what he
found in that stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   Daughter: Karen F (Born March 17, 197X)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: Sophia F
(Born March 2, 1945)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certificate
#7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father: Daniel J
(Born October 31, 1973)          
  Daughter: Kaylee J (Born April 6, 200Y)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: Krista J
(Born January 14, 1975)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certificate
#8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father: Daniel J
(Born October 31, 1973)          
 Son: Prince J (Born September 23, 200Z)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: Krista J
(Born January 14, 1975)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is up to you to
find the correct number to fit into each missing date. From that,
you can calculate the location of our family tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N51
0A.BCD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W114
1W.XYZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you find that
tree, it should become apparent that my dad has much work to do on
our genealogy, as there are gaping holes in it still. At this place
you should find the coordinates to the final in a small, plastic
red and white mint container. However, it may take some strength,
ingenuity, use of the natural tools in the area, or a solid caching
partner to help you find these elusive numbers. Please replace the
mint container and cache carefully so that others may find them
too. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included a
geochecker so you can confirm your coordinates prior to heading
out. There should be a nice trail to follow when you are west of
the coordinates you have confirmed. Congratulations to Van der
Decken for the FTF and for putting up with a flooded cache
site!&lt;/p&gt;

Initially cachers had to go to waypoint number 1 and find the 'lost cat' poster shown in the image gallery.  The resting place of the cache was listed on the poster, giving coordinates as to where Cash the cat was last seen.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The poster itself became lost a few times and it has recently been archived. I liked the final location and the whole cache theme so I stuck with it for this new one.  The cache container and the swag remain the same but the logbook has been swapped out for a new one and there is a free slurpee coupon for the first to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bit of a sad note. Frank, my friends cat who's picture I used for the poster, was put down on Christmas eve due to old age and illness. He lived a great life tormenting other household pets and following us to the movie theatre. He was a cranky cat who you sometimes feared to touch, but will be missed greatly and live on in some hilarious memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to the_tower_of_song on being the first to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was created by Zibby Dah.  Zibby has asked me to take care of the Cat while he is away.  It will be my pleasure to cat-sit for a long while.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sorry to hear about Frank... this cache is a nice tribute to him! We recently had to say goodbye to our longtime feline companion, so we came out here for her memory today. Grabbed the bee trackable.

Thanks for getting me to rush out of the office like a cat on a hot tin roof.   I got the email shortly after I started at work and quickly came up with an excuse to, well excuse myself from the office for a short time.  Tracked it down and made the find and was pleased to find a slurpee coupon and a blank log book with the first page reserved for my name and date.  Thanks Zibby Dah for putting this out.  I was always hoping that your multi would be put back up but am happy for this one too. 
Cheers and meow.  Took nothing but brought my travellers along to visit.
Oh, and knowing me, I think I dated the log for the 21st instead of 22nd.

I had to wait out a large contingent of 'nerds' waiting for the Sentry Box to open. Looks like a tournament of some sort. I do not hold out much hope for this cache as the tree has been quite 'changed' since I was last here. Make sure to rehide it carefully so muggles do not see it.

There is a steep cliff/rock band to the south that can be climbed during dry weather, but should be avoided with any form of precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North of 68&lt;/strong&gt; is a smaller sized LnL container with a log book, pencils, and a few trading items. The cache was placed while checking out this fine off-trail area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

After heading west from 22, the snow seemed to deepen. I decided not to head up the driveway to the community centre, and instead parked on the side of the road. The short 200 metre walk to the cache site was just what I needed. The find came quickly due to the terrific hint - what a neat spot! Simply a nice spot and hide - TFTH and fun!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One day on our way into Edmonton, I showed my grandson the first wellsite I surveyed in the Slave Lake area when I moved to this area in 1991. He said &quot;You worked in the bush?!?!&quot; You see he is 14 years old and he never saw me survey in the field. He thought that was pretty cool. This cache is hidden on the access road to that wellsite I surveyed long, long ago. This area has been hit with two forest fires since then and is quite open. In 1991 this was solid bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a compass, not a GPS, to navigate and flag the boundary of the access road from the wellsite to the west of the cache, in to the wellsite I had surveyed with a Theodolite, EDM, and chain. It was in the evening and I was out there by myself much like I am now when caching. I remember singing quite loudly as I flagged through the bush to alert any bears and other wildlife that I was in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The access road is gravel and will be quite slippery when wet, or after a rain. If it is wet you do not want to drive down the hill from the T intersect (approx 60m west of the cache) to the cache. Turn off of the highway at N55° 13.743' W114° 27.566'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PARK ON THE HIGHWAY.
