If you do not have at least a 6-foot reach (height plus length of arm), I would recommend that you bring something sturdy to stand on to reach the cache. I am probably over-exaggerating the difficulty, but better safe than sorry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a microcache that has be camouflaged to fit into its surroundings! :) It is a log only, please BYOP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden just on the outskirts of my retired in-laws property. Please park in the driveway as they roads are narrow and no room to pull off to the side. They are looking forward watching some of the cachers look for the cache, if they are at home. You are more than welcome to ring the door bell and introduce yourselves if you want -- they do not bite!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun and keep on caching!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Texas A&amp;M Sports Museum has the distinction of being the nation's only all-sports museum funded primarily by former athletes. Visitors will experience several different exhibits in the Museum including the Timewall, Legends Gallery, Sport-by-Sport Perimeter Displays, and Interactive Computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The timewall occupies a corridor at the north end of the museum space. Black and white pictures of the earliest days of the university remind visitors of the founder's efforts while bright forms of life and color celebrate a prosperous present and foretell an unbridled future. Large panel size graphics are punctuated by significant artifacts and highlighted by a sequence of programmed light and audio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the exhibit is a gallery that celebrates and reinforces tradition and achievement which are also the core of the university itself. Concrete gray walls and columns create an arena for the display of the university's most treasured symbols of sports success in photographs and memorabilia that recall those uniquely gifted individuals who came before. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Code word answer is the last name on the lower left donor plaque. </groundspeak:long_description>

Yes, that is what once passed for a hwy. Before 1926 it was known as the Texas/Mexico Division of the Bankhead Hwy. The cache is easy to find and does not require walking any tough terrain. This my first cache placement so I would appreciate your feedback.</groundspeak:long_description>

My family's nickname for me is Backroads Sally.  Well, on these back roads I see some pretty interesting and funny things, as well as the occasional tug at the ole' heartstrings.  Gearing up for Issac and the possible contra-flow on the Interstate, I decided to hide some caches at some unique spots along the way that will provide folks an activity to stretch their legs and take a break.

There are three TBs in this cache.  Each has NOLA as its destination, but each wants to see something different.  My niece's TB, Lucky, wants to go to Jackson Square to have its picture made and return to one of flyfshrgrl's caches in Texas.  My nephew's TB, Winters, wants to go to the D-Day Museum to have its picture taken and return to one of flyfshrgrl's caches in Texas, and Cox, my TB, wants to go to Chalmette Battlefield and have its picture taken before returning to one of my cache's in Texas.  We will be tracking their movements, so the kids can learn how and why things move (one of the five themes in Geography). Of course, it's a TB race. Bring your stamp, stamp pad, and pen to log your paper smiley!

NO NEED TO DRY IT; PLEASE DO NOT REPLACE IT WITH REGULAR PAPER!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was in 8th grade, my parents selected a clarinet as my instrument of choice. I took a few lessons through school and then just practiced and learned on my own.&lt;br/&gt;The three years I spent at Calvin, I was in the band - just squeaked in as last chair clarinet. The fun of that position was that when percussion occasionally needed assistance, I was the one called upon to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At that time my &quot;little&quot; brother needed a clarinet, so mine was given to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years my first 5 kids selected other instruments. Finally the 6th one selected a clarinet and I discovered that I could still play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever played a clarinet? Here's your chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you know about a clarinet? Can you answer the following questions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many finger holes? Seven or is it Ten?&lt;br/&gt;Does moisture collect inside? Yes&lt;br/&gt;Does the moisture drain out? Yes&lt;br/&gt;Are they usually black? Usually, but not here,mabey purple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how much water do you think it would take to fill a clarinet? Want to find out? Then try this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A non-musical note - a huge thanks to Caveboy_Ken for the idea for this cache, and also a good TEXAS friend for handing me the container and makin me place it</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Steve McQueen&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Josh
Randall (Steve McQueen) was a man of few words. A bounty hunter by
trade, he tracked his prey all over the West. Randall carried an
1892 44/40 center fire Winchester carbine that he called &quot;Mare's
Laig.&quot; It handled like a revolver but had the punch of a rifle. 
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other bounty hunters, Randall had scruples. He tried to
bring the prisoner in alive and often found himself called upon to
protect people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1960 the character of Jason Nichols (Wright King) was added
to help Randall out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show made a star of Steve McQueen, who unlike many Western
stars, would go on to a memorable film career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: August 12, 2007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Container changed to a drink canister, recycled from another cache.
Cache is located just east of Joe D. Cox who died on Groundhog Day.
Terrain rating upgraded due to some grade changes and thorns in the
area. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to 
KLCE FTF!&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For those that have not heard of him before: Marie Antoine Carême&lt;br /&gt;(8 June 1784–12 January 1833), known as &quot;The King of Chefs,&lt;br /&gt;and the Chef of Kings&quot; was an early practitioner and exponent of&lt;br /&gt;the elaborate style of cooking known as haute cuisine, the &quot;high&lt;br /&gt;art&quot; of French cooking: a grandiose style of cookery favored by&lt;br /&gt;both international royalty and by the newly rich of Paris. Carême&lt;br /&gt;is often considered as one of the first, internationally renowned&lt;br /&gt;celebrity chefs. Born in Paris and abandoned there by destitute&lt;br /&gt;parents in 1792 at the height of the French Revolution, he worked&lt;br /&gt;as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian chophouse in exchange for room&lt;br /&gt;and board. In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly,&lt;br /&gt;a famous pâtissier with a shop near the Palais-Royal. Bailly&lt;br /&gt;recognized his talent and ambition. By the time he was prepared to&lt;br /&gt;leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave&lt;br /&gt;his new employer when a better offer came along. He opened his&lt;br /&gt;shop, the Pâtisserie de la rue de la Paix, which he maintained&lt;br /&gt;until 1813. Carême gained fame in Paris for his pièces montées,&lt;br /&gt;elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly&lt;br /&gt;displayed in the pâtisserie window. He made these confections,&lt;br /&gt;which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs&lt;br /&gt;such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modeled them on temples,&lt;br /&gt;pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural&lt;br /&gt;history books that he studied at the nearby Bibliothèque Nationale,&lt;br /&gt;thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly. He&lt;br /&gt;is credited with the inventions of gros nougats and grosses&lt;br /&gt;meringues, croquantes, made of almonds and honey, and solilemmes.&lt;br /&gt;He did freelance work creating pieces principally for the French&lt;br /&gt;diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, but&lt;br /&gt;also other members of Parisian high society, including Napoleon.&lt;br /&gt;While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he&lt;br /&gt;quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses. Napoleon was&lt;br /&gt;famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of&lt;br /&gt;social relations in the world of diplomacy. In 1804, he gave money&lt;br /&gt;to Talleyrand to purchase Château de Valençay, a large estate&lt;br /&gt;outside Paris. The château was intended to act as a kind of&lt;br /&gt;diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took&lt;br /&gt;Carême with him. Carême was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a&lt;br /&gt;whole year’s worth of menus, without repetition, and using&lt;br /&gt;only seasonal produce. Carême passed the test and completed his&lt;br /&gt;training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoléon,&lt;br /&gt;Carême went to London for a time and served as chef de cuisine to&lt;br /&gt;the Prince Regent, later George IV. Returning to the continent he&lt;br /&gt;followed the invitation of Tsar Alexander I to come to St.&lt;br /&gt;Petersburg, where he lived so briefly he never prepared a meal for&lt;br /&gt;the Tsar before returning to Paris, where he was chef to banker&lt;br /&gt;James Mayer Rothschild. He died in Germany at the age of 48, due&lt;br /&gt;perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the charcoal on&lt;br /&gt;which he cooked. He is remembered as the founder of the haute&lt;br /&gt;cuisine concept and is interred in the Cimetière de Montmartre in&lt;br /&gt;Montmartre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kid Friendly  Lunchtime&lt;br /&gt;Cache  Wheelchair&lt;br /&gt;Access  Dogs Allowed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Available&lt;br /&gt;year-round  Bicycles&lt;br /&gt;permitted on paths  Restrooms available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beware of Muggles!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For those that don't know of him: Georges Auguste Escoffier (28&lt;br /&gt;October 1846 – 12 February 1935) was a French chef,&lt;br /&gt;restaurateur and culinary writer who popularized and updated&lt;br /&gt;traditional French cooking methods. He is a legendary figure among&lt;br /&gt;chefs and gourmets, and was one of the most important leaders in&lt;br /&gt;the development of modern French cuisine. Much of Escoffier's&lt;br /&gt;technique was based on that of Antoine Carême, one of the codifiers&lt;br /&gt;of French haute cuisine, but Escoffier's achievement was to&lt;br /&gt;simplify and modernize Carême's elaborate and ornate style.&lt;br /&gt;Referred to by the French press as &quot;Emperor of the world kitchens&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;Escoffier was France's pre-eminent chef in the early part of the&lt;br /&gt;20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the recipes he recorded and invented, another of&lt;br /&gt;Escoffier's contributions to cooking was to elevate it to the&lt;br /&gt;status of a respected profession by introducing organized&lt;br /&gt;discipline to his kitchens. He organized his kitchens by the&lt;br /&gt;brigade de cuisine system, with each section run by a chef de&lt;br /&gt;partie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1897, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy&lt;br /&gt;Hotel. Ritz and Echenard were implicated in the disappearance of&lt;br /&gt;over £3400 of wine and spirits, and Escoffier had been receiving&lt;br /&gt;gifts from the Savoy's suppliers. By this time, however, Ritz and&lt;br /&gt;his colleagues were already on the point of commercial&lt;br /&gt;independence, having established the Ritz Hotel Development&lt;br /&gt;Company, for which Escoffier set up the kitchens and recruited the&lt;br /&gt;chefs, first at the Paris Ritz (1898), and then at the new Carlton&lt;br /&gt;Hotel in London (1899), which soon drew much of the high society&lt;br /&gt;clientèle away from the Savoy. In addition to the haute cuisine&lt;br /&gt;offered at luncheon and dinner, tea at the Ritz became a&lt;br /&gt;fashionable institution in Paris, and later in London, though it&lt;br /&gt;caused Escoffier real distress: &quot;How can one eat jam, cakes and&lt;br /&gt;pastries, and enjoy a dinner – the king of meals – an&lt;br /&gt;hour or two later? How can one appreciate the food, the cooking or&lt;br /&gt;the wines?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1913, Escoffier met Kaiser Wilhelm II on board the SS&lt;br /&gt;Imperator, one of the largest ocean liners of the Hamburg-Amerika&lt;br /&gt;Line. The culinary experience on board the Imperator was overseen&lt;br /&gt;by Ritz-Carlton, and the restaurant itself was a reproduction of&lt;br /&gt;Escoffier's Carlton Restaurant in London. Escoffier was charged&lt;br /&gt;with supervising the kitchens on board the Imperator during the&lt;br /&gt;Kaiser's visit to France. One hundred and forty-six German&lt;br /&gt;dignitaries were served a large multi-course luncheon, followed&lt;br /&gt;that evening by a monumental dinner that included the Kaiser's&lt;br /&gt;favourite strawberry pudding, named fraises Imperator by Escoffier&lt;br /&gt;for the occasion. The Kaiser was so impressed that he insisted on&lt;br /&gt;meeting Escoffier after breakfast the next day, where, as legend&lt;br /&gt;has it, he told Escoffier, &quot;I am the Emperor of Germany, but you&lt;br /&gt;are the Emperor of Chefs.&quot; This was quoted frequently in the press,&lt;br /&gt;further establishing Escoffier's reputation as France's pre-eminent&lt;br /&gt;chef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escoffier published &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot;, which is still used as&lt;br /&gt;a major reference work, both in the form of a cookbook and a&lt;br /&gt;textbook on cooking. Escoffier's recipes, techniques and approaches&lt;br /&gt;to kitchen management remain highly influential today, and have&lt;br /&gt;been adopted by chefs and restaurants not only in France, but also&lt;br /&gt;throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ritz gradually moved into retirement after opening The Ritz&lt;br /&gt;Hotel in 1906, leaving Escoffier as the figurehead of the Carlton&lt;br /&gt;until his own retirement in 1920. He continued to run the kitchens&lt;br /&gt;through World War I, in which his younger son was killed in active&lt;br /&gt;service. Recalling these years, The Times said, &quot;Colour meant so&lt;br /&gt;much to Escoffier, and a memory arises of a feast at the Carlton&lt;br /&gt;for which the table decorations were white and pink roses, with&lt;br /&gt;silvery leaves – the background for a dinner all white and&lt;br /&gt;pink, Borscht striking the deepest note, Filets de poulet à la&lt;br /&gt;Paprika coming next, and the Agneau de lait forming the high note.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Escoffier died on 12 February 1935, at the age of 88 in Monte&lt;br /&gt;Carlo, a few days after the death of his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kid Friendly  Lunchtime&lt;br /&gt;Cache  No Wheelchair Access&lt;br /&gt; Dogs Allowed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bicycles&lt;br /&gt;permitted on paths  Less than 500&lt;br /&gt;ft. from car to cache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Weather&lt;br /&gt;Permitting  Beware of Muggles!&lt;br /&gt; Bring a pen or pencil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache Placed by a Texas Geocacher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generated by The Selector</groundspeak:long_description>

Bills&lt;/b&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;At one time I was
pretty disappointed that the bills were overdue, but now I just
don't care anymore. Somethings in life you just have to accept and
know that there isn't anything anyone can do about them. When the
time is right and all is going well, the Bills will get paid. Have
fun finding this cache and I look forward to hearing about how
disappointed you are about the &quot;Overdue Bills&quot;. BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;

Bring a picnic lunch and the bikes for the kids. They can safely play while you hunt for this cache.  A curfew after 9:30 PM eliminated this as the make out place it once was. If you like this old type of construction look around and spot some of the relics, like  this hammer forged hinge. You're looking for a bison tube tucked away, it is NOT in plain view. Once you arrive at GZ there is a hint to point out the hide location.  &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Imagine a field of cedars, roughly ½ mile square, of them from 2ft to 20ft tall.   The city is trying to keep the cedars from taking over, but they’ve lost the majority of the field. It shouldn't be that tough, right?  Okay, mix in briers, blackberry and all manner of other plants, animals and creepy crawlies.  Now, you've got a field worthy of the hunt!  You're looking for a cam 1 quart container with some trade items. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinates should be within 9 feet by my Legend.  I strongly suggest putting on the ong pants and boots for this hunt.  Small children should be carried or left at home.  I almost lost the eldest of my caching crew because of her poor choice in foot wear.  There are no paths thru this field, but you can avoid the majority of the bad stuff by picking your way around.   </groundspeak:long_description>

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Whoo hooo … Thank you, so much to every one that put time into making this cache run possible. We had a good time today reaching some year end goals. At one point we realized and a certain cacher (name starts with s) could not find it they just put out there own new container. So we turned it into a game to see just how many containers we could find at each location and sadly we fond two at A LOT of the locations. Thanks again for hiding these.</groundspeak:text>

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.</groundspeak:long_description>

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma.

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table

reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead

series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild

So we turned it into a game to see just how many containers we could find at each location and sadly we fond two at A LOT of the locations. Thanks again for hiding these.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Whoo hooo … Thank you, so much to every one that put time into making this cache run possible. We had a good time today reaching some year end goals. At one point we realized and a certain cacher (name starts with s) could not find it they just put out there own new container. So we turned it into a game to see just how many containers we could find at each location and sadly we fond two at A LOT of the locations. Thanks again for hiding these.</groundspeak:text>

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73.

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73.

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs.

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.</groundspeak:long_description>

By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land

&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The

coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma.

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men.

The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73.

So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted.

To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated.

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.</groundspeak:long_description>

outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs.

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Whoo hooo … Thank you, so much to every one that put time into making this cache run possible. We had a good time today reaching some year end goals. At one point we realized and a certain cacher (name starts with s) could not find it they just put out there own new container. So we turned it into a game to see just how many containers we could find at each location and sadly we fond two at A LOT of the locations. Thanks again for hiding these.</groundspeak:text>

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73.

The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma.

Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73.

So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted.

To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated.

If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

At one point we realized and a certain cacher (name starts with s) could not find it they just put out there own new container.

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;red&quot;&amp;gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;

align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will
navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling
ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and
the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small
towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you
travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are looking for a
wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within
reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals&lt;br /&gt;
in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men.

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73.

reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN
35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County
Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas.
Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead
towards safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since
it is starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there
will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not
placed on other&lt;br /&gt;
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild

At one point we realized and a certain cacher (name starts with s) could not find it they just put out there own new container.

This project will take some time to complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first  Oklahoma Land Run &lt;b&gt; began as a perfect spring day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement. 50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;align=&quot;center&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889, blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of Oklahoma: Guthrie.  The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.  It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16, 1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared &quot;Oklahoma is now a state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie, which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours, replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes, windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits you as you travel through the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN! Whether you are looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the OKLAHOMA LAND RUN puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at coordinatesN 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road 73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma. Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards Texas.The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road 76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards safer roads.  The series does not have end points yet, since it is starting in the center and spreading towards its borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads.  Not all roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and dirt roads. Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other&lt;br /&gt;side fences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname to leave room for future geocashers.  Abusing logs will get your log deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the Oklahoma Land Run&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain, any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild animals&lt;br /&gt;in the area so use Caution!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.okmoments.com/index.php?q=230&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Land Run of 1889.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Stake a claim
on the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is a series of caches that will run across the
whole state east to west! This project will take some time to
complete, but with Oklahoma Geocachers working together it will
happen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The first
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;began as a perfect spring
day--bright, balmy and cloudless. The Oklahoma prairie was green
with the new year, a little glimpse of paradise to the thousands of
land-starved pioneers. This was it, the greatest rush for land in
the history of mankind. More than 2 million acres of unassigned
land in the heart of Indian territory were opened to settlement.
50,000 hopefuls surrounded the area to stake their claim for less
than 12,000 homesteads!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rushers waited impatiently in all the little towns just outside
the new lands: Darlington, Buffalo Springs, Silver City and
Purcell. Then across the territory at high noon on April 22, 1889,
blasts rang out from gun shot, cannon fire and bugle charge and the
race started. During the next six hours, about 10,000 people
settled in what became the capital of the new Territory of
Oklahoma: Guthrie. The U.S. land offices were mobbed, both in
Kingfisher and in Guthrie. Monstrous lines appeared instantly
outside both, as men stood, usually for days, to register their
land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time the red dust settled that evening, a new era had begun
in Oklahoma. The foundation had been laid for this &quot;Sooner&quot; State.
It took legislation, proclamations, five land rushes, a land
lottery, and a land auction, to lead to settlement and eventual
statehood of Oklahoma. At 10:15 on the morning of November 16,
1907, President Roosevelt took a seat at the cabinet table
surrounded by a small delegation of government clerks and newspaper
men. By 10:16 he signed the statehood proclamation and declared
&quot;Oklahoma is now a
state.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The center of series starts north of Guthrie,
which was the first state capital for Oklahoma. The city has
beautiful victorian architecture, which provides a unique backdrop
for Wild West and territorial-style entertainment, carriage tours,
replica trolley cars, specialty shops, and art galleries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will navigate through back roads and byways to explore the
sprawling ranches, endless sky, miles of rolling grass dunes,
windmills and the most unspoiled landscapes in Oklahoma. Discover
charming small towns, scenic beauty, and local history that awaits
you as you travel through the &lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND RUN!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Whether you are
looking for a wonderful day trip or a multiday immersion, the
&lt;b&gt;OKLAHOMA LAND
RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;puts it all within reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
center of the run is located in Guthrie, Oklahoma at
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 54.785 W 097° 23.418&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The west series will carefully navigate you through beautiful
Oklahoma countryside twisting from County Road 76 to County Road
73. Finding its way to County Road 720 to Loyal, Oklahoma.
Traveling north towards Highway 51, following west towards
Texas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series to the east will be a tricky one, following County Road
76 to Highway 33 to highway 51 east out towards Arkansas. Areas in
Tulsa, Oklahoma are high traffic, so the run will lead towards
safer roads. The series does not have end points yet, since it is
starting in the center and spreading towards its
borders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
run will be set up by volunteers only. If you would like to add to
series, please do so! Any help to continue this project will be
great!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The caches were placed near or by either a driveway, a road
shoulder or a turn-off intersection. So please look for these as
your hunting the caches to pull your geocar off the roads. Not all
roadways are paved so use caution while driving down the gravel and
dirt roads.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not cross any fences while geocaching, there will be some
no trespassing signs posted, but all caches are not placed on other
side fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring your own writing stick to sign
logs. When signing logs, please sign only the date and your geoname
to leave room for future geocashers. Abusing logs will get your log
deleted. Please post any great times you had while traveling the
&lt;b&gt;Oklahoma Land
Run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on geocaching.com
logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since they are
placed in rural Oklahoma areas, you will find barbwire by many of
the locations, so please watch your children during the fun. To
keep the run going, please place caches back in same place as you
found. With so many caches on this route, will be hard to maintain,
any help will caches will be much appreciated. There are wild
animals in the area so use
Caution!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had never been on an official number run so I enlisted Hockabee's help to get me as many finds as possible. She got CCF on board and we headed south to beat my one day find record of 31. 19 hours, 675 miles, and 161 caches later, we met our goal! It was a beautiful day followed by a beautiful night with perfect caching weather! Thanks for placing this cache to help me with my quest!

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter this park, you see a big bell on a stone monument. The inscription says, &quot;This is the original Burden fire bell purchased 10-16-14 for S 40.82. Stones are from the old Burden High School. 9-12-76&quot;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geocache is not right here, but nearby. The container is a litle micro sized cylinder with a screw off lid. BYOP, bring your own pencil. I find it easier to roll the logbook and tuck it into the bottom of the lid, then screw the lid back on.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The NSPS Geocaching Project was featured in the March 2007 issue of &lt;i&gt;Point Of Beginning Magazine&lt;/i&gt; at http://tinyurl.com/2wgsfr and also in the online magazine &lt;i&gt;Caching Now&lt;/i&gt; at http://www.cachingnow.com/GeoWise/tabid/2008/Default.aspx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;THE NSPS GEOCACHE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;SAFETY FIRST&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to bring along your geocaching bag/backpack filled with the usual hiking items, such as a bottle of drinking water, cell phone, safety whistle and &quot;swag&quot; items (stuff we all get) for trading. Hiking should always be done with a hiking buddy or a hiking group; if you trip and break your leg, who's going to get you back? Make sure you fuel up your vehicle to get you to the area (and back home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;PARKING&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best place to park to get to this geocache is at a projection from the posted coordinates: from the posted coordinates, go on a bearing of 98 degrees-true (surveyors should read this as &quot;astronomic azimuth of 98 degrees&quot;), for a distance of 0.31 mile. The trail crosses a gravel road at this point and provides for easier access. Once you get there, punch in the posted geocache coordinates and start hiking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;YOU ARE LOOKING FOR...&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are looking for a&lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; container, an ammo box with dimensions of 17 inches long, 14 inches tall, and 7 inches wide. Get a yard stick and check that out. You have to unhitch both ends of the lid in order to get to the goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;ORIGINAL CONTENTS&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items that should stay in the geocache forever:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hardbound logbook (a real surveying field-book); a pen; a pencil; a pencil sharpener; the &quot;You Found It&quot; note with magnet-clippies to hold it up near the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swag trade items:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This list of trade items is provided for tracking purposes (and for your amusement). This geocache was originally stocked with lots of trade items, some being surveying related items and some being just typical swag; due to the container's size, some swag is larger than the usual &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;tuff &lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;e&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ll &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;et. Inside are some &quot;Did You Know&quot; laminated fact-cards held near the top with a magnet-clippie - feel free to take one of these promo-cards without trading for it; 5 CITO canisters with vanilla-scented trash bags inside (left overs from a past CITO event); some NSPS promo 6-inch rulers; some stackable NSPS mini-magic-markers; a sample &lt;i&gt;Point Of Beginning Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, the November 2006 issue signed on the cover by geocacher &lt;i&gt;cantuland&lt;/i&gt;; a coin-purse with a Lewis-and-Clark Edition nickel zipped up inside it; a cowgirl hair baret; a clip-on watch; a little orange hair comb; 5 bracelets, each one hand-crafted by Mrs. cantuland; a cell phone holder; a big patriotic party hat; a really bright safety-orange ball cap with gray underside so as not to blind the wearer; a cool colored floppy frisbie; an umbrella, never opened; a big toy sea turtle (Now you can find a sea turtle in Kansas); 2 little toy plastic dinosaurs - a brachiosaurus and a styracosaurus; a surveyor's &quot;peg book&quot; with lots of trigonometric formulas on the inside cover; a light-up squishy bouncy thing that sparkles with dancing lights when you press down on the top and bottom (press again to stop it so you don't get hypnotized); an 8-inch battery-powered glow stick with several different settings (also hypnotic); a box of division flash cards; surveying pamphlets; 2 &quot;hot-hands&quot; hand warmers; 2 recorder musical instruments; a first-aid kit; a mini A&amp;W mug; a purple silk hanky; a little U.S. flag; and an altoids tin filled with LUCKY pennies (they have given me lots of good luck too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some travel bugs and geocoins originally stocked include the following. Check on their journeys every now and then to see how their doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;TBVT9E - &lt;i&gt;NSPS Geocaching Project Geocoin&lt;/i&gt; that made its first appearance at a KSLS CITO event &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TB11Y6Q - &lt;i&gt;KSLS Traveling Patch #3&lt;/i&gt; touring every geocache in Kansas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TB11HB9 - &lt;i&gt;KSLS Metal Letters #1&lt;/i&gt; looking to visit every state in the U.S. (NOW MISSING)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;FIND IT!&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get to the coordinates, keep in mind that a hand held GPS receiver will only get you &quot;close&quot;. Ask yourself, &quot;Where would a container that huge be hidden?,&quot; and go look there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you find it, be sure to sign the enclosed logbook; date it; describe what you took and what you left; and if you like, include a bit of the story of your adventure. When claiming the find with the online logs, finders are encouraged to mention a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you pursue geocaches placed under the NSPS Geocaching Project, please state how many of these geocaches you have found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many different &quot;Did You Know...&quot; cards have you discovered?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you use this geocache as a place to release your travel bugs or geocoins into the wild, mention in your log what you have released; be sure to include the REFERENCE number rather than the TRACKING number on the tag or coin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Kanza Rail-Trails Conservancy, Inc.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Permission to place this geocache was granted by the KRTC. The placement of the container (*HUGE* container!) was done in cooperation with the hard labor volunteered by the KRTC President. The Kanza Rail-Trails Conservancy, Inc. is a private, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization made up of volunteers who are committed to recreational trail development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Trail Access…under construction.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designated sections of the trail are open to the public for non-motorized recreation, sunrise to sunset. Trails are shared by pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Trail Guidelines…&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trails are open year-round, sunrise to sunset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be alert when crossing all roadways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use public parking (city parks, streets) as close to the trail as possible. Some trailheads will have a parking area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cell phones are recommended for emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no fee to use the trails. However, if you would like to become a member or contribute to the continued development of these trails, our website and contact information is below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Trail Rules…&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pets are allowed on a lead/leash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motorized vehicles are prohibited except for maintenance, law enforcement, emergency vehicles, and motorized wheelchairs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the trail is surrounded by private land. Please stay on the trail and respect the rights of private landowners. Please – no trespassing and no littering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carry out more than you carry in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Campfires, overnight camping, fireworks, fishing, hunting, trapping, swimming, firearms, alcohol, drugs, and loitering are not permitted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Geocaching…&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several geocaches located in the KRTC trail system including the official NSPS geocache! Geocaching and rail-trails are a perfect match – the great outdoors and a beautiful journey to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to place a geocache on the trail, please contact our organization and we will help you find a good site. KRTC Board member Scott Allen of Council Grove is an avid geocacher and can be reached at 620-767-5695. President Gina Poertner would also be happy to assist you in placing a geocache. Contact her at 620-342-2477.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, adjacent farmlands are usually burned off each spring and these “prairie fires” are shared with the trail for weed control. Depending on the container, you may want to temporarily remove the caches during the burning season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BENCH MARKS&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to do your BM research. There are some to be found along the trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

The new placement was made in February, we'll see how it looks in July.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You seek a standard lock-n-lock clearly labeled as a geocache  on the sides.  This is a great place to take a break after the long miles that take you through western Kansas.  Lots of shade and relaxing noises.  The cache has some fun stuff inside for both young and old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rest area can be quite busy at times, please be aware of muggles in the parking area and enjoying the trail.  Make sure you look over your shoulder at the parking lot! </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Over the hills and through the woods...  then down the river to fetch a couple of caches.  

Circumstances conspired last night to make a trip to the area sound like a good and fun idea.  I had a solved a puzzle that hadn't been found yet so could try for the FTF, grab another challenge that was near that one, then go after a couple of these paddler hides.

Got up this morning and threw the kayak in the car, packed up the other accessories and hit the road.  I decided that instead of putting the kayak on top of the car, that I would put it inside the car (highlander).  It fits but I have to use a bungy cord to hold down the back door as it wouldn't close all the way.  It worked like a charm until I got onto the gravel roads.   Dust from the roads filled the car.  Note to self:  don't do that again.

Besides a dirty, trashed car, the trip was great!!  I parked at the specified coordinates, bid a pleasant greeting to the diverse crowd of families and college fun-seekers and began the trip up river.  The paddle was pleasant, scenic and relaxing.  

Got to the area for this second cache and found it quickly after navigating from the creek to gz.  There's a shallow spot just before getting to the cache that I had to portage through but it wasn't bad.  There's quite a bit of PI around the area now and I'm sure to have tromped through it.  I cleaned up well after the visit so should be ok.  Took a little plastic bug and left a pathtag.  Cache and contents are in great shape. Continued the few feet to the obvious turnaround point and took a nice break before heading back.

Great time!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

me, but it's my first one in the Manhattan area. Hope you like my
style. I considered doing a puzzle, but decided otherwise for this
one. I grew up in this area, Manhattan, Ogden, Junction
City...Milford, Tuttle...It's all &lt;i&gt;home&lt;/i&gt; to me. You are
looking for a 30-cal ammo box painted black with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while you're in the
area, if you venture to N 39° 10.256’ W96° 36.033’ you
may find an area to perk up your interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cache In Trash
Out is an environmental activity intimately tied to geocaching.
While out there looking for nearby caches, look around and collect litter
along the trails and properly dispose of it. Practice policies of
Leave No Trace
(LNT.org), the center for outdoor ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland      </groundspeak:long_description>

Took the right shortcut to the cache, then GeePS goes nutso under the canopy. A quick recalibration solved his mental lapse, and then we got back on track to made a quick find. The baggie is still there, along with what looks like the hiding apparatus, but no ammo can. TNLNSL, and Thx4The$!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We placed this cache during our 350.org (River of Action) CITO Event (GC1Z8JW).  It is located on the Kansas River and is classified class I river appropriate for new paddlers.  The river is a class I float, flat water and is good for beginners. It can get swift and fast moving after rains, so plan your trip accordingly. Not many obstacles (strainers), but that can change as well. Trees can fall and create a strainer. The water is usually flat and slow enough to paddle around anything in the way.  You can check river levels at the usgs gauging station website to see if there is enough water to allow you to float the river.  The kansas river should have 1100 cfs of water at this point.  It is a good idea not to paddle alone so take a cache buddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cachers that were at the event signed the container and get to claim this as a find.  However the log book is empty for the next cacher to get a FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I dropped a geocoin in this cache and cannot remember which one it was, also cachers that attended the event supplied lots of swag.  Remember make a fair trade and CITO!  Happy Hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not let the yahoo map fool you it is on an island/sandbar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to JJTally on being the FTF after the event. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A memorial to Dr. Joseph Denison, first president of the&lt;br /&gt;Kansas State Agricultural College and to the pioneers whose&lt;br /&gt;dauntless courage and tireless energy made possible our homes and&lt;br /&gt;comforts of to-day. Riley County Historical Society, 1932.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1855, Denison was convinced by his brother-in-law, Isaac&lt;br /&gt;Goodnow, that he should move to Kansas Territory to help establish&lt;br /&gt;a new town for the New England Emigrant Aid Company. On March 13,&lt;br /&gt;1855, Denison joined a party of Company members leaving Boston, and&lt;br /&gt;made his way to Kansas Territory, which was soon to boil over with&lt;br /&gt;violence. (See Bleeding Kansas.) Over the next several years&lt;br /&gt;Denison was part of a small group that settled and built the&lt;br /&gt;abolitionist town of Manhattan, Kansas, at the union of the Kansas&lt;br /&gt;River and the Big Blue River in the Flint Hills. By 1857 Denison&lt;br /&gt;and Goodnow, along with others, hatched a plan to create a&lt;br /&gt;Methodist college in Manhattan. In April 1857, at a meeting of the&lt;br /&gt;Methodist Church Conference, a plan for the college was properly&lt;br /&gt;inaugurated. The following year, on February 9, 1858, Manhattan's&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Blue Mont Central College&quot; was incorporated by act of the Kansas&lt;br /&gt;Territorial Legislature and Territorial Governor James Denver. By&lt;br /&gt;1860, a large building was erected and the school was open and&lt;br /&gt;operating, with Denison as President. However, the institution was&lt;br /&gt;already struggling financially.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When Kansas was admitted to the United States in 1861, one of&lt;br /&gt;the first things the new state Legislature planned to do was to&lt;br /&gt;establish a state University. After two years of political&lt;br /&gt;wrangling, on February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's&lt;br /&gt;offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds, and&lt;br /&gt;established the state's Land-grant university at the site –&lt;br /&gt;the institution that would become Kansas State University. At the&lt;br /&gt;first meeting of the state Board of Regents on July 23, 1863,&lt;br /&gt;Denison was hired as the first President of Kansas State&lt;br /&gt;Agricultural College. He served in this position for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;During his term, Denison managed a number of important&lt;br /&gt;accomplishments, including establishing a faculty and acquiring&lt;br /&gt;valuable land that would later become the center of the university.&lt;br /&gt;Under his direction, the school attracted Benjamin Franklin Mudge&lt;br /&gt;as Chair of the geology department; Mudge led his Kansas State&lt;br /&gt;students on fossil-collecting expeditions to Western Kansas as part&lt;br /&gt;of the Bone Wars. Despite Denison's accomplishments, the state&lt;br /&gt;asked for his resignation in 1873. After leaving Kansas State,&lt;br /&gt;Denison was hired as President of Baker University, a Methodist&lt;br /&gt;school in Baldwin City, Kansas. He held this position from 1874 to&lt;br /&gt;1879, before retiring to work with the Methodist church in the town&lt;br /&gt;he helped settle, Manhattan. He died on February 19, 1900, in&lt;br /&gt;Manhattan, which had by then grown into a thriving college town of&lt;br /&gt;3,500.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Legolaws for the FTF!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

This actually was a good day to get these, wet enough to be sneaky finding the caches, and cold enough to not have to worry about it. GeePS lead me a little far down the trail, but once I turned back, made a quick find. Did not look hard enough to spot a coin, but it could still be there. TNLNSL, Thx4The$, and quickly running to the next one...tbc

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What you're looking for is a clear container.  This should be an easy find.  Muggles shouldn't be too much of a problem, however, keep your eye out.  In the evening and early mornings, people walk their pets nearby. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking for this cache will be the more difficult part.  There are residential streets a short distance from the GZ.  Please, for your safety, do not park near the interesection.

High winds, heavy rains, lightning, some small hail...you know, Kansas in April. SURELY, no one would go for FTF in this! First thing this morning, get W off to day-care, check the cache is still not logged, get the GPS loaded up and head out just as the rains are stopping. Find the cache easy enough, open it up to grab our first FTF, and what pops out first but that oh-so-familar magnet with those oh-so-familiar initials! 

Really like this cache and location; my sprite 95 y.o. grandmother taught in one like this in SW Kansas many years ago. Good to see it's being kept for the history! TNLNSL, and Thx4the$</groundspeak:text>

The lake is usually calm and easily paddled in a canoe.  There is a fee to enter the park.  If you park and launch at N39 15.321 W096 34.680 you can also rent canoes or kayaks at this location.  Visit the related webpage for phone numbers to call to check availability of boats.  I am including a waypoint where you do not have to pay the entry fee, but you will have to worry about the low head dam.  WARNING Rocky Ford dam area is downstream of this launch.  So be extra careful to make the correct turn into the river pond area.  Use this launching site at your own risk. The coordinates for it are N39 14.834 W096 35.564  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We enjoy canoeing on the river pond and have seen numerous signs of wildlife and waterfowl.  It is smaller so you will not have to contend with motorboats, which is nice.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Prior to July, 1993, the area below the flood spillway was a
gently sloping, grassy recreational area used for dirt bikes.
Erosion was initiated in early July when some water was released
(10,000 to 25,000 cfs) through the gates just to keep the rising
flood waters from running uncontrolled over the top of the
spillway. However, the water level in the reservoir continued to
rise, and all 18 floodgates were opened, greatly accelerating the
erosion processes. In fact, this was the first time since the dam
project was completed in 1962 that the gates were opened. When the
gates were closed later, it was discovered that the landscape of
the spillway channel had been transformed into a craggy,
variegated, and multilayered canyon. Geologists and laymen have
been presented with a unique opportunity to have a horizontal view
of thousands of square meters of strata that usually are observable
primarily in vertical sections (e.g., roadcuts, hillsides,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1993 intense rains raised the level of Tuttle
Creek Lake 61 feet above normal pool and started to overflow the
spillway gates. Up to 60,00 cfs was released at the height of the
flood. The water travel down tothe Kansas river with 380,00 cubic
yards of material eroded from the spillway channel. &quot;... it was
turbulent, rolling, rocking, and cutting as it moved, carrying tons
of sediment that acted like a chisel, a drill, a grinder, and a
thousand bulldozers, all in one. The resulting mass of water hit
the loose and poorly consolidated sediment and rocks below the
spillway lip like a massive explosion — lifting, cutting, and
churning its way ... carrying along hundreds of tons of boulders,
gravel, sands, shale, and limestone which it had just torn loose as
it roared over the rock surface.&quot; (Archer et al., 1993) The roar of
the water could be heard from half a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strata exposed below the spillway have been identified as
Paleozoic, representing late Pennsylvanian through early Permian
systems which, in evolutionary time, are thought to be about 290
million years old. The concrete spillway rests upon the Neva
Limestone and the underlying Salem Point Shale. A variety of both
invertebrate body and trace fossils may be found in the newly
exposed strata (Archer et al., 1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Means of Erosion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock strata below the spillway at Tuttle Creek is marked by
joints (fractures) which represent structural weaknesses (Archer et
al., 1993; Anon., 1993). Such joints, which are roughly parallel
and may extend through strata for long distances horizontally and
vertically, likely contributed to the rocks being ripped away by
the fast moving water. The erosive action was doubtlessly aided by
the velocity of the water and its sediment load which consisted of
abrasive matter such as sand, gravel, boulders, etc. Physical
processes associated with macroturbulent flow, which contribute to
erosion of bedrock during catastrophic flooding, have been
elucidated by Austin (1991b; p. 88). These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Cavitation — a rock pulverizing process resulting from
the implosion or collapse of vacuum bubbles (see also Holroyd,
1990a and 1990b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Plucking, or the hydraulic lifting of large blocks of bedrock
— a suction process which results from the vortex action of a
&quot;kolk&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could such processes have been active in these cases of rapid
canyon formation? Hydraulic plucking obviously occurred, since
large blocks of bedrock were scattered haphazardly downstream at
Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That cavitation may have taken place is not as evident. Holroyd
(1990a, p. 24) instanced data from the Bureau of Reclamation
indicating that cavitation may occur at fluid flow speeds greater
than 30 meters per second (67 mph). Austin (1991b, p. 88) cited
NASA data which suggest that cavitation may be associated with
fluid flows as slow as 30 ft per second (20 mph). It was in fact
earlier noted that water moved down the Manhattan spillway at
60,000 cfs suggesting that conditions conducive to cavitation could
have existed during the canyon's formation. It is also possible
that continued pulverizing and weakening of the rock and subsequent
erosive action could obliterate any direct physical evidence of
cavitation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This earthcache will place you between Tuttle Creek Dam and the
Spillway System. You will need to cross the earthworks dam coming
from the west or the Spillway System coming from the east. There
has been construction to reinforce the dam for several years and
the information sign you are looking for has been inaccessible
during that time. It is along Highway 13 so watch for traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spillway Fault System at Tuttle Creek Dam is a geological
feature that can be seen in the east side of the spillway cut. Rock
layers are offset along diagonal lines that can be traced along the
face of the cut. Signs in the northwest spillway parking lot
identify the faults visible on the opposite wall. These faults were
discovered during investigations prior to construction of the dam.
The faults actually extend across the lake and have been traced in
the hills on the west side of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features have also been traced for several miles to the
east of the spillway. The faults do not extend below any part of
the dam or spillway gates. No earthquakes in historic times have
been associated with these faults. Microseismic studies have been
conducted by the Kansas Geological Survey with funding from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These studies used very sensitive
instruments to detect earthquakes that cannot be felt and did not
show any recent activity related to this fault system. Additional
investigations also show that there are no disturbances in the
surface soils above the fault that indicate any recent
activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These faults are not considered active, and do not pose a danger
to Tuttle Creek Dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK now some educational stuff about faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geologists can categorize faults into three groups based on the
sense of slip:&lt;br /&gt;
1. a fault where the relative movement (or slip) on the fault plane
is approximately vertical is known as a dip-slip fault&lt;br /&gt;
2. where the slip is approximately horizontal, the fault is known
as a transcurrent or strike-slip fault&lt;br /&gt;
3. an oblique-slip fault has non-zero components of both strike and
dip slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all naming distinctions, it is the orientation of the net
dip and sense of slip of the fault which must be considered, not
the present-day orientation, which may have been altered by local
or regional folding or tilting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dip-slip faults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dip-slip faults can be sub-classified into the types &quot;reverse&quot;
and &quot;normal&quot;. A normal fault occurs when the crust is extended.
Alternatively such a fault can be called an extensional fault. The
hanging wall moves downward, relative to the footwall. A downthrown
block between two normal faults dipping towards each other is
called a graben. An upthrown block between two normal faults
dipping away from each other is called a horst. Low-angle normal
faults with regional tectonic significance may be designated
detachment faults.&lt;br /&gt;
A reverse fault is the opposite of a normal fault — the
hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall. Reverse faults
indicate shortening of the crust. The dip of a reverse fault is
relatively steep, greater than 45°.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault, but
with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45°. Thrust faults
typically form ramps, flats and fault-bend (hanging wall and foot
wall) folds. Thrust faults form nappes and klippen in the large
thrust belts.&lt;br /&gt;
The fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface
of a fault. Flat segments of thrust fault planes are known as
flats, and inclined sections of the thrust are known as ramps.
Typically, thrust faults move within formations by forming flats,
and climb up section with ramps.&lt;br /&gt;
Fault-bend folds are formed by movement of the hanging wall over a
non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both
extensional and thrust faults.&lt;br /&gt;
Faults may be reactivated at a later time with the movement in the
opposite direction to the original movement (fault inversion). A
normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice
versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strike-slip faults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fault surface is usually near vertical and the footwall
moves either left or right or laterally with very little vertical
motion. Strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known
as sinistral faults. Those with right-lateral motion are also known
as dextral faults.&lt;br /&gt;
A special class of strike-slip faults is the transform fault, where
such faults form a plate boundary. These are found related to
offsets in spreading centers, such as mid-ocean ridges, and less
commonly within continental lithosphere, such as the Alpine Fault,
New Zealand. Transform faults are also referred to as conservative
plate boundaries, as lithosphere is neither created nor
destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oblique-slip faults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fault which has a component of dip-slip and a component of
strike-slip is termed an oblique-slip fault. Nearly all faults will
have some component of both dip-slip and strike-slip, so defining a
fault as oblique requires both dip and strike components to be
measurable and significant. Some oblique faults occur within
transtensional and transpressional regimes, others occur where the
direction of extension or shortening changes during the deformation
but the earlier formed faults remain active.&lt;br /&gt;
The hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle; it is
the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes
parallel to the fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listric fault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A listric fault is a type of normal fault in which fault plane
is curved. The dip of the fault plane becomes shallower with
depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ring fault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring faults are faults that occur within collapsed volcanic
calderas. Ring faults may be filled by ring dikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for the logging requirements:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Email me with the answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Tell me what type of fault you think the Spillway Fault
System is.&lt;br /&gt;
2. From the information board: Tell me what scale is used in the
map in the upper right corner of the information board.&lt;br /&gt;
3. From the coordnates you can see the spillway to the east. Look
at the end closest to you and find the numbers on the spillway.
Tell me the top most number and the largest number you can
see.&lt;br /&gt;
4. You can also post a picture of yourself at the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks and I hope you enjoy my Earthcache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to JJTally on the FTF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A short, relaxing stroll near Tuttle Creek Lake.  After several years, the hard work of stabilizing the dam has been completed, and this area has been re-opened to the public.  This can be a good place to have a camera, binoculars, or a fishing pole in your caching kit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a preform along a well established trail with a bit of gradient.  Cache is log-and-pencil, might hold very small items that are less than the diameter of a quarter, and should be a relatively easy find.  As with all caches in the area, this one can get more challenging with any rain, snow, ice, snakes, ticks, blah, blah, blah...  This is a dead-end trail, so you'll probably meet any muggles both coming and going.  Cache is placed at approx. 1129 FASL.  FTF Award is a 10 ruble bill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special thanks for this cache goes to &quot;Corp Of Discovery&quot;, who graciously provided the cache container when we met out on the ol' caching trail.  Didn't take too long to figure out where the next &quot;Corps&quot; cache should go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to susan.c and AltCtrl for First To Find!&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed near the former town of Stockdale, at approximately 1109 feet above sea level. A map showing the location of Stockdale is included in the cache. Depending on lake levels, alternate routes to easy parking near the cache are possible, then some moderate bushwhacking to the cache from there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible, though not required, to access this cache by boat. If you choose this route, please take note of lake conditions and wear your life jackets! &lt;br/&gt;July 4, 2009 marks the 50th Anniversary of the closure of the Big Blue River, and the creation of Tuttle Creek Reservoir. This cache was placed in commemoration of this event and to explore the many towns affected by the creation of the reservoir. Some of these towns have prospered, others have become a footnote to history; all are worth remembering and exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The routes to each of these caches will lead you through the Flint Hills of Kansas and the Big Blue River Valley, some of the prettiest scenery in the state. You will travel U.S. and State highways, well-maintained county roads, and not-so-well-maintained roads. There are also numerous possible ways to get to any one cache, a detailed map showing the winding county roads is advised. Weather permitting, 4WD should not be necessary for any cache…weather permitting! All caches in this series are plastic Lock-N-Locks with Geocaching markings, and are on public property. Please respect any private property near the cache stages. All caches are placed above 1075 FASL; however, changing water elevations within the reservoir may increase the challenge of finding any one! Current water elevations may be found on the U.S. Corps of Engineers webpage listed below (follow the “Daily Lake Information” link).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuttle Creek Reservoir was constructed primarily for flood control along the Big Blue River. The normal water elevation in Tuttle Creek is 1075 FASL. The all-time maximum water elevation in Tuttle Creek Reservoir was reached on July 23, 1993; 1137.77 feet, almost 63 feet above flood stage! Since its construction, Tuttle Creek Reservoir has been credited in preventing over $3 Billion dollars of flood damage from the dam just north of Manhattan to the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers in Kansas City, Kansas. Numerous year-round recreational activities are also provided by the reservoir, including camping, boating, fishing, hunting, and geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates of the dam at the outlet structure are N39 15.213 W096 36.104. These coordinates are given simply to track the extent of Tuttle Creek Reservoir, and are not needed to find any cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Alien Bounty Hunter for FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The scenic attributes of the tallgrass prairie: spaciousness,
expansive grasslands, and rolling terrain are exemplified in the
Flint Hills. The least disturbed and largest remaining tracts of
tallgrass prairie lie in the Flint Hills, a sixty mile wide band
extending from Oklahoma to this area. This region is truly unique
in the North American landscape, and is worthy of preservation as a
resource of national signifigance.&lt;br /&gt;
The Flint Hills are underlain by layers of limestone and shales
which were deposited by ancient inland seas that covered the mid
continent millions of yeras ago. Large quantities of flint and
chert nodules formed within the limestone, as percolating waters
dropped silica around bits of shell and plant stems.&lt;br /&gt;
Later the region was uplifted and the seas drained. Sixty million
years of erosion removed the overlying sediments. The limestones,
more arrestant than the shales, formed the numerous ridges. The
hard, insoluble chert nodules have been left behind to give the
Flint Hills their name. The flat topped hills and deeply dissected
scarps with terraced slopes provide splendid scenic vistas.
&lt;p&gt;The Flint Hills were created approximately 250 million years ago
during the Permian Period. During this time much of the Midwest,
including Kansas and Oklahoma, were covered with shallow seas. As a
result, much of the Flint Hills are composed of limestone and shale
with plentiful fossils of prehistoric sea creatures. The most
notable layer of chert-bearing limestone is the Florence Limestone
Member. It is approximately 45 feet thick; numerous roadcuts of the
Florence Member are prominent along Interstate 70 in Riley County,
Kansas. Many of the honey-colored limestones have been used for
building blocks. The non-chert-bearing limetones are best for this,
since the chert is extremely hard to cut, yet it can fracture quite
easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the mid-1800s homesteaders replaced the American
Indian in the Flint Hills. Due to shallow outcroppings of limestone
and chert, farming was not practical over much of the area, and
cattle ranching became the main agricultural activity in the
region. Still sparsely developed, the Flint Hills represent the
last expanse of tallgrass prairie in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, go to the coordinates and find the plaque/sign and email
me the name of the person who gave the quote written on the
plaque/sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, look to the west and include in your email your best
guess as to how tall the limestone hill is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, take a picture of yourself in front of the Flint Hills at
this location. Hope you enjoy the trip through the Flint Hills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to JJTally on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;This is the land where tallgrasses reign supreme, where tree is a stranger.  Big bluestem, switchgrass, and Indiangrass predominate, joining a host of broad-leaved forbs with remarkable flowers and seed heads.  Thriving on warm humid summers, this complex array of deep-rooted plants is well adapted to fire, droughts, and grazing.  Annual growth of six feet or more results in vast stands of grass, waving and rolling as the ancient seas which gave birth to the Flint Hills.&lt;br/&gt;The treeless, grassy expanse once supported countless bison, elk, and pronghorn, stealthily surveyed by the grey wolf.  Although these natives have vanished, victims of the Euroamericn settlers, the tallgrass prairie manages to flourish as it has for millennia.  Adaptable to all but human intrusion, the fate of these virgin stands rests with us.  Recognintion of the Flint Hills' significance, and an understanding of the role we must assume in the conservation of this unique resource, are critical if the Flint Hills are to be preserved ar the largest remaining intact tallgrass prairie on the continent.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from a plaque at the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck and happy hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations  KS_Pyro FTF! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed near the former town of Garrison at approximately 1130 feet above sea level.  A map showing the location of Garrison is included in the cache.  Parking is located nearby, with a light hike along an unmaintained trail to the cache.  During winter, access to this cache by vehicle on the road may be tricky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible, though not required, to access this cache by boat.  If you choose this route, please take note of lake conditions and wear your life jackets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;July 4, 2009 marks the 50th Anniversary of the closure of the Big Blue River, and the creation of Tuttle Creek Reservoir.  This cache was placed in commemoration of this event and to explore the many towns affected by the creation of the reservoir.  Some of these towns have prospered, others have become a footnote to history; all are worth remembering and exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The routes to each of these caches will lead you through the Flint Hills of Kansas and the Big Blue River Valley, some of the prettiest scenery in the state.  You will travel U.S. and State highways, well-maintained county roads, and not-so-well-maintained roads.  There are also numerous possible ways to get to any one cache, a detailed map showing the winding county roads is advised. Weather permitting, 4WD should not be necessary for any cache…weather permitting.  All caches in this series are plastic Lock-N-Locks with Geocaching markings, and are on public property.  Please respect any private property near the cache stages.  All caches are placed above 1075 FASL; however, changing water elevations within the reservoir may increase the challenge of finding any one!  Current water elevations may be found on the U.S. CoE webpage listed below (follow the “Daily Lake Information” link).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuttle Creek Reservoir was constructed primarily for flood control along the Big Blue River.  The normal water elevation in Tuttle Creek is 1075 FASL.  The all-time maximum water elevation in Tuttle Creek Reservoir was reached on July 23, 1993; 1137.77 feet, almost 63 feet above flood stage!  Since its construction, Tuttle Creek Reservoir has been credited in preventing over $3 Billion dollars of flood damage from the dam just north of Manhattan to the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers in Kansas City, Kansas.  Numerous year-round recreational activities are also provided by the reservoir, including camping, boating, fishing, hunting, and geocaching.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is cache #4 of a 10 part series touring Tuttle Creek Reservoir and the Big Blue River valley. This cache is placed near the former location of the town of Irving at approximately 1170 feet above sea level. Parking is located nearby with a short walk to the cache from there. This cache is located in a public hunting area, please note any active hunting seasons and share the space, there’s plenty of room for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;July 4, 2009 marks the 50th Anniversary of the closure of the Big Blue River, and the creation of Tuttle Creek Reservoir. This cache was placed in commemoration of this event and to explore the many towns affected by the creation of the reservoir. Some of these towns have prospered, others have become a footnote to history; all are worth remembering and exploring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The routes to each of these caches will lead you through the Flint Hills of Kansas and the Big Blue River Valley, some of the prettiest scenery in the state. You will travel U.S. and State highways, well-maintained county roads, and not-so-well-maintained roads. There are also numerous possible ways to get to any one cache, a detailed map showing the winding county roads is advised. Weather permitting, 4WD should not be necessary for any cache…weather permitting! All caches in this series are plastic Lock-N-Locks with Geocaching markings, and are on public property. Please respect any private property near the cache stages. All caches are placed above 1075 FASL; however, changing water elevations within the reservoir may increase the challenge of finding any one! Current water elevations may be found on the U.S. CoE webpage listed below (follow the “Daily Lake Information” link).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuttle Creek Reservoir was constructed primarily for flood control along the Big Blue River. The normal water elevation in Tuttle Creek is 1075 FASL. The all-time maximum water elevation in Tuttle Creek Reservoir was reached on July 23, 1993; 1137.77 feet, almost 63 feet above flood stage! Since its construction, Tuttle Creek Reservoir has been credited in preventing over $3 Billion dollars of flood damage from the dam just north of Manhattan to the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers in Kansas City, Kansas. Numerous year-round recreational activities are also provided by the reservoir, including camping, boating, fishing, hunting, and geocaching. For more information on these, and a more complete history of the Reservoir, please see:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Tuttle Creek Reservoir&lt;br/&gt;http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/tc/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, Tuttle Creek Wildlife Area&lt;br/&gt;http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/KDWP-Info/Locations/Wildlife-Areas/Region-2/Tuttle-Creek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates of the dam at the outlet structure are N39 15.213 W096 36.104. These coordinates are given simply to track the extent of Tuttle Creek Reservoir, and are not needed to find any cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to gjt&amp;s14 for FTF!! </groundspeak:long_description>

It is a bit sad and somewhat creepy to know that once people lived here and cared enough to put out a marker naming their town and now everyone seems gone.  Great cache series I am enjoying everyone.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

But allow enough time to take the trails, and learn a little of the history of this place. Alcove Spring was a stop on the Oregon Trail. There are wagon swales to view, A spring, carvings of pioneers from 1840's, and many other things. &lt;br/&gt;There is a self guided, clearly marked, walking trail around the whole area. &lt;br/&gt;This is where the pioneers crossed the Blue River. The crossing is named Independence. To the north is the camp ground. Some had to stay too long, others could get right across depending on how high the water was. &lt;br/&gt;Please be sure to explore both sides of the road. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A spring is any natural occurrence where water flows on to the
surface of the earth from below the surface, and is thus where the
aquifer surface meets the ground surface.
&lt;p&gt;A spring may be the result of karst topography where surface
water has infiltrated the Earth's surface (recharge area), becoming
part of the area groundwater. The groundwater then travels though a
network of cracks and fissures - openings ranging from
intergranular spaces to large caves. The water eventually emerges
from below the surface, in the form of a spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a
confined aquifer in which the recharge area of the spring water
table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring
water forced to the surface by elevated sources are artesian wells.
This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a 300-foot
deep cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher
elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower
elevation opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonartesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation
through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a
spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still other springs are the result of pressure from an
underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic activity.
The result can be water at elevated temperature as a hot
spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable
bedrock such as limestone and dolmite creating vast cave
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of spring outlets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seepage or filtration spring. The term seep refers to springs
with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered into
permeable earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fracture springs, discharge from faults, joints, or fissures in
the earth, in which springs have followed a natural course of voids
or weaknesses in the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tubular springs are essentially water dissolved and create
underground channels, basically cave systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springs mark the intersection between human and natural history.
There is probably no better example in Kansas than Alcove Spring in
southern Marshall County. Water flows from Permian limestone into a
shallow pool covered with watercress, before making its way to the
nearby Big Blue River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just above the spring is an intermittent waterfall. This is a
noted stop along the Oregon Trail; in 1846, traveler George L.
Curry wrote that &quot;the water is of the most excellent kind.…&quot;
In 1951, Survey geologist Walter Schoewe wrote, &quot;Water, pure and
cold, issuing from the springs gives rise to a streamlet 3 to 4
feet wide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to comprehend what it must have been like for the
pioneers who traveled the Oregon Trail in the mid 1800's. Traveling
at the pace that a person could walk, it took all summer to make
the cross country trek . Imagine their relief and delight then to
be greeted after a few weeks in their journey by the beauty of
Alcove Spring. The spring itself gurgles up from the base of the
alcove. A wet-weather creek flows over the ledge of rocks and into
the pool below to form a beautiful ten foot waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The ill-fated Donner Party camped at Alcove Spring from May 26
to May 31 1846, waiting for the Blue River to go down so that they
could safely cross at nearby Independence Crossing. In fact, it was
one of their party, Edwin Bryant, who named the spring Alcove
Spring. The first member of the Donner Party to die was Sarah
Keyes, and she did so while they were camped at Alcove Springs. The
70 year-old Keyes, who was in poor health before she started the
journey, was in route to Idaho to see her son there one last time.
Though the exact location of her grave site has been lost to
history, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed and
dedicated a marker for her at Alcove Spring in 1950. It is at the
edge of the parking lot and about 1/4 mile from the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging requirements:Email the answers to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What type of spring and outlets do you think Alcove Spring
is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. On the plaque at the coordinates whose journal was quoted
from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. On the plaque, Who provided the photo of the carving on the
rock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Take a picture of yourself with the falls in the
background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Phil &amp; Verla from OZ on the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

When we first got to the springs we looked around and admired them and neglected to get our photos first thing. So the ones we post will be by the light of the flash. It took us a while to find the name etched into the rock but it was fun to see it once we found it. It was fun thinking about how this place looked surrounded by travellers in wagons heading west. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Alcove Spring was a rest stop,  and a place to ford the Blue River.  You can see the wagon swales, the carvings left in the rocks by the early travelers, and see where they forded the river.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While here follow the many trails, find the other caches here (there are 2 others), experience some of what the Indians, trappers, and pioneers felt.  You will see the beauty of this part of Kansas, that people are surprised exists.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan some extra time here to hike the many trails.  There are 7 miles  of  well marked trails here in the park.  You will find a spring that never goes dry, woods, meadows, hills, and vistas to view.   &lt;br/&gt;Marysville to the north has 5  caches and Blue Rapids to the south has 3 caches.  Come spend some time in our beautiful part of  Kansas.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a large plastic coffee jar with a red lid.  The usual trade items.  Nothing of great value.  For the first to find there is a new Travel Bug for you to activate.  Please let me know where you place it.  I'd like to follow it.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck and Happy Caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

We looked around a little bit before she spotted the point that made the most sense and brought me over. Of course that is where it is! The easiest way to get to it was the most difficult way as far as terrain goes. I was wearing shoes that are pretty worn and slick on the bottom, and I did almost go for a slide a couple of times. However, we were able to overcome these obstacles and sign the log. This is a neat little place with a really cool view, a perfect spot for a cache! Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

Rather than accept their offer of membership in their school, Dukes attempted to destroy them as the Blob. Recruited thereafter by Magneto to become a member of his BROTHERHOOD OF EVIL MUTANTS, the Blob embarked on a life of crime, clashing with not only with the X-Men, but also with the AVENGERS and the DEFENDERS. For awhile, he worked with the government-sponsered FREEDOM FORCE, but later returned to crime. After M-day, the Blob lost his powers and much of his mass, but his skin did not snap back and hung on him in folds. Soon after, he joined X-Cell, a group of angry, depowered mutants. He's since lost the extra skin and is promoting himself as a weight-loss success story in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;Stay tuned for more true believers...</groundspeak:long_description>

In this cemetery you will find a Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, Serg. Jacob C. Miller. He served in the Civil War as a Private in Company G, 113th Illinois Volunteer Infantry. He was awarded the CMOH for his bravery at Vicksburg, Mississippi on May 22, 1863. His citation reads &quot;Gallantry in the charge of the &quot;volunteer storming party&quot;. His Medal was awarded to him on August 20, 1894.

To solve this puzzle you will need to visit his headstone and use the information on it to get the final location.

Final - N 41 08.ABC W 096 02.DEF

A = His unit number added up (# # #)

B = 2nd digit of the year of his death

C = 4th digit of the year of his death

D = 4th digit of the year he was born

E = 4th digit of the last year he served in the Grand Army of the Republic

F = the month he was born

to pir2^3 on the First To Solve and Find! 

 Don't do any searching at the published coordinates, unless you are
wearing a police uniform! (it's the parking lot for the police
station )
&lt;p&gt;Located 13 miles from the Omaha VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR),
the GRETT intersection is used by aircraft flying in the clouds(as
well as those flying in good weather) as reporting point. A named
place that they will fly by on their way to Omaha, or a place where
they will begin navigation away from Omaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRETT can by identified by tuning two radios, The VOR reciever,
and one of the following, A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) at the
Plattsmouth airport, or a Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) that
communicates with the Omaha VOR. It can also be identified with a
GPSr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located as close as I could get and not have the
cache plowed in the spring, or make the nearby police nervous
. The coordinates are, of course,
published, just not here. You have to know where to look for them.
Once you get those coordinates, convert them to dd mm.mmm, then
just add .051 to the longitude and you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Goodness Sake, Don't park on 72nd Street! Way too much
comatose traffic on that street!&lt;/p&gt;

Had solved this one a few weeks ago... guess I had been afraid it would be hard to solve, but didn't have much trouble, should have done it sooner. Lots of family in town visiting... six of us went out to get it including GuitarMan24 and GeoKid#3. A first time cacher in our group led us to ground zero and I spotted this nice big cache as we approached. GM24 retrieved it for us and we made a few trades. Great cache and a good hide...

It is the lightest of the metals, with a density approximately half that of water. Under ordinary conditions, lithium is the least dense of the solid elements. It has the highest specific heat of any solid element. Metallic lithium is silvery in appearance. It reacts with water, but not as vigorously as does sodium. Lithium imparts a crimson color to flame, although the metal itself burns a bright white. Lithium is corrosive and requires special handling. Elemental lithium is extremely flammable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Lithium is used in heat transfer applications. It is used as an alloying agent, in synthesizing organic compounds, and is added to glasses and ceramics. Its high electrochemical potential makes it useful for battery anodes. Lithium chloride and lithium bromide are highly hygroscopic, so are used as drying agents. Lithium stearate is used as a high-temperature lubricant. Lithium has medical applications, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: Lithium does not occur free in nature. It is found in small amounts in practically all igneous rocks and in the waters of mineral springs. The minerals that contain lithium include lepidolite, petalite, amblygonite, and spodumene. Lithium metal is produced electrolytically from the fused chloride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

A BIT OF HISTORY:&lt;br /&gt;
Built in 1890, this one-room schoolhouse was constructed south of
the township of Portal, Nebraska, in Sarpy County. The town of
Portal was abandoned in the early 1900's due to frequent flooding.
Most of its residents moved to nearby Papillion. The Portal School
was still utilized for many years and was the last rural
eight-grade school to close its doors in Sarpy County. In 1995 the
old school building was moved from 114th and Giles to 242 North
Jefferson Street in Papillion and placed next to the historic
Sautter House.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The John Sautter Farmhouse is a distinctly German structure. The
dwelling, of nogged-frame construction, was built in the late 1860s
by John Sautter, Sr., a native of Wurttemberg, Germany. Sautter
operated a grist mill for a number of years and served as one of
the founders of the First Lutheran Church of Papillion. The Sautter
House stood originally on a farm located just north of the present
city limits of Papillion. In the 1970s housing developments
destroyed the original farm setting. The house was moved in 1979,
saving it from demolition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both buildings are owned and maintained by the Papillion Area
Historical Society.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A historical (Memorial) cache dedicated to the South Omaha Airport.  Easy find for most.  Original contents include some airplanes, and an evil &quot;nano&quot; for the First to Find! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When I was younger (much younger!) I always wanted to fly out of the South Omaha Airport.  Alas, I was too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--This is an excerpt from &quot;Abandoned and Little-Known Airfields&quot;&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;This small general aviation airport was evidently established at some point between 1945-48 (like hundreds of other general aviation fields across the U.S.), as it was not yet depicted on the September 1945 Lincoln Sectional Chart. The earliest depiction of South Omaha Airport which has been located&lt;br/&gt;was on the September 1948 Lincoln Sectional Chart. It depicted the field as having a 2,400' unpaved runway.&lt;br/&gt;Two B-25 Mitchell bombers sat at South Omaha Airport for years:&lt;br/&gt;“The B-25s arrived at South Omaha airport in 1959 with the intent to be converted to tankers. Due to unknown circumstances, they sat untouched for several years. I can't remember the company name or the individuals who  purchased the planes, but they were known as 'The B-25 King'.”&lt;br/&gt;“The Cub was the local trainer belonging to Harry McCandless who was the FBO. He relocated from the former Council Bluffs Airport [in IA].”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Nelson Carpenter, “Two B-25 bombers had sat idle along the edge of the airfield for years. The original owner of the bombers was going to convert them into tankers for fighting forest fires. That never matured. The planes were sold to a movie company that retrofitted new engines and made them airworthy for flying off the sod field.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Gurkin provided additional details about the B-25s at South Omaha Airport:&lt;br/&gt;“My brother was stationed at Offutt AFB in the early 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;I was visiting with him in November 1980 when one of his friends mentioned there are 2 B-25s at South Omaha Airport&lt;br/&gt;being readied for a ferry flight to California. We grabbed our cameras &amp; drove to the airport where there was a small group of people gathered to witness the event. B-25 N3442G was the 1st of the planes to fly. N3442G departed South Omaha airport in late afternoon with only enough fuel to fly to Eppley Field, Omaha's main airport. The pilots said they wanted the maintenance crew to inspect the aircraft after the short flight&lt;br/&gt;and if all was well, they would top the tanks &amp; head west.&lt;br/&gt;I can't recall when the 2nd aircraft was ferried from South Omaha.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mike Zimmer recalled, “While stationed at Offutt AFB,&lt;br/&gt;I often rented a 152 or 172 from the South Omaha FBO.&lt;br/&gt;The people who ran the operation were a husband &amp; wife team. He was a Lt Col who flew the E-4B (emergency airborne command center) at Offutt and his wife handled the books (very nice folks). During the summer, they would organize a mass launch from South Omaha to any nearby fly-in breakfast.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mike Zimmer recalled, “The Lt Col [who operated South Omaha Airport] retired from the Air Force in the summer of 1985 and they moved to MN where he flew for Northwest Airlines. The FBO was shut down but the field remained operational for the people who hangared their planes there.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Nelson Carpenter, “The airport closed in the mid-1980s following the early death of Harry McCandless. The soon-to-be developer of Eagle Ridge had bought the airport leaving it open for a very short period until he finally closed it.&lt;br/&gt;Apparently there was a better return on his investment with the construction and sale of new houses.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The South Omaha Airport was closed by 1986,&lt;br/&gt;as it was no longer listed among active airfields in the 1986 Flight Guide (according to Chris Kennedy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mike Zimmer recalled, “By the time I left Offutt in 1987, the planes [at South Omaha Airport] were gone as well as the hangars &amp; FBO building.”&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;If you stand just to the east of the cache, at the coordinates listed, and look to the southeast (Heading 150 for you pilots), you will be taking in a view similar to what a pilot getting ready to take off on runway 15 (later runway 14), albeit, without all the houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;151TNPK - &quot;Approach End&quot; of runway 15&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 09.685 W 096° 00.480&lt;br/&gt;Stand here, looking SouthEast, and you'll be looking at what a pilot might have seen (without the houses)&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This 2-stage multi-cache is placed in Schwer Park. Stage 1 is a micro and is rather unique (see hint). Stage 2 is a good size lock-n-lock container. As with any cache, please use stealth to conceal the location from muggles along the walking path and re-hide the container well. I suggest that you take the stage 2 cache to the nearby picnic table and enjoy the view of the lake while you sign the log and do your trading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had walked around Schwer Park several times scouting out places to hide a cache. One spot in particular &quot;struck&quot; me and reminded me of my favorite band Carbon Leaf. The staged caches are hidden in places referenced in Carbon Leaf song lyrics. In particular, listen to the song &quot;Indecision&quot; on their 2009 album release &quot;Nothing Rhymes with Woman&quot;. It might be fun to trade things in this cache that are referenced in other Carbon Leaf song lyrics. If you are not familiar with the band, here are some suggestions: &quot;a pine cone dipped in glitter glue&quot;, &quot;a penny 1942&quot;, &quot;x-ray goggles&quot; or an &quot;x-ray gun&quot;, a &quot;bag of bones&quot;, or even &quot;Olive Oyl&quot;. If you do think of something clever to leave, log which song and lyrics it represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints:&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 10.125 W 096° 03.286 - Schwer Park Parking Lot&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 10.005 W 096° 03.268 - The Lightning tree, inspiration for this hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If you detect any &quot;Drops of Rain&quot;, grab the &quot;Block of Wood&quot; at stage 1 quickly or you may get &quot;Electrified like a lightning tree&quot;.

For some reason I had the urge to do a multi and this one seemed easy enough. Got to the park and scanned it before I left the warmth of the truck. It looks very doable so off to stage 1. Got there in a matter of a skip and a jump. Found what I needed and moved on to the final stop. Easy peasy! TFTC

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Quick park and grab near Schwer Park. Parking is available (N41° 10.124   W096° 3.291) 150 feet from ground zero. Muggles might be walking by, in the parking lot, driving on the street, or in nearby houses... so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab.  Bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. The experiment continues... first, the container was proven to be waterproof as long as you replace the lid tightly (please do). Second, they seem to be holding up in the elements, at least for the short term. Next experiment is internal log construction... trying a more secure method of attaching the log to the lid to ensure quick and simple log extraction and to reduce maintenance issues. Let me know if you have any comments/annoyances with these containers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************************* SULFUR *************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Number: 16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Known since prehistoric time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Sanskrit: sulvere, Latin: sulpur, sulphurium: words for sulfur or brimstone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Sulfur has a melting point of 112.8°C (rhombic) or 119.0°C (monoclinic), boiling point of 444.674°C, specific gravity of 2.07 (rhombic) or 1.957 (monoclinic) at 20°C, with a valence of 2, 4, or 6. Sulfur is a pale yellow, brittle, odorless solid. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in carbon disulfide. Multiple allotropes of sulfur are known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Sulfur is a component of gunpowder. It is used in the vulcanization of rubber. Sulfur has applications as a fungicide, fumigant, and in the making of fertilizers. It is used to make sulfuric acid. Sulfur is used in the making of several types of paper and as a bleaching agent. Elemental sulfur is used as an electrical insulator. The organic compounds of sulfur have many uses. Sulfur is an element that is essential for life. However, sulfur compounds can be highly toxic. For example, small amounts of hydrogen sulfide can be metabolized, but higher concentrations can quickly cause death from respiratory paralysis. Hydrogen sulfide quickly deadens the sense of smell. Sulfur dioxide is an important atmospheric pollutant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: Sulfur is found in meteorites and native in proximity to hot springs and volcanoes. It is found in many minerals, including galena, iron pyrite, sphalerite, stibnite, cinnabar, Epsom salts, gypsum, celestite, and barite. Sulfur also occurs in petroleum crude oil and natural gas. The Frasch process may be used to obtain sulfur commercially. In this process, heated water is forced into wells sunk into salt domes in order to melt the sulfur. The water is then brought to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed along a paved walking path in the Portal Ridge neighborhood. After you find it, take the cache to the nearby bench to sign the log. As with any cache, please use stealth to conceal the location from muggles on the walking path and re-hide the container well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original cache was a screw top plastic container with sufficient room for trades, travel bugs, and coins. Unfortunately after several mugglings, I have replaced it with a micro until I can come up with something better. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park on the street, near the following coordinates: N 41° 10.378 W 096° 04.262. Google Maps Street View gives you a nice view of the sidewalk leading to this cache from this location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the usual log, pen, pencil and trinkets, the cache also originally contains a First To Find prize. It is a trackable &quot;Cache In, Trash Out&quot; micro coin with an activation code so you can activate it and send it out as your own trackable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bit of history of the area:&lt;br/&gt;Founded in the late 1880s, Portal was a small town which was situated on Sections 16, 17, and 21 of Township 14, Range 12. It was platted by the Portal Land and Town Lot Company and it was possibly named for the portal of the western gateway. This small railroad town was predated by a one-room school and cemetery; both of which remain. It was located along the Union Pacific Railroad, northwest of Papillion, on Giles Road, between 108th and 114th Streets. A German Methodist church, bank, newspaper office and several stores sprang up in Portal in the late 1880s. The post office was established April 23, 1887. But frequent floooding and the depression of the 1890s sapped the strength of the growing community and it faded into oblivion. The post office was discontinued August 24, 1898. Portal's peak population was twenty-five in the 1890 census, though another source cited a population of sixty at one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-room school house was moved from 114th and Giles to 242 North Jefferson in Papillion and was the site of the now archived cache &quot;Hatchet House&quot; (GC12XFB). I placed a new cache &quot;Portal School&quot; (GC2D5W7) at the same location. Portal Cemetary is located at 108th and Chandler Road and contains the cache &quot;Rest In Peace&quot; (GCTV16). The Portal Ridge neighborhood where this cache is located is just to the southeast of the former location of Portal on land that was owned by Ernest Petersen. View the gallery for maps of the area from 1889 as well as a satellite view of the same area today.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Fluorine is a corrosive pale yellow gas. It is highly reactive, participating in reactions with virtually all organic and inorganic substances. Fluorine is the most electronegative element. Metals, glass, ceramics, carbon, and water will burn with a bright flame in fluorine. It is possible that fluorine can substitute for hydrogen in organic reactions. Fluorine has been known to form compounds with rare gases, including xenon, radon, and krypton. Free fluorine has a characteristic pungent odor, detectable at concentrations as low as 20 ppb. Both elemental fluorine and the fluoride ion are highly toxic. The recommended maximum allowable concentration for a daily 8-hour time-weighted exposure is 0.1 ppm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Fluorine and its compounds are used in producing uranium. Fluorochlorohydrocarbons are used in refrigeration applications. Fluorine is used to produce many chemicals, including several high-temperature plastics. The presence of sodium fluoride in drinking water at the level of 2 ppm may cause mottled enamel in teeth, skeletal fluorosis, and may be associated with cancer and other diseases. However, topically applied fluoride (toothpaste, dental rinses) has been shown to help reduce dental caries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

'acid former'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Oxygen gas is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. The liquid and solid forms are a pale blue color and are strongly paramagnetic. Oxygen supports combustion, combines with most elements, and is a component of hundreds of thousands of organic compounds. Ozone (O3), a highly active compound with a name derived from the Greek word for 'I smell', is formed by the action of an electrical discharge or ultraviolet light on oxygen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Oxygen was the atomic weight standard of comparison for the other elements until 1961 when the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry adopted carbon 12 as the new basis. It is the third most abundant element found in the sun and the earth, and it plays a part in the carbon-nitrogen cycle. Excited oxygen yields the bright red and yellow-green colors of the Aurora. Oxygen enrichment of steel blast furnaces accounts for the greatest use of the gas. Large quantities are used in making synthesis gas for ammonia, methanol, and ethylene oxide. It is also used as a bleach, for oxidizing oils, for oxy-acetylene welding, and for determining carbon content of steel and organic compounds. Plants and animals require oxygen for respiration.

Pulled up to near this one with coupleofbucks and GuitarMan24. Used the satellite view on the iPhone to put us right at ground zero for an instant find. Not much of a log left on this one, but looks like recent finders had used a scrap of paper for a makeshift log. cob had a proper log in the car, so we put one in a baggie and signed it. Had a sense of deja vu on this one having found another cache nearby that must now be archived. Thanks for adding a smiley to a HOT afternoon of caching papazulu1186!

Lots of muggles around at times, so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab. Bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. Someone was throwing out a whole sack of these containers. I'm not sure how it will stand up to the elements, but I thought I would do some experimenting. By submerging the container underwater for several minutes, I proved it was waterproof... as long as the lid is replaced tightly, so please do that. The second part of the experiment is putting some out in the wild... we'll see how they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************************* CARBON *************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Number: 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Carbon exists free in nature and has been known since prehistoric time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Latin carbo, German Kohlenstoff, French carbone: coal or charcoal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Carbon is found free in nature in three allotropic forms: amorphous (lampblack, boneblack), graphite, and diamond. A fourth form, 'white' carbon, is thought to exist. Diamond is one of the hardest substances, with a high melting point and index of refraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Carbon forms numerous and varied compounds with limitless applications. Many thousands of carbon compounds are integral to life processes. Diamond is prized as a gemstone and is used for cutting, drilling, and as bearings. Graphite is used as a crucible for melting metals, in pencils, for rust protection, for lubrication, and as a moderator for slowing neutrons for atomic fission. Amorphous carbon is used for removing tastes and odors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

Since we had another school to go to we didn't even think twice about trying to get them. After visiting both schools, grabbing dinner, and getting a cache for my daily streak we went home. A few minutes later mr_ewok mentioned that only one of the two new caches had been logged. Hmmm...did someone get theother just didn't get to log it yet? We decided to go out and find it with the the thought that it was probably FTF'd already.

The drive out here was pleasant. Mr_ewok and I pull into the parking area walked over and I had it in hand within seconds. The muggle traffic was barely there since it was 8:30 p.m. We were very surprised that the log was clean, especially since it has been 4-1/2 hours since publishing. Nice little lesson on Carbon.

subdivision a short walk along a paved sidewalk and mowed grass
from parking (N 41° 11.629, W 096° 3.301). Watch your step as you
approach, there is a small drainage ditch near the cache location.
The park is closed from 10pm to 6am.

As with any cache, make sure the lid is sealed tightly and rehide
the container as you found it. Please use stealth to conceal the
location from muggles. I suggest that you take the cache to the
nearby park bench or picnic shelter while you sign the log so as
not to draw any unwanted attention to the cache hiding spot. There
is playground equipment nearby, so bring the geokids to help
distract the muggles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a replacement hide for &quot;Turtle Creek Hidey Hole&quot; (GC21PVZ).
When the tree with the Hidey Hole was cut down, I couldn't find a
similar location to replace the cache. As such, I decided to
archive the Hidey Hole and create a new hide instead. Hope you
enjoy the search...</groundspeak:long_description>

There is play equipment for the kids, so bring them along to distract the muggles. The park is closed from 10pm to 6am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find a camouflaged pill bottle sized container at the posted coordinates. This is not the cache and it does NOT contain a log. You will have to figure out what to do from there. DO NOT remove this container for any reason, please. You may want to take it to your car while you work out your game plan, but replace it before you start the hunt. Please do not include any spoilers in your log. Best of luck and happy hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

Mr_ewok had a half day of work and when he got home in the early afternoon we headed out for a cache. We arrived at the parking lot and he sat while I ran out to grab the container from stage one. Figured out right away what we needed to do. Nice brisk walk in the winter wonderland. After a few unsuccessful searches due to the snow we were able to get it. Yay...fun cache to do in any weather! Well, maybe not rainy weather. TFTC

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is placed in Wildewood Park, a great Ralston Park with a nice walking path. The cache is a 625 foot stroll through the park from the parking lot (N 41° 11.832 W 096° 02.036). If you take the most direct route from here you will end up on the wrong side of the creek. Instead, follow the sidewalk east from the parking lot crossing the creek on the sidewalk adjacent to 78th St and then a short walk on mowed grass. The last 160 feet into the trees will be more challenging terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a screw top container with room for trades, travel bugs and coins. During the warmer months, the cache hiding place can be quite overgrown, including the possibility of poisonous plants, so long pants are recommended. The mosquitos will be happy to see you as well. The terrain once you step into the woods can be very uneven, so step with caution. As with any cache, please use stealth when necessary and rehide the container where you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

I park at the park and walk around to get to the right side of the creek. Yowzah it is COLD! Found the cache but my fingers were frozen so I had a tough time opening it, signing the log, and dropping a trackable in it.

Okay, I gotta change my plans again! Too cold to grab all three so as I walked back toward my van I thought I was done. Heehee!! TFTC

During the warmer months, the cache hiding place can be rather overgrown, so you may want to wear long pants. There will be muggles about during baseball months, but if you use stealth, you should be able to slip into the trees without much notice.

Since she had already got this one I zoomed here to grab it before I had to meet her at Smith Park. Easy find even with all the new spring growth.

Rogue's mutant power first manifested in her early teens when she kissed Cody Robbins. Her mind filled with his memories, and he fell into a permanent coma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually realizing she could never safely live among normal people, Rogue began participating in her foster mother's criminal endeavors and came to join Mystique's terrorist Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. On her first mission, the inexperienced Rogue clashed with Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) and permanently absorbed the hero's memories and powers, including super-strength and flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distraught over her lack of control, Rogue turned to her enemies, the X-Men. Convinced of her sincerity, Professor Xavier accepted her onto the team; however, it wasn't until Rogue risked her own life to save Wolverine's fiancée Mariko Yashida that she began to gain her teammates' trust.&lt;br/&gt;Stay tuned for more, true believers...</groundspeak:long_description>

I didn't have any plan on where I was going or what caches I would do. I just picked a starting point and from there it was up to the gps.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is placed in Koch Park, a small park in old downtown
Ralston. You can park on 75th street just 40 feet from the cache.
Hopefully it will be a quick park and grab for you. The park is
closed from 10pm to 6am.

I don't like hiding micros, but to continue the Ralston Park
series, it will be necessary in these smaller, well manicured
parks. You are looking for a camouflaged bison tube. I came here
four times to take coordinates, and haven't run into a muggle in
the park yet, but be aware of your surroundings. There are nearby
houses, the Ralston Police Department across the park to the east,
and traffic on Main Street to deal with, so please use stealth. I
suggest sitting down on the park benches to sign the log, so you
don't draw any unwanted attention to your activities or the cache
hiding spot. Please be respectful of the landscaping and be sure to
close the container tightly. If you come when there is snow, make
extra tracks so you don't lead muggles to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am pretty confident in the coordinates, but I want this to be an
easy one... so if your GPSr doesn't have you right at the cache,
please send me your coordinates. Also, I think this one should be
handicap accessible. Let me know if you disagree.</groundspeak:long_description>

We had thought it would be a quick and easy find but it took us a good five minutes to find. Also where we found the cache it was not a one star terrain rating. Dunno if it was supposed to be there or if it was moved by someone. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Quick park and grab in a small parking lot near Oak Park in Ralston... not quite the same as some others in the series, but should be a very easy one. You can park just a few feet from ground zero. There are often muggles about, so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab. Bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. The experiment continues... first, the container was proven to be waterproof as long as you replace the lid tightly (please do). Second, they seem to be holding up in the elements, at least for the short term. Next experiment is internal log construction... trying a more secure method of attaching the log to the lid to ensure quick and simple log extraction and to reduce maintenance issues. Let me know if you have any comments/annoyances with these containers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************************* HYDROGEN *************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Cavendish, 1766. Hydrogen was prepared for many years before it was recognized as a distinct element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Greek: hydro, water; genes, forming Named by Lavoisier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The heavier elements were made from hydrogen or from other elements that were made from hydrogen. Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, combustible gas. Hydrogen gas is so light and diffusive that uncombined hydrogen can escape from the atmosphere. Hydrogen gas ordinarily is a mixture of two molecular forms, ortho- and para-hydrogen, which differ by the spins of their electrons and nuclei. Normal hydrogen at room temperature consists of 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form. The ortho form cannot be prepared in the pure state. Since the two forms of hydrogen differ in energy, their physical properties also differ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Hydrogen is important in the proton-proton reaction and carbon-nitrogen cycle. Liquid hydrogen is used in cryogenics and in the study of superconductivity. Great quantities are used for the fixation of nitrogen from the air in the Haber ammonia process. Hydrogen is use in welding, for the hydrogenation of fats and oils, in methanol production, in hydrodealkylation, hydrocracking, and hydrodesulfurization. Other applications include producing rocket fuel, filling balloons, making fuel cells, producing hydrochloric acid, and reducing metallic ores. Deuterium is used as a moderator to slow down neutrons and as a tracer. Tritium is used in the production of the hydrogen (fusion) bomb. Tritium is also used in making luminous paints and as a tracer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: Hydrogen occurs in the free state in volcanic gases and some natural gases. Hydrogen is prepared by steam on heated carbon, decomposition of certain hydrocarbons with heat, action of sodium or potassium hydroxide on aluminum electrolysis of water, or displacement from acids by certain metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Hydrogen Facts: While about 75% of the universe's elemental mass is hydrogen, hydrogen is relatively rare on Earth. The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium, which has one proton, but no neutrons. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. It was associated with the famous explosion of the Hindenburg airship and is used as a fuel by the space shuttle main engine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

Locals keep saying that a couple winters ago by this point of winter there was snow drifts 5 feet high. Glad that wasn't our first Nebraska winter!

Parked and walked out of my van and boom I spot it off the bat. Still an easy find and the same familiar container. Thanks Darick for the chemistry lesson and my smiley for the day!

Muggles are here, there and everywhere at times, so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab. Bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. Someone was throwing out a whole sack of these containers. I'm not sure how it will stand up to the elements, but I thought I would do some experimenting. By submerging the container underwater for several minutes, I proved it was waterproof... as long as the lid is replaced tightly, so please do that. The second part of the experiment is putting some out in the wild... we'll see how they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************************* BORON *************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Number: 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Sir H. Davy, J.L. Gay-Lussac, L.J. Thenard - 1808 (England/France)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Arabic Buraq; Persian Burah. These are the Arabic and Persian words for borax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: The melting point of boron is 2079°C, its boiling/sublimation point is at 2550°C, the specific gravity of crystalline boron is 2.34, the specific gravity of the amorphous form is 2.37, and its valence is 3. Boron has interesting optical properties. The boron mineral ulexite exhibits natural fiberoptic properties. Elemental boron transmits portions of infrared light. At room temperature, it is a poor electrical conductor, but it is a good conductor at high temperatures. Boron is capable of forming stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Boron filaments have high strength, yet are lightweight. The energy band gap of elemental boron is 1.50 to 1.56 eV, which is higher than that of silicon or germanium. Although elemental boron is not considered to be a poison, assimilation of boron compounds has a cumulative toxic effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Boron compounds are being evaluated for treating arthritis. Boron compounds are used to produce borosilicate glass. Boron nitride is extremely hard, behaves as an electrical insulator, yet conducts heat, and has lubricating properties similar to graphite. Amorphous boron provides a green color in pyrotechnic devices. Boron compounds, such as borax and boric acid, have many uses. Boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, to detect neutrons, and as a shield for nuclear radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is an 850 foot stroll through&lt;br/&gt;the park from the parking lot (N 41°12.337 W 96°02.225) or 475 feet&lt;br/&gt;from street parking (N 41°12.425 W 96°01.993). The park is closed&lt;br/&gt;from 10pm to 6am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a lock-n-lock container with room for trades, travel&lt;br/&gt;bugs and coins. During the warmer months, the cache hiding place&lt;br/&gt;can be quite overgrown, including the dreaded stinging nettles, so&lt;br/&gt;long pants are recommended. The mosquitos will be happy to see you&lt;br/&gt;as well. As with any cache, please use stealth when necessary and&lt;br/&gt;rehide the container well (use some barkouflage).</groundspeak:long_description>

With the extremely mild winter mornings I've been having the urge to cache several per day instead of my one. I loved the brisk stroll down to the cache. I must've angered the squirrel family because they kept chittering at me. I understnad when I'm being scolded so I picked up my pace to get out of their territory so they could settle down. I saw the cache from 20  feet. After I signed the log and looked at the swag I made sure the container wasn't visible using natural camo. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

The park is closed from 10pm&lt;br/&gt;to 6am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't like hiding micros, but to continue the Ralston Park&lt;br/&gt;series, it will be necessary in these smaller, well manicured&lt;br/&gt;parks. You are looking for a camouflaged tube, which could probably&lt;br/&gt;qualify as a smallish small, but bring your own pencil... I left it&lt;br/&gt;out in case you have something very small to trade. There is play&lt;br/&gt;equipment and a picnic shelter, so bring the GeoKids to distract&lt;br/&gt;the muggles. Be sure to close the container tightly. If you come&lt;br/&gt;when there is snow, make extra tracks so you don't lead muggles to&lt;br/&gt;the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Quick park and grab along Mockingbird Drive near 90th St. You can park on the street just a few feet from ground zero. Muggles drive by here frequently... so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab. Bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. The experiment continues... first, the container was proven to be waterproof as long as you replace the lid tightly (please do). Second, they seem to be holding up in the elements, at least for the short term. Next experiment is internal log construction... trying a more secure method of attaching the log to the lid to ensure quick and simple log extraction and to reduce maintenance issues. Let me know if you have any comments/annoyances with these containers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************************* MAGNESIUM *************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Number: 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: Mg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Recognized as an element by Black 1775; Isolated by Sir Humphrey Davy 1808 (England)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Magnesia, a district in Thessaly, Greece&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Magnesium has a melting point of 648.8°C, boiling point of 1090°C, specific gravity of 1.738 (20°C), and valence of 2. Magnesium metal is light (one-third lighter than aluminum), silvery-white, and relatively tough. The metal tarnishes slightly in air. Finely divided magnesium ignites upon heating in air, burning with a bright white flame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Magnesium is used in pyrotechnic and incendiary devices. It is alloyed with other metals to make them lighter and more easily welded, with applications in the aerospace industry. Magnesium is added to many propellants. It is used as a reducing agent in the preparation of uranium and other metals that are purified from their salts. Magnesite is used in refactories. Magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia), sulfate (Epsom salts), chloride, and citrate are used in medicine. Organic magnesium compounds have many uses. Magnesium is essential for plant and animal nutrition. Chlorophyll is a magnesium-centered porphyrin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: Magnesium is the 8th most abundant element in the earth's crust. While it is not found free it nature, it is available in minerals including magnesite and dolomite. The metal may be obtained by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride derived from brines and seawater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

For such a big park there are few good hiding spots, and turnover here has been high, but maybe this will last at least a while.</groundspeak:long_description>

Out over my lunch hour to get a couple of new caches. I hoped the cool damp weather would keep muggles out of the park today and I wasn't disappointed. Parked about 250ft from ground zero and made the short walk. iPhone led me to the hiding spot... didn't see it right away, lots of places it could be. Decided to bushwhack my way in as the cache description eludes to and made a quick find. TB must have been taken by the ladies last night... STF honors go to me. Thanks for the quick park, walk and grab today!

She found the container and retrieved it, signed it and while replacing she dropped it! It was so funny as she struggled to retrieve it. In the end it was placed back and we went on our wee merry way. TFTC&amp;FTF Oh, and I took the TB to move.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is placed in an unusual park in the Mockingbird area about 910 feet from a small parking lot (N 41°12.582, W 096°3.059). The terrain near the cache is very uneven and may be quite overgrown during the warmer months, including the possibility of bothersome plants. In the case of this hide, the shortest path to the cache is probably not the best way. Uneven ground and long dropoffs into a stream would make night caching hazardous and not recommended. The park is closed from 11pm to 5am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a screw-top container with room for trades, travel bugs and coins. As with any cache, make sure the container is well sealed and rehide the container well. Use stealth when necessary to conceal the location from muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the usual log, writing tool, and trinkets, the cache also originally contains a First To Find prize. It is a trackable Micro Compass Rose tag with an activation code so you can activate it and send it out as your own trackable.</groundspeak:long_description>

I walked up the inside of the giant and was thinking about taking photos because I enjoyed him so much. I hear some rustling and thought it was squirrels since they seem to scold me a lot. But, then the rustling was louder and from something large so I made my way as fast as I could to my van! From the safety of being near my vehicle I noticed that it was a cacher so I went back to say hello. It was nice to meet KMW75. TFTC

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is placed in an unusual park in Mockingbird Hills about
600 feet from street parking on Mockingbird Drive (N 41°12.625, W
096°3.300). DO NOT try to access this cache from &quot;L&quot; Street. The
terrain on the way to the cache is fairly easy to navigate, but
don't meander too far off the geotrail. Uneven ground and long
drop-offs into a stream would make night caching hazardous and not
recommended. If you are vertically challenged, you may need someone
along to give you a boost.

The cache is a large screw top container with plenty of room for
trades, travel bugs and coins. As with any cache, make sure the
container lid is well tightened and re-camouflage the container
well. Use stealth when necessary to conceal the location from
muggles. The park is closed from 11pm to 5am.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check out the stream this cache is hidden near on Google Maps. It
flows under &quot;L&quot; street east of this cache and meanders through
Mockingbird, disappearing as suddenly as it appeared. Pretty deep
ravine and wide stream to hide, but somehow, they did it. I wonder
where it goes from here?</groundspeak:long_description>

FTF!!! Was nearby when this one published... debated about whether I wanted to run out and try for this one for a moment and then decided to go for it. Could see on the map that this would probably be a very easy find, and had the cache in hand within 9 minutes of getting the notification. Opened the container (hey that looks familiar) and peeked at the log... yup, first. Thanks for the quick park and grab, da_ewoks, and for the FTF!

Black boxes on airplanes are painted orange so that they are more visible to the human eye. If you dream of the color orange it means that there will be an unexpected change in your life. Orange is a stimulant for the healing process. It helps broaden the mind and deal with life issues and career. Orange has the optical illusion of bringing objects into the foreground. Orange blossoms have been used as symbols of love.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">orn on Yancy Street in New York City's Lower East Side, to a Jewish family, Benjamin Jacob Grimm had an early life that was one of poverty and hardship, shaping young Grimm into a tough, streetwise scrapper. His older brother Daniel, whom Ben idolized, was killed in a street gang fight when Ben was eight years old. Following the death of his parents, Ben was raised by his Uncle Jake. He comes to lead the Yancy Street gang at one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Excelling in football as a high school student, Ben received a full scholarship to Empire State University, where he first meets his eventual life-long friend in a teenaged genius named Reed Richards, as well as future enemy Victor von Doom. Despite them being from radically different backgrounds, science student Richards described his dream to Grimm to one day build a space rocket to explore the regions of space around Mars, and Grimm jokingly agrees to fly that rocket when the day comes. Reed had begun to build his starship and asked his old friend Ben to be its pilot. When the government abruptly cut off their funding, Reed asked Ben to help him make an unauthorized test flight before the project could be shut down. Ben feared that the ship might not be adequately shielded against cosmic radiation; but Reed's girlfriend Sue Storm -to whom Ben was somewhat attracted-played on Ben's machismo and he acquiesced. Joined by Sue and her kid brother Johnny Storm, they successfully launched the ship into space, but cosmic rays penetrated their shielding and forced them to crash-land back on Earth. The radiation had mutated them into superhuman beings-unluckily for Grimm, who transformed into the grotesque, scaly-hided strongman dubbed the Thing. The quartet decided to use their powers for the betterment of humanity as the Fantastic Four. First to find prize is a Marvel Mystery Eraser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stay tuned for more, true believers...</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">06/21/2012 11:31:00 AM - Today monty12 and I made a plan to cache for a few hours. A couple days ago I ran into her at the newest OPL, she talked me into finding Rain Rain Go Away (I've drive by it many times but chickened out because of traffic muggles). Well, I get there and had to flip a U-ee and when I pulled off the road next to the guardrail on the correct side making sure I avoided the cinder block on the ground. My van slams down and crunches and jumps back up. What the heck?! I know I was careful to miss the block. I make sure I'm totally off the road and I get out and look. A huge deep mud puddle is what my van had sunk in and whacked my bumper out and split it underneath. Well, that makes me pretty angry so I just left. This cache is not meant to be found by me! Today monty12 offers to drive me there so I can redeem myself. I take her up on it and made the easy find. Thank goodness I'm done with this one!

The rest of the day didn't go so well for us. In four hours we only found four caches! While looking for Looking Down a Rusty Barrel we got a new cache text so we abandon that search to go find the new one. Made the Co-FTF find there with darick and johnablick. Stood there talking for a good amount of time. Then we parted ways and grabbed some Taco Bell. Went to Storm (Oroco) and searched and searched there. Really?! I don't know why monty12 and I were struggling so badly with finding these darn caches. We eventually find it with a hint from a PaF. Just in time too because I need to get back to my van and go round up my mini ewok.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While attending Columbia, Reed met the much younger Sue Storm, his landlady's niece, who was instantly smitten with him. Reed received her interest awkwardly at first, but they later dated steadily during Sue's own college years; Reed also befriended Sue's kid brother, Johnny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the huge energy-absorbing alien Gormuu sought to conquer Earth, Reed outwitted and destroyed the entity. Partly in response to this incident, government funding for Reed's starship project was cut.After the Gormuu incident, Reed was more determined than ever to further the advance of space technology, and he convinced a reluctant Ben to help him make a test flight before their project could be shut down. Sue and Johnny Storm insisted on sharing the risk with them and came along for the ride. The quartet successfully launched into space, but intense cosmic rays penetrated the ship's shielding and irradiated the crew, forcing them back to Earth. Once there, the quartet discovered that the cosmic rays had mutated them into superhumans, with Reed gaining stretching powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a conflict during which he mercifully spared the life of the planet-eater Galactus, Reed found himself placed on trial in an interstellar court by survivors of the many worlds Galactus had consumed; but Reed was exonerated once the last-minute testimony of Eternity proved to the court that Galactus was a necessary aspect of the cosmos. On the family front, Sue's second child was stillborn despite Reed's frantic efforts to save their unborn baby; Reed discovered that his own long-lost father Nathaniel was living a new life with a new family on Other Earth; and an embittered Thing quit the Fantastic Four.Seeking a more normal family life again, Reed and Sue retired from the FF altogether to concentrate on raising Franklin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the New Warriors' actions during a taping of their reality TV show caused the deaths of hundreds of innocent people and children, Tony Stark took the lead in a Superhero Registration initiative and Reed joined him, eager to put his scientific abilities to use in the capture and imprisonment of unregistered heroes. This created a rift between Reed and Sue.Sue soon left and joined the anti-Registration side, led by their mutual friend, Captain America. In the meantime, Reed designed a prison within the Negative Zone to hold the super-powered captives, but the anti-Registration forces quickly broke into the prison and released their allies, eventually bringing the fight into downtown New York. During the fight, Sue retailed against the Taskmaster when he attacked Reed. But Captain America soon withdrew when he saw the damage done by his fight and turned himself in to the authorities. Despite finding himself on the winning side, Reed has been left to put back together the pieces of a family and a team that each joined against him before surrendering to the law.&lt;br/&gt;stay tuned for more true believers...</groundspeak:long_description>

After a nice Sunday morning breakfast, the GeoFamily was in the area and I convinced GuitarMan24 to join me to find this one. We parked on the opposite side from this one and waited out a muggle... down the hill and back up. GM24 quickly narrowed in on the location and found the cache in the second place he looked. He signed for us both and we headed back to the car... nice park and grab for us today, thanks jgstratton!

Was closing in on two hours of unplanned caching and getting a little hungry, but when iowa2asia and I cache together, we always talk about how nice it is to get a &quot;baker's dozen&quot;. Since I was sitting on a dozen finds, I decided to stop here for just one more. Parked a short walk away and enjoyed the rather brisk Saturday morning breeze on my way to ground zero. When I saw the hiding spot, I was expecting a much smaller container, but was pleasantly surprised to put my hand on a rather larger container. Nobody around, so I was able to sign the log and put this one back unhindered by muggles today. Thanks for some nice hides today, WBs, including my last of the day to complete a baker's dozen :)

Got a handful of caches and even grabbed a new puzzle from The WBs that I didn't pick up yet. After I found Do You Twitter I headed over to lunch.

During lunch a group of us decided to find TeamDAAKs new cache off the Papio trail. After a short search under the COs scrutiny (he was parked across the creek watching us!) Bill the Bear found it. As we stood around talking a few of the ladies decided to go get a cupcake. We had a fun time eating our sugary treat and talking story. After that we all went in different directions, but shadow chasers and I went to Wilco World #1 and she braved the muggly street to make the find. I sat in my car like the chicken I am. Thanks Shadow chasers for helping me out!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> Ororo Munroe is born in New York City as the child of Kenyan tribal princess N’Dare and American photographer David Munroe. When Ororo is six months old, she and her parents move to the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Five years later, during the Suez Crisis, a fighter jet crashes into her parents’ house, killing them. Buried under tons of rubble, Ororo survives but is orphaned and left with intense claustrophobia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homeless and orphaned, Ororo was found by a gang of street urchins who took her to their master, Achmed el-Gibar. Achmed trained Ororo in the arts of thievery and she soon became his prize pupil, excelling in picking both pockets and locks. During her time in Cairo, Ororo picked the pocket of an American tourist. The man proved no easy mark, however, as he was Charles Xavier, a powerful mutant telepath who used his abilities to stop the theft. At that moment, Xavier was psionically attacked by another mutant and Ororo used the opportunity to escape.Her mutant ability to psionically control the weather emerged soon after, and she was able to use them to rescue T'Challa, a prince of the African nation of Wakanda, from his would-be kidnappers. Stay tuned for more, true believers... </groundspeak:long_description>

A couple days ago I ran into her at the newest OPL, she talked me into finding Rain Rain Go Away (I've drive by it many times but chickened out because of traffic muggles). Well, I get there and had to flip a U-ee and when I pulled off the road next to the guardrail on the correct side making sure I avoided the cinder block on the ground. My van slams down and crunches and jumps back up. What the heck?! I know I was careful to miss the block. I make sure I'm totally off the road and I get out and look. A huge deep mud puddle is what my van had sunk in and whacked my bumper out and split it underneath. Well, that makes me pretty angry so I just left. This cache is not meant to be found by me! Today monty12 offers to drive me there so I can redeem myself. I take her up on it and made the easy find. Thank goodness I'm done with this one!

The rest of the day didn't go so well for us. In four hours we only found four caches! While looking for Looking Down a Rusty Barrel we got a new cache text so we abandon that search to go find the new one. Made the Co-FTF find there with darick and johnablick. Stood there talking for a good amount of time. Then we parted ways and grabbed some Taco Bell. Went to Storm (Oroco) and searched and searched there. Really?! I don't know why monty12 and I were struggling so badly with finding these darn caches. We eventually find it with a hint from a PaF. Just in time too because I need to get back to my van and go round up my mini ewok.

Last of the day today... GuitarMan24 got a few that I had already found and ended the day with 26, I with 23 smileys to add to my total. We needed to stop by the local establishment to pick up some chicken for dinner, so this made a perfect ending spot. Had to wait for a muggle sitting in his car near ground zero, but he cleared out after a couple of minutes so we could swoop in for the quick park and grab. Nice little clear container that nobody would mistake for a bomb or anything dangerous... good choice for this location. What was the container before it was a geocache? Thanks for the quick find to end our day, WBs!

Since the weather gave us a break from the heat, GuitarMan24 and I decided to head out for an afternoon of caching. Thought we'd start with some easy ones and this fit the bill. Quick park and grab and not even any muggles to avoid today. Signed and moved on... thanks for the quick find to get us started. Ended up with 23 today including my 1500th find :)

Had some time in the area today after GeoKid#4's volleyball game. Was able to pull up almost right next to this one with nobody around. Enjoyed the object at ground zero, but I misunderstood the description and started searching for something larger. Didn't take me long to realize my mistake and make the find, though there was no log in the container and had me second guessing again if I found the right thing. Now reading gatefan's log and some others before him, I now know that I for sure made the find here. I added a bit of a log from a scrap of paper in the car, should accommodate the next several finders, perhaps even a dozen. Cool spot and a nice hide, thanks WBs!

Seeing a few DNFs on this one, I typed a text to the cache owner as GuitarMan24 drove over here in case I needed help. I was happy to find a very reasonable object to search at ground zero and put my finger right on this one, so no phone a friend was needed. Unless someone was unfamiliar with this container, I would think it would be a quick park and grab like it was for us today. Thanks for another smiley to add to our list today, da_ewoks!

Had some time in the area today after GeoKid#4's volleyball game. Pulled up on a side street and made the short walk to this one. Super quick find in a cool spot... sat down to sign the log and took a picture of the artwork on my way out. I am happy to say I was acquainted with the CO in his former life when he was a music director, and an awesome one too. Nice find to add to my adventure today, thanks WBs!

GuitarMan24 parked us on the side street and we made our way down the path to this one. After several minutes looking for this one, I went to the logs to see if there was any help. The only thing we saw that helped a bit was that the coordinates were good, so I re-concentrated my search were the GPSr zeroed out. Adjusted my position trying to think like a cache owner and spotted the well camouflaged hide. Always makes you feel good when you can turn a tough hide into a fairly quick find with good geosenses. Thanks for bringing us here for a smiley today WBs!

The first cache I tried to find was Green Wal #3 but the soda pop dilvery muggle was parked in front of GZ and he was sitting in his truck. I pulled into the parking hoping to wait him out but he wasn't budging so I moved to the next target cache a multi in Hillborough which also was thwarted by a family of muggles. I also tried to sit them out but in the end I left. Boy my caching day hasn't been very successful so far.

On to BIBB#5 I looked at both objects and didn't see anything off the bat. Then a juggle (jogger muggle) ran by and Nia the border collie went crazy. I calmed her down and went back to my search. Nothing! Okay, time to use paf and in seconds after his hint I had it in hand. Phew.

The next couple caches was easy peasy. Then I decided to go to Deja Vu. Took a little bit of searching but I found it. It was wet with some water inside but the ziplock protected the log pretty well. Then on my way back home I stopped back at the first cache I tried and was able to make the grab.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This BIBB is in honor of a notable Omahan you may be unaware of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ann Ronell, born in Omaha as Ann Rosenblatt, was a songwriter who wrote or co-wrote two extremely popular songs from the mid-20th century: &lt;strong&gt;Willow Weep for Me&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Willow Weep for Me&lt;/strong&gt; is now considered a jazz standard, with well over 800 different versions being recorded, including a pop hit version from 1964 by Chad and Jeremy. In 1932, when she wrote the song, her boyfriend was the incomparable composer and songwriter George Gershwin, so fairly or not, it has been rumored for 80 years about how much help she may have had in composing the song.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frank Churchill wrote &lt;strong&gt;Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&lt;/strong&gt; for the phenomenally popular Disney cartoon &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Little Pigs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Ann Ronell was working for Disney at the time and is credited with &quot;additional lyrics.&quot;  While it might be said that anyone who has ever heard the song has inevitably added &quot;additional lyrics&quot; while trying to remove the impossibly catchy earworm from their brains (&lt;em&gt;the words practically write themselves -- go ahead, try it!&lt;/em&gt;), she does get official credit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ann Ronell had a lifetime of career music credits, but is by far best known for these two hits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There will be some bushwhacking from the Westin Hills Nature Habitat trail. There have been caches back here in the past, I believe, so some of you may be returning to familiar territory.</groundspeak:long_description>

You’re looking for a small circular lock &amp; lock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This strangely shaped, public, county-owned 2.78 acres is undeveloped, and likely to remain so. What looks at first glance to be a vacant lot was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive you’ll find some remnants of Old Military Road, but you’re really walking along the Overland Trail. Captain Edward Beckwith, US Army, was responsible for creating Military Road in 1857. What was designed to be a military supply road was also used by many travelers to the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ruts and furrows in the land tracing through the entire plot of set-aside land have been identified and preserved as evidence of wagon train and stagecoach use from the 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online you can read the entire application the Nebraska State Historical Society made to the Department of the Interior for historic designation. Old survey maps and historical information may be found there. From the document:&lt;br/&gt;Even though the history of these particular ruts cannot be traced with precision, there is no doubt they are part of the old Military Road that originally went from Omaha to Fort Kearny. As such, they are eligible at the state level under Criterion A for their association with the military and westward expansion. The establishment of this road also helped ensure that Omaha continued as an important freighting station and a jumping-off point for travellers going west. Finally, these ruts are an incredibly rare resource given their location in a highly developed urban area.</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a &quot;decon&quot; container with a log and small trade items, room enough for small Travel Bugs or GeoCoins. Sign the logsheet and return the cache to its original spot.&lt;br/&gt;This Cache replaces the one previously hidden by Dr. Horrible, but isn't as creatively placed, so you should have no problems finding it.&lt;br/&gt;Upon reaching the coordinates, you should read the plaque that notes the spot that Nebraska had its first aeroplane flight. It occurred on November 21, 1910 and the flight was piloted by Charles Baysdorfer..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the neat things about this location is that you can almost imagine the history that took place here, since the area hasn't changed too terribly much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed by a Nebraskache Member</groundspeak:long_description>

Mr_ewok decided to stay home and take a rest day. I was eager to get some real caching done (not just one a day). Got to TANZ!!'s house and jumped his geomobile (long story but we used mr_ewok's handy dandy portable jump start and had it purring on the first crank). Loaded up Nia the border collie and our caching stuff and hit the road.

We had decided on trying to cache our way up to Fremont. When we hit the Elkhorn area we started looking for ones that we needed. We didn't make it up to Fremont but we did get close. 19 smileys and 2 DNFs a pretty good day in all.

At the breakfast we picked up another cacher, hwbas04, to tag along with us. We first hit the west side and then attacked the east. After that hwbas04 decided to head out and TANZ!! and I went to the south side of the lake. Nia loved walking all around with purpose (her backpack). Toward the end she was getting tired and would plop down any chance she got! A nice beautiful day at the lake with a nice breeze to cool us.

I was trying to reuse the container Ladycache distributed at a recent CITO in a creative way; I'm sure this must have been done before, but I haven't seen it. I hope the log doesn't get wet! Please put things back together as you found them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little extra D/T rating just because this part of the park takes more effort to get to. No matter where you (legally) park, this is a walk in the woods, not a park and grab. Since I was trying to find all the Cunningham caches I've been neglecting, I thought I'd do my part and hide a few as well. Keep in mind you share these trails with as many horses as people, and step accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addendum: Now that I've had a chance to look it up, there have been variations on this theme before. Just goes to show all us geocachers end up thinking alike eventually, I guess.</groundspeak:long_description>

The CO texted me and gave me the okay to be a little rough with it. After trying for 15 mins and semi ruining the container I gave up and moved on. The CO did say he'd come out and take a look at it since he was gonna be in the area. I left a note to mark me finding it. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

As I got back to my car and was driving out the CO (who I texted with earlier) was just driving in. We stopped and chatted for a little bit and then I let him get on with his day and I had to get back home to meet mr_ewok for lunch. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      Container has a micro log, but could handle small trackables like coins. The container is magnetically constructed and may be opened by lifting the bug's shell. No spoiler container photos, please. I may have to bring a winter coat out for this cache when the snow flies.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy searching for a small container near an interesting
building that is not actually part of the University of South
Dakota. This building is open 24 hours during the school year for
studying or socializing, why not take a tour while you're here? The
cache container had gone missing, but has been replaced with one a
bit smaller which contains only a log sheet &lt;i&gt;BYOP&lt;/i&gt; (bring your
own pen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The cache is not in the building, but you are welcome to a
tour while you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy finding this cache!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This is Day 8 out of 8 of caching our way from Springfield, MO, to Montana, to Minnesota for a cousins weddings, and then back home to Springfield. 4,100 miles in total. On the way home with the goal of grabbing the oldest caches in Nebraska and Missouri! I pulled over by the gas station because after caching in Souix Falls, i was a little tired, so i slept here for the night and tired to get some shut eye. i was sleeping off and on, and finally woke up as the sun was coming up, since i was no less than a .1 of a mile a way, i went for the easy park and grab. little cool this morning. tftc</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nero Wolfe, also known as the galloping gourmet, was an armchair detective. He rarely left the house; instead his assistant, Archie Goodwin,his assistant would collect the facts and report back. Nero Wolfe would probably not have taken on many cases had he not needed the clients’ money to pay for his two true passions: fine food and the collecting of orchids. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's male secretary, prodded him into taking cases whenever the bank balance got a little low. Wolfe, as a character, is difficult to like. He's a self-assured type that does nothing unless he wants to; making his assistant, Archie Goodwin, deal with the outside world. Airing 1943–1944, 30 minutes ABC; 1946 30 Minutes MBS; 1950–1951, 30 minutes NBC; and 1982 CBC radio and was created in 1934 by Rex Stout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk.

Philip Marlowe had no sympathy for the bad guys as you can tell from this opening statement he makes at the beginning of each episode: “Get this and get it straight. Crime is a sucker’s road, and those who travel it wind up in the gutter, the prison, or the grave.” Airing in 1947-1951 it ran on NBC from June of 1947 to August 1947 and then September 1948 till September 1951, with the main sponsor being Pepsodent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located.</groundspeak:long_description>

We had grabbed a cache in every county that we passed through, stopped at Grand Tetons, Yellowstone, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Scotts Bluff, Chimney Rock, spending a week in Seattle taking in the sites and visiting Groundspeak and also saw the original stash plaque. And on the way back seeing Devils Tower, Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse, and a portion of the Berlin Wall, Wounded Knee and the Badlands. The trip was great to take. Glad that your cache could have been apart of our journey! This was a nice park and grab. tftc

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 1949 to 1953 in radio Richard Diamond, played by David Meyer was one of the more laid back detectives, and a signing gumshoe. He started as OSS agent and then as a New York City private detective. His show would normally end with a serenade to his girlfriend Helen. During the program Detective Diamond would usually feel the butt of a gun and wake up with Lt. Levinson helping him with the case. The 30 minute show was aired weekly on NBC then to move to ABC in 1951 and CBS in 1953 and sponsored by Camel cigarettes when on ABC and Rexall on CBS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk. Be respectful of the area and remember to CITO.</groundspeak:long_description>

But sometimes the best history can be found in our own neighborhoods. The self-owned barbershop, the no name gas station, and then there is the corner pub. Where history is relived all over again with the reminiscing of a tale or two, where the truth meets the skeptical. This cache is located outside of one such pub where the Northenders have told many tales. The cache is placed with permission and should be a quick park and grab for many. There is no need to go inside for the cache and the muggles will enjoy trying to get another tale about strange people walking around in circles looking lost. &lt;br/&gt;TBG</groundspeak:long_description>

We would tune in the radio station just right, listen and watch whatever was playing on the big screen just across the way. &lt;br/&gt;The Starlite Drive-In started in the early 1950’s and closed in the late 80’s. It originally had a screen of 40’x60’, which blew down in 1967 and was replaced with a 50’x110’ screen and then a second screen was added in the early 1980’s. The site is now home to a trailer park, but the original marquee was saved and remains at the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located near the rear area of what used to be the back lot.

Sam along with Lurene Tuttle as Effie Perrine, his perfect secretary and John McIntire was Lt. Dundy. He meticulously made a report on every episode as the case progressed. During each episode Effie would find out what was developing with Sam. Wise cracking and upper cutting could be possible in each of the episodes. Running on CBS until 1950 when the creator was investigated for possible Communist Ties, such was the times during the McCarthy era.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how geocaching has the ability to enlighten you
about your surroundings. Mrs. Gecko being from around South Dakota
has lived in many of the small towns around Sioux Falls and the
state. But there is always new opportunity to learn about where one
lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the construction season a few years ago, we had to take
the back roads to and from work. In doing so we found the quaint
little town of Ellis. It is one of those towns that if you blink
you will have already passed through. This little town was founded
in 1893 as a grain town. The Ellis &amp; Eastern railroad is based
here; running for 14.5 miles to Valley Springs to the east on the
Minnesota border. Originally named Scoopville, due to the amount of
grain that was handled and shipped all had to be moved with
‘scoop shovels’, until the grain elevators were built.
At that time the grain company’s suggested the name change to
Ellis, after the grain manager for the firm Peavey and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bridge cache is located just on the outskirts of Ellis. The
terrain rating is due to the traffic driving by. I can be very busy
and fast and times so use caution when retreiving. Due to another
cache at a nearby location this cache had to be relocated. And
there is a slight pull off nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you drive through the area you can still see a lot of the
original structures that was Ellis. There is no room for a pen and
we like when the area remains pristine. So please remember to CITO
whenever possible. Happy Caching.&lt;br /&gt;

When I got it home, I realized that it was rather hideous and I had to make it go away...  I decided to make it the FTF prize at a really easy cache!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small container about the size of a small peanut butter jar.  It is very near a gravel road and you can pull right up and park next to the cache. (This is assuming you are south bound.  If not, there are places nearby to turn around.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location should be obvious when you get there.   It may not be winter friendly.  Please sign the log for credit.  Also, please replace the cache as you found it.  Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was named after a cache called &quot;Obvious&quot; in Lake Benton, MN.  The cache was in an obvious hole at the base of a tree.  It was also obviously an obvious place for lake visitors to stuff beer cans, so &quot;Obvious&quot; went away...  Enjoy this one!</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is a &quot;next door neighbor&quot; to &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot; (GC176KW).
Although they are neighbors, they are somewhat opposites. This
cache is &quot;Possible&quot;. The other one is... well... &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot;...

&lt;p&gt;Located just off the abandoned railroad tracks, the area may be
visible to muggles attending softball games, so use stealth as
required. One can park near the well worn path to &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot;
and take the tracks or access may be just as easy from the Brandon
Softball Complex. The terrain rating is slightly higher as the
result of the need to cross the abandoned railroad tracks and
because of some culverts in the area that may be hidden by tall
grass, so PLEASE watch your step!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You will need to bring your own writing instrument.  The cache is located near the entrance to a high voltage transmission substation between Brandon and Sioux Falls, but you cannot see the substation from the cache site.  The substation is operated by Western Area Power Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Energy. The area is gated, and the gate is normally locked, however there are times (usually during normal working hours) when the gate is open. In any case, the cacher should not and does not need to pass through the gate to reach the cache. There is plenty of room to park between the road and the gate. Permission to place this cache was granted by the supervisor for this substation.</groundspeak:long_description>

this cache you must use your noodle and locate each of the nine
caches listed below to solve the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1949 and running through 1962 with only a year
hiatus from 1954-1955. Johnny Dollar was the &quot;the insurance
investigator with the action-packed expense account.&quot; His
adventures as a freelance Insurance investigator took him all
around the world in search of the truth behind the clients of the
Hartford based Universal Adjustment Bureau, a clearinghouse for the
many insurance companies. Most of his cases were to stop fraud
associated with what would be discovered as murder. As he solved
his cases he would routinely give an amount for his expense report;
Taxi ride $2.58, or .10 for a long distance phone call, usually
back to the Adjustment Bureau. During its years on the radio,
Johnny was played by no more than 8 actors. Starting with Dick
Powell was in the original audition show, but left this role for
another detective role. Charles Russell played the role from
February 1949-January 1950. The last to play the role was Mandel
Kramer who played the role from June of 1961 to September 1962.
Although this radio show did have a TV pilot in 1962, it never made
it to the screen as a series and will only forever live on along
the airways of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate this cache Johnny provided numbers from his expense
report to help locate the final coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

Placed with the permission of the property owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes worlds can meet without the inhabitants of either realizing....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Natives, by Katherine MacLean&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old one said, &quot;Stick close by me, child.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What'll it be like, Grandpa?&quot; The youngster was frightened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Dark, very dark, and big. It moves fast, but we'll keep up with it.&quot; The tone was consciously reassuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Dark, Grandpa?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Yes, it sucks heat and absorbs light. You'll find out when you're old and strong enough to swim down to the bottom and see what's there. Now stay with me when we follow it, and don't get lost in the crowd; and don't get ahead of me or get too close to it--you might take in too much, and get overcharged.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What's 'overcharged,' Grandpa? Can you really get too much?&quot; The youngster jigged up and down a little with excitement and anticipation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a moment, the oldster turned his attention from watching for the thing that was coming, and considered him fondly. &quot;Poor youngling. I forget. You've had no chance to learn what it means to get enough. You're too young to ride the storms and tap the lightnings.... Listen now. When a grownup has to let out a flash of blue light, that means that he's overcharged and spinning off balance inside, and so he has to save himself by letting out his energy to let down the pressure. So be careful; take enough, but don't be greedy and take in too much too suddenly. Now let's just float here with the others and be ready.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a beautiful bright day. The sun poured down its flood of light, here and there energizing a molecule of the blue air into little sparkles of ionization; and below, a mist of bright clouds half veiled the darkness that was the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What's it mean when someone blinks blue light in lots of flashes, and then glows red and starts sinking, huh, Grandpa?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I'll tell you later when you're older. Just be careful and don't get too close.&quot; He was abruptly excited. &quot;Here it comes!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the blue translucence far below, a black dot appeared and grew rapidly, rushing closer until it was a huge fish-shaped object with widespread fins, rushing towards them. It would pass slightly to the left of them, and already the waiting crowd was moving to intercept it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It flashed by, and the youngster thought they were going to lose it--it was going so much faster than they; but as the thought crossed his mind, and he saw the two churning glowing openings in its rear, a burning blast of energy struck him. A multitude of glowing, charged particles crackled around him, streamed against him. His fields shifted to reach out and capture them; the spin of stored energy within spun faster, absorbing the new energy into its drive, its life-pulse rising to a deep hum, and he felt strong, stronger than he had ever felt before in his life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were flying faster now, accelerating faster than he had ever flown, and it was easy. They drew up closer to the dark thing, matching it speed for speed, laving in the glowing cloud of energy-particles that roared backward from its jets. The youngster was astounded and exhilarated at the tremendous, effortless speed with which they were driving forward. This was the first time he had ever had so much power. It was ten times more than any aurora borealis with its pale wash of energy waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drunken in his new found strength, he pulled ahead closer to the roaring jets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* * * * *&lt;br/&gt;At the peak of the arc of climb of the New York-Istanbul stratoliner, high in the ionosphere where the Earth was merely a giant globe far below, the pilot of the stratoliner boredly cut the jets for the fuel-saving glide that turned their nose toward Earth again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The radar was clanging its usual senseless warning of imminent collision with some solid objects, which had approached closer than the automatic relays considered safe. It had been clanging for several minutes. The pilot glanced in annoyance at the radar screen, where several hundred globes--from two to seven feet in diameter--showed vividly, trailing the ship in a fan-shaped cluster. &quot;Some day I'm going to take a hammer to that thing.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-pilot, looking back from the control blister's rear window, saw nothing, as usual, except a few of the shining globes, which showed themselves transiently in a brief flash of blue light as they carelessly overloaded and discharged--and one, smaller than the rest, who blinked on and off rapidly in brilliant flashes of blue. As he watched, it ran suddenly down the color-scale to red and began to lag behind, a glowing red globe, sinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &quot;I wonder what the hell they think they're doing?&quot; he grumbled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * * * * *&lt;br/&gt;*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE NATIVES ***&lt;br/&gt;The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Natives, by Katherine MacLean This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

On the way home from a family reunion in Lake Benton, MN with coupleofbucks, GuitarMan24 and GeoKids2&amp;3. While others got gas across the street, I followed the Garmin over here. By the time they caught up, I was making the find. Quick stop for us today and a nice hide, thanks EarthMatters!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">first there is a small pull off near the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standing on a winding road somewhere in West Virginia you see an innocent looking group of people. Walking down the middle of the road, just as you get use to this sight you hear the familiar call &quot;Bowling!&quot;. The next thing you see is a running person hurling what appears to be a small metal cannon ball being thrown down the road in a bowling ball fasion. As the object bounces it's way down the road, only coming to a sudden stop somewhere off in the ditch. You then hear a call in the distance &quot;Car!&quot; No, they do not stop traffic to do this sport. Irish Road bowling was born in, well you guessed it Ireland. It has since grown in popularity and has traveled to the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played with a 28 ounce iron and steel cannonball around the size of a tennis ball or croquet ball, the bowlers will attempt to get as few throws to the finish line which is apporoximatley a mile and a half over winding roads. The cache you are looking for will be a P&amp;G for most, but this road reminds me of many of my experiances bowling with our family in WV. Enjoy the cache, and if intereseted we can bowl sometime.</groundspeak:long_description>

Guess this one qualifies in the &quot;near&quot; category...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some call them evil.  Some call them a challenge.  In any case, they are small, and it could be tough to find them.  This one is was located in a rest area near Kadoka in western South Dakota, but it was a little too close to another established cache.  It is now located outside of Pipestone in western Minnesota.  It is still at a rest area, although someone removed the bathrooms about two years ago. There is still a well maintained picnic shelter there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a blinkie, you will need to bring a writing instrument.  As always, try to use stealth!  The log must be signed for credit.</groundspeak:long_description>
