The difficulty of 3 on this cache is for the height requirements. If you do not have at least a 6-foot reach (height plus length of arm), I would recommend that you bring something sturdy to stand on to reach the cache. I am probably over-exaggerating the difficulty, but better safe than sorry.

This is a microcache that has be camouflaged to fit into its surroundings! :) It is a log only, please BYOP!

The cache is hidden just on the outskirts of my retired in-laws property. Please park in the driveway as they roads are narrow and no room to pull off to the side. They are looking forward watching some of the cachers look for the cache, if they are at home. You are more than welcome to ring the door bell and introduce yourselves if you want -- they do not bite!.

Have fun and keep on caching!

Word to the wise: Because this cache will undoubtedly be wet, waterproof paper has been used. NO NEED TO DRY IT; PLEASE DO NOT REPLACE IT WITH REGULAR PAPER!! 

When I was in 8th grade, my parents selected a clarinet as my instrument of choice. I took a few lessons through school and then just practiced and learned on my own.
The three years I spent at Calvin, I was in the band - just squeaked in as last chair clarinet. The fun of that position was that when percussion occasionally needed assistance, I was the one called upon to help.

At that time my &quot;little&quot; brother needed a clarinet, so mine was given to him.

Over the years my first 5 kids selected other instruments. Finally the 6th one selected a clarinet and I discovered that I could still play it.

Have you ever played a clarinet? Here's your chance.

What do you know about a clarinet? Can you answer the following questions?

How many finger holes? Seven or is it Ten?
Does moisture collect inside? Yes
Does the moisture drain out? Yes
Are they usually black? Usually, but not here,mabey purple.

So how much water do you think it would take to fill a clarinet? Want to find out? Then try this cache.

A non-musical note - a huge thanks to Caveboy_Ken for the idea for this cache, and also a good TEXAS friend for handing me the container and makin me place it</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Steve McQueen&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Josh
Randall (Steve McQueen) was a man of few words. A bounty hunter by
trade, he tracked his prey all over the West. Randall carried an
1892 44/40 center fire Winchester carbine that he called &quot;Mare's
Laig.&quot; It handled like a revolver but had the punch of a rifle. 
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other bounty hunters, Randall had scruples. He tried to
bring the prisoner in alive and often found himself called upon to
protect people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1960 the character of Jason Nichols (Wright King) was added
to help Randall out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show made a star of Steve McQueen, who unlike many Western
stars, would go on to a memorable film career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: August 12, 2007&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Container changed to a drink canister, recycled from another cache.
Cache is located just east of Joe D. Cox who died on Groundhog Day.
Terrain rating upgraded due to some grade changes and thorns in the
area. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to 
KLCE FTF!&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For those that have not heard of him before: Marie Antoine Carême&lt;br/&gt;(8 June 1784–12 January 1833), known as &quot;The King of Chefs,&lt;br/&gt;and the Chef of Kings&quot; was an early practitioner and exponent of&lt;br/&gt;the elaborate style of cooking known as haute cuisine, the &quot;high&lt;br/&gt;art&quot; of French cooking: a grandiose style of cookery favored by&lt;br/&gt;both international royalty and by the newly rich of Paris. Carême&lt;br/&gt;is often considered as one of the first, internationally renowned&lt;br/&gt;celebrity chefs. Born in Paris and abandoned there by destitute&lt;br/&gt;parents in 1792 at the height of the French Revolution, he worked&lt;br/&gt;as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian chophouse in exchange for room&lt;br/&gt;and board. In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly,&lt;br/&gt;a famous pâtissier with a shop near the Palais-Royal. Bailly&lt;br/&gt;recognized his talent and ambition. By the time he was prepared to&lt;br/&gt;leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave&lt;br/&gt;his new employer when a better offer came along. He opened his&lt;br/&gt;shop, the Pâtisserie de la rue de la Paix, which he maintained&lt;br/&gt;until 1813. Carême gained fame in Paris for his pièces montées,&lt;br/&gt;elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly&lt;br/&gt;displayed in the pâtisserie window. He made these confections,&lt;br/&gt;which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs&lt;br/&gt;such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modeled them on temples,&lt;br/&gt;pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural&lt;br/&gt;history books that he studied at the nearby Bibliothèque Nationale,&lt;br/&gt;thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly. He&lt;br/&gt;is credited with the inventions of gros nougats and grosses&lt;br/&gt;meringues, croquantes, made of almonds and honey, and solilemmes.&lt;br/&gt;He did freelance work creating pieces principally for the French&lt;br/&gt;diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, but&lt;br/&gt;also other members of Parisian high society, including Napoleon.&lt;br/&gt;While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he&lt;br/&gt;quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses. Napoleon was&lt;br/&gt;famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of&lt;br/&gt;social relations in the world of diplomacy. In 1804, he gave money&lt;br/&gt;to Talleyrand to purchase Château de Valençay, a large estate&lt;br/&gt;outside Paris. The château was intended to act as a kind of&lt;br/&gt;diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took&lt;br/&gt;Carême with him. Carême was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a&lt;br/&gt;whole year’s worth of menus, without repetition, and using&lt;br/&gt;only seasonal produce. Carême passed the test and completed his&lt;br/&gt;training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoléon,&lt;br/&gt;Carême went to London for a time and served as chef de cuisine to&lt;br/&gt;the Prince Regent, later George IV. Returning to the continent he&lt;br/&gt;followed the invitation of Tsar Alexander I to come to St.&lt;br/&gt;Petersburg, where he lived so briefly he never prepared a meal for&lt;br/&gt;the Tsar before returning to Paris, where he was chef to banker&lt;br/&gt;James Mayer Rothschild. He died in Germany at the age of 48, due&lt;br/&gt;perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the charcoal on&lt;br/&gt;which he cooked. He is remembered as the founder of the haute&lt;br/&gt;cuisine concept and is interred in the Cimetière de Montmartre in&lt;br/&gt;Montmartre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Kid Friendly  Lunchtime&lt;br/&gt;Cache  Wheelchair&lt;br/&gt;Access  Dogs Allowed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Available&lt;br/&gt;year-round  Bicycles&lt;br/&gt;permitted on paths  Restrooms available&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Beware of Muggles!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For those that don't know of him: Georges Auguste Escoffier (28&lt;br/&gt;October 1846 – 12 February 1935) was a French chef,&lt;br/&gt;restaurateur and culinary writer who popularized and updated&lt;br/&gt;traditional French cooking methods. He is a legendary figure among&lt;br/&gt;chefs and gourmets, and was one of the most important leaders in&lt;br/&gt;the development of modern French cuisine. Much of Escoffier's&lt;br/&gt;technique was based on that of Antoine Carême, one of the codifiers&lt;br/&gt;of French haute cuisine, but Escoffier's achievement was to&lt;br/&gt;simplify and modernize Carême's elaborate and ornate style.&lt;br/&gt;Referred to by the French press as &quot;Emperor of the world kitchens&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;Escoffier was France's pre-eminent chef in the early part of the&lt;br/&gt;20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the recipes he recorded and invented, another of&lt;br/&gt;Escoffier's contributions to cooking was to elevate it to the&lt;br/&gt;status of a respected profession by introducing organized&lt;br/&gt;discipline to his kitchens. He organized his kitchens by the&lt;br/&gt;brigade de cuisine system, with each section run by a chef de&lt;br/&gt;partie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1897, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy&lt;br/&gt;Hotel. Ritz and Echenard were implicated in the disappearance of&lt;br/&gt;over £3400 of wine and spirits, and Escoffier had been receiving&lt;br/&gt;gifts from the Savoy's suppliers. By this time, however, Ritz and&lt;br/&gt;his colleagues were already on the point of commercial&lt;br/&gt;independence, having established the Ritz Hotel Development&lt;br/&gt;Company, for which Escoffier set up the kitchens and recruited the&lt;br/&gt;chefs, first at the Paris Ritz (1898), and then at the new Carlton&lt;br/&gt;Hotel in London (1899), which soon drew much of the high society&lt;br/&gt;clientèle away from the Savoy. In addition to the haute cuisine&lt;br/&gt;offered at luncheon and dinner, tea at the Ritz became a&lt;br/&gt;fashionable institution in Paris, and later in London, though it&lt;br/&gt;caused Escoffier real distress: &quot;How can one eat jam, cakes and&lt;br/&gt;pastries, and enjoy a dinner – the king of meals – an&lt;br/&gt;hour or two later? How can one appreciate the food, the cooking or&lt;br/&gt;the wines?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1913, Escoffier met Kaiser Wilhelm II on board the SS&lt;br/&gt;Imperator, one of the largest ocean liners of the Hamburg-Amerika&lt;br/&gt;Line. The culinary experience on board the Imperator was overseen&lt;br/&gt;by Ritz-Carlton, and the restaurant itself was a reproduction of&lt;br/&gt;Escoffier's Carlton Restaurant in London. Escoffier was charged&lt;br/&gt;with supervising the kitchens on board the Imperator during the&lt;br/&gt;Kaiser's visit to France. One hundred and forty-six German&lt;br/&gt;dignitaries were served a large multi-course luncheon, followed&lt;br/&gt;that evening by a monumental dinner that included the Kaiser's&lt;br/&gt;favourite strawberry pudding, named fraises Imperator by Escoffier&lt;br/&gt;for the occasion. The Kaiser was so impressed that he insisted on&lt;br/&gt;meeting Escoffier after breakfast the next day, where, as legend&lt;br/&gt;has it, he told Escoffier, &quot;I am the Emperor of Germany, but you&lt;br/&gt;are the Emperor of Chefs.&quot; This was quoted frequently in the press,&lt;br/&gt;further establishing Escoffier's reputation as France's pre-eminent&lt;br/&gt;chef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escoffier published &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot;, which is still used as&lt;br/&gt;a major reference work, both in the form of a cookbook and a&lt;br/&gt;textbook on cooking. Escoffier's recipes, techniques and approaches&lt;br/&gt;to kitchen management remain highly influential today, and have&lt;br/&gt;been adopted by chefs and restaurants not only in France, but also&lt;br/&gt;throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ritz gradually moved into retirement after opening The Ritz&lt;br/&gt;Hotel in 1906, leaving Escoffier as the figurehead of the Carlton&lt;br/&gt;until his own retirement in 1920. He continued to run the kitchens&lt;br/&gt;through World War I, in which his younger son was killed in active&lt;br/&gt;service. Recalling these years, The Times said, &quot;Colour meant so&lt;br/&gt;much to Escoffier, and a memory arises of a feast at the Carlton&lt;br/&gt;for which the table decorations were white and pink roses, with&lt;br/&gt;silvery leaves – the background for a dinner all white and&lt;br/&gt;pink, Borscht striking the deepest note, Filets de poulet à la&lt;br/&gt;Paprika coming next, and the Agneau de lait forming the high note.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Escoffier died on 12 February 1935, at the age of 88 in Monte&lt;br/&gt;Carlo, a few days after the death of his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Kid Friendly  Lunchtime&lt;br/&gt;Cache  No Wheelchair Access&lt;br/&gt; Dogs Allowed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bicycles&lt;br/&gt;permitted on paths  Less than 500&lt;br/&gt;ft. from car to cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Weather&lt;br/&gt;Permitting  Beware of Muggles!&lt;br/&gt; Bring a pen or pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache Placed by a Texas Geocacher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generated by The Selector</groundspeak:long_description>

When I proposed to LilyWarrior on Good Friday, I set up a short 5-stage multicache for her to find. She took a half day off work, so I set it up in the morning. When she got home there was a realtor-type lockbox hanging on the door (inside the garage to the house) and a note taped to the door saying go to these coordinates. At that location was a container hanging inside a sign post. Inside the container was a piece of colored foam sheet with #1 and coordinates to number 2. At the second location was another container tied with fishing line and hiding behind a fencepost. Inside it was another piece of colored foam sheet with #2 and coordinates to number 3. The third location was an Altoids tin with a magnet inside, hiding under a metal box at UTD. Inside was #3 with coordinates to #4. The fourth location contained a last piece of colored foam sheet saying &quot;You're done&quot; and a separate sheet of paper showing how to translate the colors of the four foam sheets into the combination for the lockbox, which contained a letter and the proposal.

This cache is located where the #4 container was.</groundspeak:long_description>

Saw that on &quot;Get Smart&quot; one time. 
Found with no problem, it is amazing what you find when you actually follow the GPS.
As we were signing the log, five of the cache watchmen (geese) floated over to see what we were doing.
One got within 3 feet of us before he changed direction. Glad to get this one off our list! TFTC!!

Garmin and you&lt;br/&gt;have been sent here for the offense of bad cache logging. Private&lt;br/&gt;Joker over here copied and pasted the same log into 27 caches in a&lt;br/&gt;row! And listen to this log from Private Pyle: &quot;TN/LN SL TFTC.&quot; I&lt;br/&gt;can't tell if that's supposed to be a log, or the secret recipe for&lt;br/&gt;Alpha Bits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is good news, ladies! You&lt;br/&gt;can learn to improve your cache logging! I will teach you! By the&lt;br/&gt;time you finish this course, your days of three word cache logs&lt;br/&gt;will be OVER!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your first obstacle is called a&lt;br/&gt;Liar's Cache. It's a simple 1/1 micro and even Pyle should be able&lt;br/&gt;to get to it easily. So why the 5 difficulty rating? That's where&lt;br/&gt;the lie comes in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mission is to seek out and&lt;br/&gt;find this simple 1/1, but to log it as if it were a 5/5. And I&lt;br/&gt;expect detail! I want to hear about broken limbs, four mile hikes&lt;br/&gt;uphill both ways, days of searching. I expect creativity! I expect&lt;br/&gt;ingenuity! And most of all, I expect substance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hop to it, ladies!&lt;/p&gt;

Parked at the business nearby, played frogger crossing the road following the needle on the GPS. Oh, its down there. Faced with either a 500 feet walk around to get to GZ, or climbing a 3 foot railing and then jumping down ten feet, KD decided to pick the second one as P1/2 watched from above. KD made the jump then started to lift the skirt. HOLY COW!!! When did they stop making these thing out of tin and started to use uranium-depleted armor??? That thing must weigh 40 lbs. KD had to lift with both hands and prop it against his shoulder to search for the cache with one hand. After finding the cache, KD let the skirt clang back down as he tossed the cache up to P1/2 to sign. Then KD had to lift that thing again to replace the cache.
Great, now how does KD get back up that 10 foot drop that he jumped???
He had to walk a few hundred feet, to find a lower place where he could hop back up. Then we played frogger again crossing the street.
All this without one exaggeration, well maybe one.....................

This is the first cache hidden by the mighty, mighty Blackhawks Circle of the Coppell YMCA Adventure Guides Program. 
YMCA Adventure Guides is a parent-child program designed to help foster a lifetime of companionship to strengthen the relationship between children and parents. As an Adventure Guide, fathers and their son or daughter join a unique “Circle&quot; with whom they participate in games, camping trips, and ceremonies, while fostering a sense of self-esteem, personal worth, and quality family time.

This cache is a key holder. Be sure and be stealthy since the neighbors might be watching.

Several fathers and sons participated in the hide. We hope you enjoy it.

We learned a lesson on cache saturation and had to relocate three times before finding this location.

FTF gets a Blackhawk branded leather piece and a real pre-historic arrowhead.

Ya Ta Hey !!!

Tried the south approach first (.52 miles), but after 1000 feet we realized that the path was not going the correct direction so we regrouped and attacked from the north (.40 miles). 
Found a paved path leading into the park but that only lasted a few hundred feet before we had to turn onto a dirt trial. The dirt trail had the world’s longest crack in the ground leading us almost all the way to the cache. It was one of those Texas cracks that can swallow pets and small children into the bowels of Hades. 
We followed the trail surrounded by knee high grass fields and millions of grasshoppers like the 8th plague of Egypt sent by Moses. Even at 7:30 PM, the sun beat down on us like a Mississippi prison road crew being punished for crimes against humanity. 
Finally got to GZ, prettierhalf made the spot and KD made the grab. Then we followed the crack in the ground back in the direction of our car listening to the constant movement of the grasshoppers. Got to  the AC of the car and melted into the cloth lining of the seats.
Needless to say, this was the only cache we tried today. But thanks for the cache!!

This is a two-stage multicache. The first stage should be fairly quick and easy, much like the other four caches in this series. The difficulty and terrain ratings apply to the final stage.

I've stocked the container with a bunch of swag, a few pathtags, a couple signature tokens, a geocoin, a personal travel bug just starting out, and an unactivated &quot;Bonobo Monkey&quot; travel tag. Please be good cache stewards, take only one item, and trade up or even.</groundspeak:long_description>

Loved the sign &quot;Observe but do not disturb the wildlife&quot; and it had a drawing of a snake.
If I &quot;observe&quot; a snake, then the first thing I am going to do (after wetting my pants) is to &quot;disturb&quot; it by beating it to death.
Found stage 1 with no problem. Walked toward stage 2, then we realized there was an easier approach. Took the alternative approach, and p1/2 dove in after it since KD was wearing shorts. Discovered some of the TBs. Thanks for a really nice series!! </groundspeak:text>

Just another Typical Urban Cache. Our first cache in this local area.

Urban caching here in Texas is just a bit different versus caching in Nevada. But the more we are caching here in Texas, the more that we are learning about the geographical differences. </groundspeak:long_description>

There are no trees, wires, canyons, tall grass or stumps to obstruct your fish finding GPSr or catch your hook. All true anglers know fishing takes time and the right bait. You'll need it to catch this one!  This fish will only jump for ferrous based lures, so come prepared and don't forget your pole! Seeing the cache isn't enough. You must reel this one in and put pencil to paper to claim this cache.

Bring a picnic lunch and the bikes for the kids. They can safely play while you hunt for this cache.  A curfew after 9:30 PM eliminated this as the make out place it once was. If you like this old type of construction look around and spot some of the relics, like  this hammer forged hinge. You're looking for a bison tube tucked away, it is NOT in plain view. Once you arrive at GZ there is a hint to point out the hide location.

The city is trying to keep the cedars from taking over, but they’ve lost the majority of the field. It shouldn't be that tough, right?  Okay, mix in briers, blackberry and all manner of other plants, animals and creepy crawlies.  Now, you've got a field worthy of the hunt!  You're looking for a cam 1 quart container with some trade items. 

Coordinates should be within 9 feet by my Legend.  I strongly suggest putting on the ong pants and boots for this hunt.  Small children should be carried or left at home.  I almost lost the eldest of my caching crew because of her poor choice in foot wear.  There are no paths thru this field, but you can avoid the majority of the bad stuff by picking your way around.   </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter this park, you see a big bell on a stone monument. The inscription says, &quot;This is the original Burden fire bell purchased 10-16-14 for S 40.82. Stones are from the old Burden High School. 9-12-76&quot;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geocache is not right here, but nearby. The container is a litle micro sized cylinder with a screw off lid. BYOP, bring your own pencil. I find it easier to roll the logbook and tuck it into the bottom of the lid, then screw the lid back on.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Fall River State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Positioned between the Cross Timbers region and the grasslands of the Flint Hills, Fall River State Park is home to a remarkable diversity of plant and animal life.  The 980-acre park is a unique blend of forested flood plains, blackjack savannahs, and tallgrass prairie.  Outdoors enthusiasts looking to get off the beaten track will find much to their liking here.  Bird watchers, photographers, and naturalists will enjoy a variety of native plants and animals.  Another favorite pastime is canoeing Fall River, which feeds into the 2,450-acre Fall River Reservoir.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to El Dorado State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


El Dorado Reservoir and State Park are located at the edge of the scenic Flint Hills of eastern Kansas.  The lake has approximately 8,000 surface acres of water and 98 miles of shoreline.   There are approximately 6,000 acres of land available for public hunting and roughly 4,000 acres of developed park and recreation areas for your enjoyment.  The lake was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was completed in June of 1981.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

Hiking should always be done with a hiking buddy or a hiking group; if you trip and break your leg, who's going to get you back? Make sure you fuel up your vehicle to get you to the area (and back home).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;PARKING&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best place to park to get to this geocache is at a projection from the posted coordinates: from the posted coordinates, go on a bearing of 98 degrees-true (surveyors should read this as &quot;astronomic azimuth of 98 degrees&quot;), for a distance of 0.31 mile. The trail crosses a gravel road at this point and provides for easier access. Once you get there, punch in the posted geocache coordinates and start hiking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;YOU ARE LOOKING FOR...&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a&lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; container, an ammo box with dimensions of 17 inches long, 14 inches tall, and 7 inches wide. Get a yard stick and check that out. You have to unhitch both ends of the lid in order to get to the goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;ORIGINAL CONTENTS&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items that should stay in the geocache forever:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the hardbound logbook (a real surveying field-book); a pen; a pencil; a pencil sharpener; the &quot;You Found It&quot; note with magnet-clippies to hold it up near the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swag trade items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list of trade items is provided for tracking purposes (and for your amusement). This geocache was originally stocked with lots of trade items, some being surveying related items and some being just typical swag; due to the container's size, some swag is larger than the usual &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;tuff &lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;e&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ll &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;et. Inside are some &quot;Did You Know&quot; laminated fact-cards held near the top with a magnet-clippie - feel free to take one of these promo-cards without trading for it; 5 CITO canisters with vanilla-scented trash bags inside (left overs from a past CITO event); some NSPS promo 6-inch rulers; some stackable NSPS mini-magic-markers; a sample &lt;i&gt;Point Of Beginning Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, the November 2006 issue signed on the cover by geocacher &lt;i&gt;cantuland&lt;/i&gt;; a coin-purse with a Lewis-and-Clark Edition nickel zipped up inside it; a cowgirl hair baret; a clip-on watch; a little orange hair comb; 5 bracelets, each one hand-crafted by Mrs. cantuland; a cell phone holder; a big patriotic party hat; a really bright safety-orange ball cap with gray underside so as not to blind the wearer; a cool colored floppy frisbie; an umbrella, never opened; a big toy sea turtle (Now you can find a sea turtle in Kansas); 2 little toy plastic dinosaurs - a brachiosaurus and a styracosaurus; a surveyor's &quot;peg book&quot; with lots of trigonometric formulas on the inside cover; a light-up squishy bouncy thing that sparkles with dancing lights when you press down on the top and bottom (press again to stop it so you don't get hypnotized); an 8-inch battery-powered glow stick with several different settings (also hypnotic); a box of division flash cards; surveying pamphlets; 2 &quot;hot-hands&quot; hand warmers; 2 recorder musical instruments; a first-aid kit; a mini A&amp;W mug; a purple silk hanky; a little U.S. flag; and an altoids tin filled with LUCKY pennies (they have given me lots of good luck too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some travel bugs and geocoins originally stocked include the following. Check on their journeys every now and then to see how their doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;TBVT9E - &lt;i&gt;NSPS Geocaching Project Geocoin&lt;/i&gt; that made its first appearance at a KSLS CITO event &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TB11Y6Q - &lt;i&gt;KSLS Traveling Patch #3&lt;/i&gt; touring every geocache in Kansas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TB11HB9 - &lt;i&gt;KSLS Metal Letters #1&lt;/i&gt; looking to visit every state in the U.S. (NOW MISSING)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;FIND IT!&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you get to the coordinates, keep in mind that a hand held GPS receiver will only get you &quot;close&quot;. Ask yourself, &quot;Where would a container that huge be hidden?,&quot; and go look there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you find it, be sure to sign the enclosed logbook; date it; describe what you took and what you left; and if you like, include a bit of the story of your adventure. When claiming the find with the online logs, finders are encouraged to mention a few things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you pursue geocaches placed under the NSPS Geocaching Project, please state how many of these geocaches you have found.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many different &quot;Did You Know...&quot; cards have you discovered?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you use this geocache as a place to release your travel bugs or geocoins into the wild, mention in your log what you have released; be sure to include the REFERENCE number rather than the TRACKING number on the tag or coin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Kanza Rail-Trails Conservancy, Inc.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission to place this geocache was granted by the KRTC. The placement of the container (*HUGE* container!) was done in cooperation with the hard labor volunteered by the KRTC President. The Kanza Rail-Trails Conservancy, Inc. is a private, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization made up of volunteers who are committed to recreational trail development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Trail Access…under construction.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designated sections of the trail are open to the public for non-motorized recreation, sunrise to sunset. Trails are shared by pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Trail Guidelines…&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trails are open year-round, sunrise to sunset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be alert when crossing all roadways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use public parking (city parks, streets) as close to the trail as possible. Some trailheads will have a parking area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cell phones are recommended for emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no fee to use the trails. However, if you would like to become a member or contribute to the continued development of these trails, our website and contact information is below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Trail Rules…&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pets are allowed on a lead/leash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motorized vehicles are prohibited except for maintenance, law enforcement, emergency vehicles, and motorized wheelchairs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the trail is surrounded by private land. Please stay on the trail and respect the rights of private landowners. Please – no trespassing and no littering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carry out more than you carry in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Campfires, overnight camping, fireworks, fishing, hunting, trapping, swimming, firearms, alcohol, drugs, and loitering are not permitted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Geocaching…&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several geocaches located in the KRTC trail system including the official NSPS geocache! Geocaching and rail-trails are a perfect match – the great outdoors and a beautiful journey to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to place a geocache on the trail, please contact our organization and we will help you find a good site. KRTC Board member Scott Allen of Council Grove is an avid geocacher and can be reached at 620-767-5695. President Gina Poertner would also be happy to assist you in placing a geocache. Contact her at 620-342-2477.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, adjacent farmlands are usually burned off each spring and these “prairie fires” are shared with the trail for weed control. Depending on the container, you may want to temporarily remove the caches during the burning season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BENCH MARKS&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to do your BM research. There are some to be found along the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

This is an easy leg stretching walk with hopefully little bushwacking.  The new placement was made in February, we'll see how it looks in July.

You seek a standard lock-n-lock clearly labeled as a geocache  on the sides.  This is a great place to take a break after the long miles that take you through western Kansas.  Lots of shade and relaxing noises.  The cache has some fun stuff inside for both young and old.

This rest area can be quite busy at times, please be aware of muggles in the parking area and enjoying the trail.  Make sure you look over your shoulder at the parking lot! </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Milford State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Located near Junction City on the shores of the state's largest lake, 16,000-acre Milford Reservoir, Milford State Park is a favorite getaway for outdoors loving visitors.  Park facilities include modern campgrounds, shower buildings, toilets, swimming beaches, boat ramps, picnic shelters, a full-service marina, and a multi-purpose trails system.  The park also houses a large yacht club.  Nearby Milford Nature Center and Milford Fish Hatchery offer a variety of interpretive exhibits and displays. Approximately 18,000 acres of public land surrounds Milford Reservoir on the west side and the upper end.  This land is managed to maximize production of various wildlife species.  Numerous opportunities exist for those who wish to observe or photograph wildlife on the area.  The abundant and diverse habitat supports many species of nongame birds, mammals, reptiles, and aquatic life.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We placed this cache by canoe.  I do not know how the over land routes would be.  If you go over land make sure to stay off of Private Property.  The Paddle took us about 1.5 hours, round trip, and was approximately 2 miles.

The creek is a class I float, flat water and is good for beginners.  It can get swift and fast moving after rains, so plan your trip accordingly.  Not many obstacles (strainers), but that can change as well.  Trees can fall and create a strainer.  The water is usually flat and slow enough to paddle around anything in the way.  The creek can be shallow at times so anything other than a canoe/kayak is not reccommended. 

This is a nice float that we have done several times and really enjoy it.  Not much wind due to protecting bluffs, and after a few bends everyone else is left behind and you get peace and quiet.  We have seen lots of different critters on our floats and I am sure we will see more.  This is where we turn around and go back to the launch, hence the name.

Good luck and Happy Caching!

&lt;p&gt;Manhattan, Kansas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hide number 94 for
me, but it's my first one in the Manhattan area. Hope you like my
style. I considered doing a puzzle, but decided otherwise for this
one. I grew up in this area, Manhattan, Ogden, Junction
City...Milford, Tuttle...It's all &lt;i&gt;home&lt;/i&gt; to me. You are
looking for a 30-cal ammo box painted black with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while you're in the
area, if you venture to N 39° 10.256’ W96° 36.033’ you
may find an area to perk up your interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cache In Trash
Out is an environmental activity intimately tied to geocaching.
While out there looking for nearby caches, look around and collect litter
along the trails and properly dispose of it. Practice policies of
Leave No Trace
(LNT.org), the center for outdoor ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland      </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We placed this cache during our 350.org (River of Action) CITO Event (GC1Z8JW).  It is located on the Kansas River and is classified class I river appropriate for new paddlers.  The river is a class I float, flat water and is good for beginners. It can get swift and fast moving after rains, so plan your trip accordingly. Not many obstacles (strainers), but that can change as well. Trees can fall and create a strainer. The water is usually flat and slow enough to paddle around anything in the way.  You can check river levels at the usgs gauging station website to see if there is enough water to allow you to float the river.  The kansas river should have 1100 cfs of water at this point.  It is a good idea not to paddle alone so take a cache buddy.

Cachers that were at the event signed the container and get to claim this as a find.  However the log book is empty for the next cacher to get a FTF.

I dropped a geocoin in this cache and cannot remember which one it was, also cachers that attended the event supplied lots of swag.  Remember make a fair trade and CITO!  Happy Hunting.

Do not let the yahoo map fool you it is on an island/sandbar.

Congratulations to JJTally on being the FTF after the event.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A memorial to Dr. Joseph Denison, first president of the&lt;br/&gt;Kansas State Agricultural College and to the pioneers whose&lt;br/&gt;dauntless courage and tireless energy made possible our homes and&lt;br/&gt;comforts of to-day. Riley County Historical Society, 1932.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1855, Denison was convinced by his brother-in-law, Isaac&lt;br/&gt;Goodnow, that he should move to Kansas Territory to help establish&lt;br/&gt;a new town for the New England Emigrant Aid Company. On March 13,&lt;br/&gt;1855, Denison joined a party of Company members leaving Boston, and&lt;br/&gt;made his way to Kansas Territory, which was soon to boil over with&lt;br/&gt;violence. (See Bleeding Kansas.) Over the next several years&lt;br/&gt;Denison was part of a small group that settled and built the&lt;br/&gt;abolitionist town of Manhattan, Kansas, at the union of the Kansas&lt;br/&gt;River and the Big Blue River in the Flint Hills. By 1857 Denison&lt;br/&gt;and Goodnow, along with others, hatched a plan to create a&lt;br/&gt;Methodist college in Manhattan. In April 1857, at a meeting of the&lt;br/&gt;Methodist Church Conference, a plan for the college was properly&lt;br/&gt;inaugurated. The following year, on February 9, 1858, Manhattan's&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Blue Mont Central College&quot; was incorporated by act of the Kansas&lt;br/&gt;Territorial Legislature and Territorial Governor James Denver. By&lt;br/&gt;1860, a large building was erected and the school was open and&lt;br/&gt;operating, with Denison as President. However, the institution was&lt;br/&gt;already struggling financially.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When Kansas was admitted to the United States in 1861, one of&lt;br/&gt;the first things the new state Legislature planned to do was to&lt;br/&gt;establish a state University. After two years of political&lt;br/&gt;wrangling, on February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's&lt;br/&gt;offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds, and&lt;br/&gt;established the state's Land-grant university at the site –&lt;br/&gt;the institution that would become Kansas State University. At the&lt;br/&gt;first meeting of the state Board of Regents on July 23, 1863,&lt;br/&gt;Denison was hired as the first President of Kansas State&lt;br/&gt;Agricultural College. He served in this position for ten years.&lt;br/&gt;During his term, Denison managed a number of important&lt;br/&gt;accomplishments, including establishing a faculty and acquiring&lt;br/&gt;valuable land that would later become the center of the university.&lt;br/&gt;Under his direction, the school attracted Benjamin Franklin Mudge&lt;br/&gt;as Chair of the geology department; Mudge led his Kansas State&lt;br/&gt;students on fossil-collecting expeditions to Western Kansas as part&lt;br/&gt;of the Bone Wars. Despite Denison's accomplishments, the state&lt;br/&gt;asked for his resignation in 1873. After leaving Kansas State,&lt;br/&gt;Denison was hired as President of Baker University, a Methodist&lt;br/&gt;school in Baldwin City, Kansas. He held this position from 1874 to&lt;br/&gt;1879, before retiring to work with the Methodist church in the town&lt;br/&gt;he helped settle, Manhattan. He died on February 19, 1900, in&lt;br/&gt;Manhattan, which had by then grown into a thriving college town of&lt;br/&gt;3,500.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Legolaws for the FTF!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

You will have to demonstrate some of your own daring in order to reach the cache.  Please be careful replacing the cache as it could become unreachable quite easily.
Happy caching.

Once used for farming, this site became the community park it is today with the help of several neighborhood and conservation groups. Just over half of the site is dedicated to manicured, turf park activities, while the remainder is used for a native prairie grass exhibit.
 
Northeast Community Park has two practice soccer and baseball/softball fields, a maintenance building with public restrooms, a two-mile walking trail, and a picnic shelter with six picnic tables. 


Future plans include two playgrounds, two picnic shelters, a community/nature center, a pedestrian bridge connecting the park and linear trail, and basketball, tennis, and volleyball courts.

Park Amenities

20'x34' Picnic Shelter w/ 6 tables (several ADA accessible) 
ADA parking Cooking grill and water faucet 
Pedestal drinking fountain 
Public restrooms in northeast corner of park, w/ drinking fountain 
Walking Trail and benches

Every Wednesday during the late spring, summer, and early fall there is a farmer market.  So plan ahead and bring home some fresh flowers or produce.  Enjoy the area.

This is my first micro cache so please let me know if I need to up the difficulty.  I am purposely not leaving a hint, experienced cachers probably wont have a problem.

Congratulations Alien Bounty Hunter FTF!

High winds, heavy rains, lightning, some small hail...you know, Kansas in April. SURELY, no one would go for FTF in this! First thing this morning, get W off to day-care, check the cache is still not logged, get the GPS loaded up and head out just as the rains are stopping. Find the cache easy enough, open it up to grab our first FTF, and what pops out first but that oh-so-familar magnet with those oh-so-familiar initials! 

Really like this cache and location; my sprite 95 y.o. grandmother taught in one like this in SW Kansas many years ago. Good to see it's being kept for the history! TNLNSL, and Thx4the$</groundspeak:text>

It is across the river from the more popular and well known Rocky Ford area maintained by the KDWP.  The West side is maintained by Riley County Parks and Recreation, they have given premission to place the cache.  They are improving the area and at some point want it to look like the picture on their website. (I have also put a link to it below.)  Enjoy the area, bring your fishing gear and relax to the sounds of water falling.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Rocky Ford Wildlife Area and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Native Americans used this site as a river crossing.  The flat, rock bottom made the crossing safe under normal conditions.  The ford was used by pioneers for many years. A timber and rock dam provided hydro-mechanical power for a flour and saw mill that served the community for many years.   The mill was converted to a concrete power dam, built by the Rocky Ford Milling and Power Company in the early 1900s.  The area had long been used for community picnics and swimming.  The hollow dam was also used by employees to get to and from work, from company-owned housing on the west side of the Big Blue River to the power plant on the east bank.   Land and water were purchased through a National Recreation and Trails Grant (NRT).  This added nearly one mile of river access on the east side of the Big Blue River from Tuttle Creek State Park’s Rocky Ford Campground to the original Rocky Ford Fishing Area and then south to the bridge at Dyer Road. A concrete walkway, named The Heritage Trail, runs the entire length with benches and angular access sites.  The trail is open to outdoor enthusiasts including hikers, bikers, anglers, and nature enthusiasts.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

The lake is usually calm and easily paddled in a canoe.  There is a fee to enter the park.  If you park and launch at N39 15.321 W096 34.680 you can also rent canoes or kayaks at this location.  Visit the related webpage for phone numbers to call to check availability of boats.  I am including a waypoint where you do not have to pay the entry fee, but you will have to worry about the low head dam.  WARNING Rocky Ford dam area is downstream of this launch.  So be extra careful to make the correct turn into the river pond area.  Use this launching site at your own risk. The coordinates for it are N39 14.834 W096 35.564  

We enjoy canoeing on the river pond and have seen numerous signs of wildlife and waterfowl.  It is smaller so you will not have to contend with motorboats, which is nice.  Happy hunting and cache on!

Congratulations to bearfamily2009 on the FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Prior to July, 1993, the area below the flood spillway was a
gently sloping, grassy recreational area used for dirt bikes.
Erosion was initiated in early July when some water was released
(10,000 to 25,000 cfs) through the gates just to keep the rising
flood waters from running uncontrolled over the top of the
spillway. However, the water level in the reservoir continued to
rise, and all 18 floodgates were opened, greatly accelerating the
erosion processes. In fact, this was the first time since the dam
project was completed in 1962 that the gates were opened. When the
gates were closed later, it was discovered that the landscape of
the spillway channel had been transformed into a craggy,
variegated, and multilayered canyon. Geologists and laymen have
been presented with a unique opportunity to have a horizontal view
of thousands of square meters of strata that usually are observable
primarily in vertical sections (e.g., roadcuts, hillsides,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1993 intense rains raised the level of Tuttle
Creek Lake 61 feet above normal pool and started to overflow the
spillway gates. Up to 60,00 cfs was released at the height of the
flood. The water travel down tothe Kansas river with 380,00 cubic
yards of material eroded from the spillway channel. &quot;... it was
turbulent, rolling, rocking, and cutting as it moved, carrying tons
of sediment that acted like a chisel, a drill, a grinder, and a
thousand bulldozers, all in one. The resulting mass of water hit
the loose and poorly consolidated sediment and rocks below the
spillway lip like a massive explosion — lifting, cutting, and
churning its way ... carrying along hundreds of tons of boulders,
gravel, sands, shale, and limestone which it had just torn loose as
it roared over the rock surface.&quot; (Archer et al., 1993) The roar of
the water could be heard from half a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strata exposed below the spillway have been identified as
Paleozoic, representing late Pennsylvanian through early Permian
systems which, in evolutionary time, are thought to be about 290
million years old. The concrete spillway rests upon the Neva
Limestone and the underlying Salem Point Shale. A variety of both
invertebrate body and trace fossils may be found in the newly
exposed strata (Archer et al., 1993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Means of Erosion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock strata below the spillway at Tuttle Creek is marked by
joints (fractures) which represent structural weaknesses (Archer et
al., 1993; Anon., 1993). Such joints, which are roughly parallel
and may extend through strata for long distances horizontally and
vertically, likely contributed to the rocks being ripped away by
the fast moving water. The erosive action was doubtlessly aided by
the velocity of the water and its sediment load which consisted of
abrasive matter such as sand, gravel, boulders, etc. Physical
processes associated with macroturbulent flow, which contribute to
erosion of bedrock during catastrophic flooding, have been
elucidated by Austin (1991b; p. 88). These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Cavitation — a rock pulverizing process resulting from
the implosion or collapse of vacuum bubbles (see also Holroyd,
1990a and 1990b)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Plucking, or the hydraulic lifting of large blocks of bedrock
— a suction process which results from the vortex action of a
&quot;kolk&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could such processes have been active in these cases of rapid
canyon formation? Hydraulic plucking obviously occurred, since
large blocks of bedrock were scattered haphazardly downstream at
Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That cavitation may have taken place is not as evident. Holroyd
(1990a, p. 24) instanced data from the Bureau of Reclamation
indicating that cavitation may occur at fluid flow speeds greater
than 30 meters per second (67 mph). Austin (1991b, p. 88) cited
NASA data which suggest that cavitation may be associated with
fluid flows as slow as 30 ft per second (20 mph). It was in fact
earlier noted that water moved down the Manhattan spillway at
60,000 cfs suggesting that conditions conducive to cavitation could
have existed during the canyon's formation. It is also possible
that continued pulverizing and weakening of the rock and subsequent
erosive action could obliterate any direct physical evidence of
cavitation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This earthcache will place you between Tuttle Creek Dam and the
Spillway System. You will need to cross the earthworks dam coming
from the west or the Spillway System coming from the east. There
has been construction to reinforce the dam for several years and
the information sign you are looking for has been inaccessible
during that time. It is along Highway 13 so watch for traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spillway Fault System at Tuttle Creek Dam is a geological
feature that can be seen in the east side of the spillway cut. Rock
layers are offset along diagonal lines that can be traced along the
face of the cut. Signs in the northwest spillway parking lot
identify the faults visible on the opposite wall. These faults were
discovered during investigations prior to construction of the dam.
The faults actually extend across the lake and have been traced in
the hills on the west side of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features have also been traced for several miles to the
east of the spillway. The faults do not extend below any part of
the dam or spillway gates. No earthquakes in historic times have
been associated with these faults. Microseismic studies have been
conducted by the Kansas Geological Survey with funding from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These studies used very sensitive
instruments to detect earthquakes that cannot be felt and did not
show any recent activity related to this fault system. Additional
investigations also show that there are no disturbances in the
surface soils above the fault that indicate any recent
activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These faults are not considered active, and do not pose a danger
to Tuttle Creek Dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK now some educational stuff about faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geologists can categorize faults into three groups based on the
sense of slip:&lt;br/&gt;
1. a fault where the relative movement (or slip) on the fault plane
is approximately vertical is known as a dip-slip fault&lt;br/&gt;
2. where the slip is approximately horizontal, the fault is known
as a transcurrent or strike-slip fault&lt;br/&gt;
3. an oblique-slip fault has non-zero components of both strike and
dip slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all naming distinctions, it is the orientation of the net
dip and sense of slip of the fault which must be considered, not
the present-day orientation, which may have been altered by local
or regional folding or tilting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dip-slip faults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dip-slip faults can be sub-classified into the types &quot;reverse&quot;
and &quot;normal&quot;. A normal fault occurs when the crust is extended.
Alternatively such a fault can be called an extensional fault. The
hanging wall moves downward, relative to the footwall. A downthrown
block between two normal faults dipping towards each other is
called a graben. An upthrown block between two normal faults
dipping away from each other is called a horst. Low-angle normal
faults with regional tectonic significance may be designated
detachment faults.&lt;br/&gt;
A reverse fault is the opposite of a normal fault — the
hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall. Reverse faults
indicate shortening of the crust. The dip of a reverse fault is
relatively steep, greater than 45°.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A thrust fault has the same sense of motion as a reverse fault, but
with the dip of the fault plane at less than 45°. Thrust faults
typically form ramps, flats and fault-bend (hanging wall and foot
wall) folds. Thrust faults form nappes and klippen in the large
thrust belts.&lt;br/&gt;
The fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface
of a fault. Flat segments of thrust fault planes are known as
flats, and inclined sections of the thrust are known as ramps.
Typically, thrust faults move within formations by forming flats,
and climb up section with ramps.&lt;br/&gt;
Fault-bend folds are formed by movement of the hanging wall over a
non-planar fault surface and are found associated with both
extensional and thrust faults.&lt;br/&gt;
Faults may be reactivated at a later time with the movement in the
opposite direction to the original movement (fault inversion). A
normal fault may therefore become a reverse fault and vice
versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strike-slip faults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fault surface is usually near vertical and the footwall
moves either left or right or laterally with very little vertical
motion. Strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known
as sinistral faults. Those with right-lateral motion are also known
as dextral faults.&lt;br/&gt;
A special class of strike-slip faults is the transform fault, where
such faults form a plate boundary. These are found related to
offsets in spreading centers, such as mid-ocean ridges, and less
commonly within continental lithosphere, such as the Alpine Fault,
New Zealand. Transform faults are also referred to as conservative
plate boundaries, as lithosphere is neither created nor
destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oblique-slip faults&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fault which has a component of dip-slip and a component of
strike-slip is termed an oblique-slip fault. Nearly all faults will
have some component of both dip-slip and strike-slip, so defining a
fault as oblique requires both dip and strike components to be
measurable and significant. Some oblique faults occur within
transtensional and transpressional regimes, others occur where the
direction of extension or shortening changes during the deformation
but the earlier formed faults remain active.&lt;br/&gt;
The hade angle is defined as the complement of the dip angle; it is
the angle between the fault plane and a vertical plane that strikes
parallel to the fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listric fault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A listric fault is a type of normal fault in which fault plane
is curved. The dip of the fault plane becomes shallower with
depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ring fault&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring faults are faults that occur within collapsed volcanic
calderas. Ring faults may be filled by ring dikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for the logging requirements:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Email me with the answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Tell me what type of fault you think the Spillway Fault
System is.&lt;br/&gt;
2. From the information board: Tell me what scale is used in the
map in the upper right corner of the information board.&lt;br/&gt;
3. From the coordnates you can see the spillway to the east. Look
at the end closest to you and find the numbers on the spillway.
Tell me the top most number and the largest number you can
see.&lt;br/&gt;
4. You can also post a picture of yourself at the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks and I hope you enjoy my Earthcache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to JJTally on the FTF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A short, relaxing stroll near Tuttle Creek Lake.  After several years, the hard work of stabilizing the dam has been completed, and this area has been re-opened to the public.  This can be a good place to have a camera, binoculars, or a fishing pole in your caching kit!

You're looking for a preform along a well established trail with a bit of gradient.  Cache is log-and-pencil, might hold very small items that are less than the diameter of a quarter, and should be a relatively easy find.  As with all caches in the area, this one can get more challenging with any rain, snow, ice, snakes, ticks, blah, blah, blah...  This is a dead-end trail, so you'll probably meet any muggles both coming and going.  Cache is placed at approx. 1129 FASL.  FTF Award is a 10 ruble bill!

Special thanks for this cache goes to &quot;Corp Of Discovery&quot;, who graciously provided the cache container when we met out on the ol' caching trail.  Didn't take too long to figure out where the next &quot;Corps&quot; cache should go!

Congratulations to susan.c and AltCtrl for First To Find!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Tuttle Creek State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply.

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Tuttle Creek State Park offers visitors a broad variety of outdoor recreation possibilities and plenty of room to roam.  Four units (River Pond, Spillway, Fancy Creek and Randolph) make up the 1,200 - acre park.  Tuttle Creek Reservoir, the state's second largest impoundment, offers 12,500 acres of water and approximately 100 miles of rugged, wooded shoreline to explore.   Numerous nature trails, a mountain biking trail, and a scenic equestrian trail offer explorers a variety of routes to experience the aesthetic Flint Hills environment.  Scenic picnic areas, an 18-hole disc golf course, volleyball courts, horse shoe pits, and conveniently placed restroom and shower facilities accommodate park visitors.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is cache #1 of a 10 part series touring Tuttle Creek Reservoir. This cache is placed near the former town of Stockdale, at approximately 1109 feet above sea level. A map showing the location of Stockdale is included in the cache. Depending on lake levels, alternate routes to easy parking near the cache are possible, then some moderate bushwhacking to the cache from there. 


It is possible, though not required, to access this cache by boat. If you choose this route, please take note of lake conditions and wear your life jackets! 
July 4, 2009 marks the 50th Anniversary of the closure of the Big Blue River, and the creation of Tuttle Creek Reservoir. This cache was placed in commemoration of this event and to explore the many towns affected by the creation of the reservoir. Some of these towns have prospered, others have become a footnote to history; all are worth remembering and exploring.

The routes to each of these caches will lead you through the Flint Hills of Kansas and the Big Blue River Valley, some of the prettiest scenery in the state. You will travel U.S. and State highways, well-maintained county roads, and not-so-well-maintained roads. There are also numerous possible ways to get to any one cache, a detailed map showing the winding county roads is advised. Weather permitting, 4WD should not be necessary for any cache…weather permitting! All caches in this series are plastic Lock-N-Locks with Geocaching markings, and are on public property. Please respect any private property near the cache stages. All caches are placed above 1075 FASL; however, changing water elevations within the reservoir may increase the challenge of finding any one! Current water elevations may be found on the U.S. Corps of Engineers webpage listed below (follow the “Daily Lake Information” link).

Tuttle Creek Reservoir was constructed primarily for flood control along the Big Blue River. The normal water elevation in Tuttle Creek is 1075 FASL. The all-time maximum water elevation in Tuttle Creek Reservoir was reached on July 23, 1993; 1137.77 feet, almost 63 feet above flood stage! Since its construction, Tuttle Creek Reservoir has been credited in preventing over $3 Billion dollars of flood damage from the dam just north of Manhattan to the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers in Kansas City, Kansas. Numerous year-round recreational activities are also provided by the reservoir, including camping, boating, fishing, hunting, and geocaching.

The coordinates of the dam at the outlet structure are N39 15.213 W096 36.104. These coordinates are given simply to track the extent of Tuttle Creek Reservoir, and are not needed to find any cache.

Congratulations to Alien Bounty Hunter for FTF! Even if it was under less than ideal circumstances.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The scenic attributes of the tallgrass prairie: spaciousness,
expansive grasslands, and rolling terrain are exemplified in the
Flint Hills. The least disturbed and largest remaining tracts of
tallgrass prairie lie in the Flint Hills, a sixty mile wide band
extending from Oklahoma to this area. This region is truly unique
in the North American landscape, and is worthy of preservation as a
resource of national signifigance.&lt;br/&gt;
The Flint Hills are underlain by layers of limestone and shales
which were deposited by ancient inland seas that covered the mid
continent millions of yeras ago. Large quantities of flint and
chert nodules formed within the limestone, as percolating waters
dropped silica around bits of shell and plant stems.&lt;br/&gt;
Later the region was uplifted and the seas drained. Sixty million
years of erosion removed the overlying sediments. The limestones,
more arrestant than the shales, formed the numerous ridges. The
hard, insoluble chert nodules have been left behind to give the
Flint Hills their name. The flat topped hills and deeply dissected
scarps with terraced slopes provide splendid scenic vistas.
&lt;p&gt;The Flint Hills were created approximately 250 million years ago
during the Permian Period. During this time much of the Midwest,
including Kansas and Oklahoma, were covered with shallow seas. As a
result, much of the Flint Hills are composed of limestone and shale
with plentiful fossils of prehistoric sea creatures. The most
notable layer of chert-bearing limestone is the Florence Limestone
Member. It is approximately 45 feet thick; numerous roadcuts of the
Florence Member are prominent along Interstate 70 in Riley County,
Kansas. Many of the honey-colored limestones have been used for
building blocks. The non-chert-bearing limetones are best for this,
since the chert is extremely hard to cut, yet it can fracture quite
easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the mid-1800s homesteaders replaced the American
Indian in the Flint Hills. Due to shallow outcroppings of limestone
and chert, farming was not practical over much of the area, and
cattle ranching became the main agricultural activity in the
region. Still sparsely developed, the Flint Hills represent the
last expanse of tallgrass prairie in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, go to the coordinates and find the plaque/sign and email
me the name of the person who gave the quote written on the
plaque/sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, look to the west and include in your email your best
guess as to how tall the limestone hill is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, take a picture of yourself in front of the Flint Hills at
this location. Hope you enjoy the trip through the Flint Hills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to JJTally on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;This is the land where tallgrasses reign supreme, where tree is a stranger.  Big bluestem, switchgrass, and Indiangrass predominate, joining a host of broad-leaved forbs with remarkable flowers and seed heads.  Thriving on warm humid summers, this complex array of deep-rooted plants is well adapted to fire, droughts, and grazing.  Annual growth of six feet or more results in vast stands of grass, waving and rolling as the ancient seas which gave birth to the Flint Hills.
The treeless, grassy expanse once supported countless bison, elk, and pronghorn, stealthily surveyed by the grey wolf.  Although these natives have vanished, victims of the Euroamericn settlers, the tallgrass prairie manages to flourish as it has for millennia.  Adaptable to all but human intrusion, the fate of these virgin stands rests with us.  Recognintion of the Flint Hills' significance, and an understanding of the role we must assume in the conservation of this unique resource, are critical if the Flint Hills are to be preserved ar the largest remaining intact tallgrass prairie on the continent.&quot;
Taken from a plaque at the site.

Good Luck and happy hunting.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is cache #2 of a 10 part series touring Tuttle Creek Reservoir.  This cache is placed near the former town of Garrison at approximately 1130 feet above sea level.  A map showing the location of Garrison is included in the cache.  Parking is located nearby, with a light hike along an unmaintained trail to the cache.  During winter, access to this cache by vehicle on the road may be tricky.

It is possible, though not required, to access this cache by boat.  If you choose this route, please take note of lake conditions and wear your life jackets!

July 4, 2009 marks the 50th Anniversary of the closure of the Big Blue River, and the creation of Tuttle Creek Reservoir.  This cache was placed in commemoration of this event and to explore the many towns affected by the creation of the reservoir.  Some of these towns have prospered, others have become a footnote to history; all are worth remembering and exploring.

The routes to each of these caches will lead you through the Flint Hills of Kansas and the Big Blue River Valley, some of the prettiest scenery in the state.  You will travel U.S. and State highways, well-maintained county roads, and not-so-well-maintained roads.  There are also numerous possible ways to get to any one cache, a detailed map showing the winding county roads is advised. Weather permitting, 4WD should not be necessary for any cache…weather permitting.  All caches in this series are plastic Lock-N-Locks with Geocaching markings, and are on public property.  Please respect any private property near the cache stages.  All caches are placed above 1075 FASL; however, changing water elevations within the reservoir may increase the challenge of finding any one!  Current water elevations may be found on the U.S. CoE webpage listed below (follow the “Daily Lake Information” link).

Tuttle Creek Reservoir was constructed primarily for flood control along the Big Blue River.  The normal water elevation in Tuttle Creek is 1075 FASL.  The all-time maximum water elevation in Tuttle Creek Reservoir was reached on July 23, 1993; 1137.77 feet, almost 63 feet above flood stage!  Since its construction, Tuttle Creek Reservoir has been credited in preventing over $3 Billion dollars of flood damage from the dam just north of Manhattan to the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers in Kansas City, Kansas.  Numerous year-round recreational activities are also provided by the reservoir, including camping, boating, fishing, hunting, and geocaching.

Tuttle Creek Reservoir was constructed primarily for flood control along the Big Blue River.  The normal water elevation in Tuttle Creek is 1075 feet Above Sea Level.  The all-time maximum water elevation in Tuttle Creek reservoir was reached on July 23, 1993; 1137.77 feet ASL, almost 63 feet above flood stage!  Since its construction, Tuttle Creek Reservoir has been credited in preventing over $3 Billion dollars of flood damage from the dam just north of Manhattan to the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers in Kansas City, Kansas.  Numerous year-round recreational activities are also provided by the reservoir, including camping, boating, fishing, hunting, and geocaching.

This cache is placed near the former location of the community of Cleburne at approximately 1157 feet above sea level.  Parking is located nearby with a short walk to the cache from there.  This cache is located in a public hunting area, please note any active hunting seasons and share the space, there’s plenty of room for everyone.

This could be a seasonally difficult find, or to even get to, especially if it's been wet.  And watch your step, there's a few holes around here!

July 4, 2009 marks the 50th Anniversary of the closure of the Big Blue River, and the creation of Tuttle Creek Reservoir.  This cache was placed in commemoration of this event and to explore the many towns affected by the creation of the reservoir.  Some of these towns have prospered, others have become a footnote to history; all are worth remembering and exploring.

The routes to each of these caches will lead you through the Flint Hills of Kansas and the Big Blue River Valley, some of the prettiest scenery in the state.  You will travel U.S. and State highways, well-maintained county roads, and not-so-well-maintained roads.  There are also numerous possible ways to get to any one cache; a detailed map showing the winding county roads is advised. Weather permitting; 4WD should not be necessary for any cache…weather permitting!  All caches in this series are plastic Lock-N-Locks with Geocaching markings, and are on public property.  Please respect any private property near the cache stages.  All caches are placed above 1075 FASL; however, changing water elevations within the reservoir may increase the challenge of finding any one!  Current water elevations may be found on the U.S. CoE webpage listed below (follow the “Daily Lake Information” link).

This is a cache that won't take very long to find. But allow enough time to take the trails, and learn a little of the history of this place. Alcove Spring was a stop on the Oregon Trail. There are wagon swales to view, A spring, carvings of pioneers from 1840's, and many other things. 
There is a self guided, clearly marked, walking trail around the whole area. 
This is where the pioneers crossed the Blue River. The crossing is named Independence. To the north is the camp ground. Some had to stay too long, others could get right across depending on how high the water was. 
Please be sure to explore both sides of the road. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A spring is any natural occurrence where water flows on to the
surface of the earth from below the surface, and is thus where the
aquifer surface meets the ground surface.
&lt;p&gt;A spring may be the result of karst topography where surface
water has infiltrated the Earth's surface (recharge area), becoming
part of the area groundwater. The groundwater then travels though a
network of cracks and fissures - openings ranging from
intergranular spaces to large caves. The water eventually emerges
from below the surface, in the form of a spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a
confined aquifer in which the recharge area of the spring water
table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring
water forced to the surface by elevated sources are artesian wells.
This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a 300-foot
deep cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher
elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower
elevation opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonartesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation
through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a
spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still other springs are the result of pressure from an
underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic activity.
The result can be water at elevated temperature as a hot
spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable
bedrock such as limestone and dolmite creating vast cave
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of spring outlets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seepage or filtration spring. The term seep refers to springs
with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered into
permeable earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fracture springs, discharge from faults, joints, or fissures in
the earth, in which springs have followed a natural course of voids
or weaknesses in the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tubular springs are essentially water dissolved and create
underground channels, basically cave systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springs mark the intersection between human and natural history.
There is probably no better example in Kansas than Alcove Spring in
southern Marshall County. Water flows from Permian limestone into a
shallow pool covered with watercress, before making its way to the
nearby Big Blue River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just above the spring is an intermittent waterfall. This is a
noted stop along the Oregon Trail; in 1846, traveler George L.
Curry wrote that &quot;the water is of the most excellent kind.…&quot;
In 1951, Survey geologist Walter Schoewe wrote, &quot;Water, pure and
cold, issuing from the springs gives rise to a streamlet 3 to 4
feet wide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to comprehend what it must have been like for the
pioneers who traveled the Oregon Trail in the mid 1800's. Traveling
at the pace that a person could walk, it took all summer to make
the cross country trek . Imagine their relief and delight then to
be greeted after a few weeks in their journey by the beauty of
Alcove Spring. The spring itself gurgles up from the base of the
alcove. A wet-weather creek flows over the ledge of rocks and into
the pool below to form a beautiful ten foot waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The ill-fated Donner Party camped at Alcove Spring from May 26
to May 31 1846, waiting for the Blue River to go down so that they
could safely cross at nearby Independence Crossing. In fact, it was
one of their party, Edwin Bryant, who named the spring Alcove
Spring. The first member of the Donner Party to die was Sarah
Keyes, and she did so while they were camped at Alcove Springs. The
70 year-old Keyes, who was in poor health before she started the
journey, was in route to Idaho to see her son there one last time.
Though the exact location of her grave site has been lost to
history, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed and
dedicated a marker for her at Alcove Spring in 1950. It is at the
edge of the parking lot and about 1/4 mile from the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging requirements:Email the answers to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What type of spring and outlets do you think Alcove Spring
is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. On the plaque at the coordinates whose journal was quoted
from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. On the plaque, Who provided the photo of the carving on the
rock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Take a picture of yourself with the falls in the
background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Phil &amp; Verla from OZ on the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

It took us a while to find the name etched into the rock but it was fun to see it once we found it. It was fun thinking about how this place looked surrounded by travellers in wagons heading west.

Follow the signs on Hwy 77 to come explore this beautiful historic site on the Oregon Trail.  Alcove Spring was a rest stop,  and a place to ford the Blue River.  You can see the wagon swales, the carvings left in the rocks by the early travelers, and see where they forded the river.  

While here follow the many trails, find the other caches here (there are 2 others), experience some of what the Indians, trappers, and pioneers felt.  You will see the beauty of this part of Kansas, that people are surprised exists.    

Plan some extra time here to hike the many trails.  There are 7 miles  of  well marked trails here in the park.  You will find a spring that never goes dry, woods, meadows, hills, and vistas to view.   
Marysville to the north has 5  caches and Blue Rapids to the south has 3 caches.  Come spend some time in our beautiful part of  Kansas.     

The cache is a large plastic coffee jar with a red lid.  The usual trade items.  Nothing of great value.  For the first to find there is a new Travel Bug for you to activate.  Please let me know where you place it.  I'd like to follow it.    

Good Luck and Happy Caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

We looked around a little bit before she spotted the point that made the most sense and brought me over. Of course that is where it is! The easiest way to get to it was the most difficult way as far as terrain goes. I was wearing shoes that are pretty worn and slick on the bottom, and I did almost go for a slide a couple of times. However, we were able to overcome these obstacles and sign the log. This is a neat little place with a really cool view, a perfect spot for a cache! Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

Congratulations to the renowned team, ladycache and RogerDodger on their First to Find! 

 When I was driving down this &quot;Low Maintenance Road&quot; a few months ago, I had to stop here.  Not because of the road, but because of the area.  There was just something...right...here.

I brought the Lady and the Kid here, and they thought it was a cool place too.  So once you've found this cache, and it is easy to find, spend some quiet time here before you leave.

I'm calling this a memorial cache, dedicated to my Dad.

Now, these &quot;Low Maintenance Roads&quot; get kind of sloppy after a rain, so you might want to wait until a dry spell if you aren't using all wheel drive!</groundspeak:long_description>

to pir2^3 on the First To Solve and Find! 

 Don't do any searching at the published coordinates, unless you are
wearing a police uniform! (it's the parking lot for the police
station )
&lt;p&gt;Located 13 miles from the Omaha VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR),
the GRETT intersection is used by aircraft flying in the clouds(as
well as those flying in good weather) as reporting point. A named
place that they will fly by on their way to Omaha, or a place where
they will begin navigation away from Omaha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRETT can by identified by tuning two radios, The VOR reciever,
and one of the following, A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) at the
Plattsmouth airport, or a Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) that
communicates with the Omaha VOR. It can also be identified with a
GPSr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located as close as I could get and not have the
cache plowed in the spring, or make the nearby police nervous
. The coordinates are, of course,
published, just not here. You have to know where to look for them.
Once you get those coordinates, convert them to dd mm.mmm, then
just add .051 to the longitude and you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Goodness Sake, Don't park on 72nd Street! Way too much
comatose traffic on that street!&lt;/p&gt;

Had solved this one a few weeks ago... guess I had been afraid it would be hard to solve, but didn't have much trouble, should have done it sooner. Lots of family in town visiting... six of us went out to get it including GuitarMan24 and GeoKid#3. A first time cacher in our group led us to ground zero and I spotted this nice big cache as we approached. GM24 retrieved it for us and we made a few trades. Great cache and a good hide...

A BIT OF HISTORY:&lt;br/&gt;
Built in 1890, this one-room schoolhouse was constructed south of
the township of Portal, Nebraska, in Sarpy County. The town of
Portal was abandoned in the early 1900's due to frequent flooding.
Most of its residents moved to nearby Papillion. The Portal School
was still utilized for many years and was the last rural
eight-grade school to close its doors in Sarpy County. In 1995 the
old school building was moved from 114th and Giles to 242 North
Jefferson Street in Papillion and placed next to the historic
Sautter House.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The John Sautter Farmhouse is a distinctly German structure. The
dwelling, of nogged-frame construction, was built in the late 1860s
by John Sautter, Sr., a native of Wurttemberg, Germany. Sautter
operated a grist mill for a number of years and served as one of
the founders of the First Lutheran Church of Papillion. The Sautter
House stood originally on a farm located just north of the present
city limits of Papillion. In the 1970s housing developments
destroyed the original farm setting. The house was moved in 1979,
saving it from demolition.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Both buildings are owned and maintained by the Papillion Area
Historical Society.</groundspeak:long_description>

 When I was younger (much younger!) I always wanted to fly out of the South Omaha Airport.  Alas, I was too late!

--This is an excerpt from &quot;Abandoned and Little-Known Airfields&quot;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This small general aviation airport was evidently established at some point between 1945-48 (like hundreds of other general aviation fields across the U.S.), as it was not yet depicted on the September 1945 Lincoln Sectional Chart. The earliest depiction of South Omaha Airport which has been located
was on the September 1948 Lincoln Sectional Chart. It depicted the field as having a 2,400' unpaved runway.
Two B-25 Mitchell bombers sat at South Omaha Airport for years:
“The B-25s arrived at South Omaha airport in 1959 with the intent to be converted to tankers. Due to unknown circumstances, they sat untouched for several years. I can't remember the company name or the individuals who  purchased the planes, but they were known as 'The B-25 King'.”
“The Cub was the local trainer belonging to Harry McCandless who was the FBO. He relocated from the former Council Bluffs Airport [in IA].”

According to Nelson Carpenter, “Two B-25 bombers had sat idle along the edge of the airfield for years. The original owner of the bombers was going to convert them into tankers for fighting forest fires. That never matured. The planes were sold to a movie company that retrofitted new engines and made them airworthy for flying off the sod field.”

David Gurkin provided additional details about the B-25s at South Omaha Airport:
“My brother was stationed at Offutt AFB in the early 1980s.
I was visiting with him in November 1980 when one of his friends mentioned there are 2 B-25s at South Omaha Airport
being readied for a ferry flight to California. We grabbed our cameras &amp; drove to the airport where there was a small group of people gathered to witness the event. B-25 N3442G was the 1st of the planes to fly. N3442G departed South Omaha airport in late afternoon with only enough fuel to fly to Eppley Field, Omaha's main airport. The pilots said they wanted the maintenance crew to inspect the aircraft after the short flight
and if all was well, they would top the tanks &amp; head west.
I can't recall when the 2nd aircraft was ferried from South Omaha.”

Mike Zimmer recalled, “While stationed at Offutt AFB,
I often rented a 152 or 172 from the South Omaha FBO.
The people who ran the operation were a husband &amp; wife team. He was a Lt Col who flew the E-4B (emergency airborne command center) at Offutt and his wife handled the books (very nice folks). During the summer, they would organize a mass launch from South Omaha to any nearby fly-in breakfast.”

Mike Zimmer recalled, “The Lt Col [who operated South Omaha Airport] retired from the Air Force in the summer of 1985 and they moved to MN where he flew for Northwest Airlines. The FBO was shut down but the field remained operational for the people who hangared their planes there.”

According to Nelson Carpenter, “The airport closed in the mid-1980s following the early death of Harry McCandless. The soon-to-be developer of Eagle Ridge had bought the airport leaving it open for a very short period until he finally closed it.
Apparently there was a better return on his investment with the construction and sale of new houses.”

The South Omaha Airport was closed by 1986,
as it was no longer listed among active airfields in the 1986 Flight Guide (according to Chris Kennedy).

Mike Zimmer recalled, “By the time I left Offutt in 1987, the planes [at South Omaha Airport] were gone as well as the hangars &amp; FBO building.”

If you stand just to the east of the cache, at the coordinates listed, and look to the southeast (Heading 150 for you pilots), you will be taking in a view similar to what a pilot getting ready to take off on runway 15 (later runway 14), albeit, without all the houses.

Stage 2 is a good size lock-n-lock container. As with any cache, please use stealth to conceal the location from muggles along the walking path and re-hide the container well. I suggest that you take the stage 2 cache to the nearby picnic table and enjoy the view of the lake while you sign the log and do your trading.

I had walked around Schwer Park several times scouting out places to hide a cache. One spot in particular &quot;struck&quot; me and reminded me of my favorite band Carbon Leaf. The staged caches are hidden in places referenced in Carbon Leaf song lyrics. In particular, listen to the song &quot;Indecision&quot; on their 2009 album release &quot;Nothing Rhymes with Woman&quot;. It might be fun to trade things in this cache that are referenced in other Carbon Leaf song lyrics. If you are not familiar with the band, here are some suggestions: &quot;a pine cone dipped in glitter glue&quot;, &quot;a penny 1942&quot;, &quot;x-ray goggles&quot; or an &quot;x-ray gun&quot;, a &quot;bag of bones&quot;, or even &quot;Olive Oyl&quot;. If you do think of something clever to leave, log which song and lyrics it represents.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed along a paved walking path in the Portal Ridge neighborhood. After you find it, take the cache to the nearby bench to sign the log. As with any cache, please use stealth to conceal the location from muggles on the walking path and re-hide the container well.

The original cache was a screw top plastic container with sufficient room for trades, travel bugs, and coins. Unfortunately after several mugglings, I have replaced it with a micro until I can come up with something better. 

You can park on the street, near the following coordinates: N 41° 10.378 W 096° 04.262. Google Maps Street View gives you a nice view of the sidewalk leading to this cache from this location.

In addition to the usual log, pen, pencil and trinkets, the cache also originally contains a First To Find prize. It is a trackable &quot;Cache In, Trash Out&quot; micro coin with an activation code so you can activate it and send it out as your own trackable.

A bit of history of the area:
Founded in the late 1880s, Portal was a small town which was situated on Sections 16, 17, and 21 of Township 14, Range 12. It was platted by the Portal Land and Town Lot Company and it was possibly named for the portal of the western gateway. This small railroad town was predated by a one-room school and cemetery; both of which remain. It was located along the Union Pacific Railroad, northwest of Papillion, on Giles Road, between 108th and 114th Streets. A German Methodist church, bank, newspaper office and several stores sprang up in Portal in the late 1880s. The post office was established April 23, 1887. But frequent floooding and the depression of the 1890s sapped the strength of the growing community and it faded into oblivion. The post office was discontinued August 24, 1898. Portal's peak population was twenty-five in the 1890 census, though another source cited a population of sixty at one point.

The one-room school house was moved from 114th and Giles to 242 North Jefferson in Papillion and was the site of the now archived cache &quot;Hatchet House&quot; (GC12XFB). I placed a new cache &quot;Portal School&quot; (GC2D5W7) at the same location. Portal Cemetary is located at 108th and Chandler Road and contains the cache &quot;Rest In Peace&quot; (GCTV16). The Portal Ridge neighborhood where this cache is located is just to the southeast of the former location of Portal on land that was owned by Ernest Petersen.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed in a neighborhood park in the Turtle Creek
subdivision a short walk along a paved sidewalk and mowed grass
from parking (N 41° 11.629, W 096° 3.301). Watch your step as you
approach, there is a small drainage ditch near the cache location.
The park is closed from 10pm to 6am.

As with any cache, make sure the lid is sealed tightly and rehide
the container as you found it. Please use stealth to conceal the
location from muggles. I suggest that you take the cache to the
nearby park bench or picnic shelter while you sign the log so as
not to draw any unwanted attention to the cache hiding spot. There
is playground equipment nearby, so bring the geokids to help
distract the muggles.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a replacement hide for &quot;Turtle Creek Hidey Hole&quot; (GC21PVZ).
When the tree with the Hidey Hole was cut down, I couldn't find a
similar location to replace the cache. As such, I decided to
archive the Hidey Hole and create a new hide instead. Hope you
enjoy the search...</groundspeak:long_description>

You will find a camouflaged pill bottle sized container at the posted coordinates. This is not the cache and it does NOT contain a log. You will have to figure out what to do from there. DO NOT remove this container for any reason, please. You may want to take it to your car while you work out your game plan, but replace it before you start the hunt.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is placed in Wildewood Park, a great Ralston Park with a nice walking path. The cache is a 625 foot stroll through the park from the parking lot (N 41° 11.832 W 096° 02.036). If you take the most direct route from here you will end up on the wrong side of the creek. Instead, follow the sidewalk east from the parking lot crossing the creek on the sidewalk adjacent to 78th St and then a short walk on mowed grass. The last 160 feet into the trees will be more challenging terrain.

The cache is a screw top container with room for trades, travel bugs and coins. During the warmer months, the cache hiding place can be quite overgrown, including the possibility of poisonous plants, so long pants are recommended. The mosquitos will be happy to see you as well. The terrain once you step into the woods can be very uneven, so step with caution. As with any cache, please use stealth when necessary and rehide the container where you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is a small lock-n-lock container with room for small trades, travel bugs and coins. During the warmer months, the cache hiding place can be rather overgrown, so you may want to wear long pants. There will be muggles about during baseball months, but if you use stealth, you should be able to slip into the trees without much notice. As with any cache, please rehide the container well (use some barkouflage).</groundspeak:long_description>

Ralston. You can park on 75th street just 40 feet from the cache.
Hopefully it will be a quick park and grab for you. The park is
closed from 10pm to 6am.

I don't like hiding micros, but to continue the Ralston Park
series, it will be necessary in these smaller, well manicured
parks. You are looking for a camouflaged bison tube. I came here
four times to take coordinates, and haven't run into a muggle in
the park yet, but be aware of your surroundings. There are nearby
houses, the Ralston Police Department across the park to the east,
and traffic on Main Street to deal with, so please use stealth. I
suggest sitting down on the park benches to sign the log, so you
don't draw any unwanted attention to your activities or the cache
hiding spot. Please be respectful of the landscaping and be sure to
close the container tightly. If you come when there is snow, make
extra tracks so you don't lead muggles to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am pretty confident in the coordinates, but I want this to be an
easy one... so if your GPSr doesn't have you right at the cache,
please send me your coordinates. Also, I think this one should be
handicap accessible. Let me know if you disagree.</groundspeak:long_description>

from street parking (N 41°12.425 W 96°01.993). The park is closed

The terrain near the cache is very uneven and may be quite overgrown during the warmer months, including the possibility of bothersome plants. In the case of this hide, the shortest path to the cache is probably not the best way. Uneven ground and long dropoffs into a stream would make night caching hazardous and not recommended. The park is closed from 11pm to 5am.

The cache is a screw-top container with room for trades, travel bugs and coins. As with any cache, make sure the container is well sealed and rehide the container well. Use stealth when necessary to conceal the location from muggles.

In addition to the usual log, writing tool, and trinkets, the cache also originally contains a First To Find prize. It is a trackable Micro Compass Rose tag with an activation code so you can activate it and send it out as your own trackable.</groundspeak:long_description>

don't meander too far off the geotrail. Uneven ground and long
drop-offs into a stream would make night caching hazardous and not
recommended. If you are vertically challenged, you may need someone
along to give you a boost.

The cache is a large screw top container with plenty of room for
trades, travel bugs and coins. As with any cache, make sure the
container lid is well tightened and re-camouflage the container
well. Use stealth when necessary to conceal the location from
muggles. The park is closed from 11pm to 5am.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Check out the stream this cache is hidden near on Google Maps. It
flows under &quot;L&quot; street east of this cache and meanders through
Mockingbird, disappearing as suddenly as it appeared. Pretty deep
ravine and wide stream to hide, but somehow, they did it. I wonder
where it goes from here?</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was originally filled with an FTF Pathtag and a little bit of OpenCaching.com SWAG.

Please be respectful of the neighborhood by staying on the park side of the creek.  

The cache is placed in a family friendly area but could be a little dangerous in the event of high water, so avoid after significant rain showers.

Congratulations to CdAGeoGeeks for the FTF! 

 This should be an easy drive up cache. You are looking for a &quot;decon&quot; container with a log and small trade items, room enough for small Travel Bugs or GeoCoins. Sign the logsheet and return the cache to its original spot.
This Cache replaces the one previously hidden by Dr. Horrible, but isn't as creatively placed, so you should have no problems finding it.
Upon reaching the coordinates, you should read the plaque that notes the spot that Nebraska had its first aeroplane flight. It occurred on November 21, 1910 and the flight was piloted by Charles Baysdorfer..

One of the neat things about this location is that you can almost imagine the history that took place here, since the area hasn't changed too terribly much.

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy searching for a small container near an interesting
building that is not actually part of the University of South
Dakota. This building is open 24 hours during the school year for
studying or socializing, why not take a tour while you're here? The
cache container had gone missing, but has been replaced with one a
bit smaller which contains only a log sheet &lt;i&gt;BYOP&lt;/i&gt; (bring your
own pen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The cache is not in the building, but you are welcome to a
tour while you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy finding this cache!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was placed for sentimental reasons as my family history started in and around Centerville. My Father, Aunt, and Grandparents are all 'planted' within the grounds of the cemetery. It is a beautiful place to visit and just sit back and listen to natures silence and see the South Dakota landscape.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. 

Nero Wolfe, also known as the galloping gourmet, was an armchair detective. He rarely left the house; instead his assistant, Archie Goodwin,his assistant would collect the facts and report back. Nero Wolfe would probably not have taken on many cases had he not needed the clients’ money to pay for his two true passions: fine food and the collecting of orchids. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's male secretary, prodded him into taking cases whenever the bank balance got a little low. Wolfe, as a character, is difficult to like. He's a self-assured type that does nothing unless he wants to; making his assistant, Archie Goodwin, deal with the outside world. Airing 1943–1944, 30 minutes ABC; 1946 30 Minutes MBS; 1950–1951, 30 minutes NBC; and 1982 CBC radio and was created in 1934 by Rex Stout.

To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. 

Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk. Be respectful of the area and remember to CITO.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. 

The Adventures of Philip Marlowe radio show was a private detective action series about a tough, no nonsense crime fighter.  Philip Marlowe had no sympathy for the bad guys as you can tell from this opening statement he makes at the beginning of each episode: “Get this and get it straight. Crime is a sucker’s road, and those who travel it wind up in the gutter, the prison, or the grave.” Airing in 1947-1951 it ran on NBC from June of 1947 to August 1947 and then September 1948 till September 1951, with the main sponsor being Pepsodent.

Then add a very wet spring, it is hard not to drive around and see water wherever you go. This mirco is near a bridge and there is no need to go into the water. Unless it's on the roadway. Please use stealth and BYOP. Don't forget to CITO whenever possible.

Broadcast from April 1943 to September 1952 and aired on NBC's American Blue Network. The Falcon also known as Michael Waring, solved the crimes the police were never able to solve. The Falcon was a dramatic combination of danger, romance and action. There were 70 episodes created with the Falcon played by Berry Kroger, James Megihan, and Les Tremayne. It was announced by George Petrie, Ed Herlihy and Jack Costello over its years on the air.

The new Lewis and Clark storage location is nearby and shows that country spaces are rapidly shrinking. With such large objects blocking the view, a good country song could be written. Please try to keep this area as prestine as possible, and CITO whenever possible.

            the cradle will rock.

            When the bough breaks,

            the cradle will fall,

            And down will come baby,

            cradle and all.

Thought to have been one of the first poems written on American soil. It is believed that the pilgrim who did so, was referencing how the Natives would hang their infants from tree branches. 

You aren't looking for a cradle but be careful not to break anything should you fall.</groundspeak:long_description>

Culverts we all love them. This one is no different. When placed the area stuck with stagnet water. It was hot and bugs all around. Becareful searching for this one we do not want to see anyone hurt. I noticed a new Benchmark here at this location as well so this might be a double find for thouse that do Benchmarks. Enjoy the hunt. This one in particular is a Fairly Nasty/Evil hide in my opinion. Good Luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. 

From 1949 to 1953 in radio Richard Diamond, played by David Meyer was one of the more laid back detectives, and a signing gumshoe. He started as OSS agent and then as a New York City private detective. His show would normally end with a serenade to his girlfriend Helen. During the program Detective Diamond would usually feel the butt of a gun and wake up with Lt. Levinson helping him with the case. The 30 minute show was aired weekly on NBC then to move to ABC in 1951 and CBS in 1953 and sponsored by Camel cigarettes when on ABC and Rexall on CBS. 

To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. 

Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk. Be respectful of the area and remember to CITO.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is a lot of rich history in Sioux Falls, the Washington Pavilion, the falls, downtown, and the list can go on. But sometimes the best history can be found in our own neighborhoods. The self-owned barbershop, the no name gas station, and then there is the corner pub. Where history is relived all over again with the reminiscing of a tale or two, where the truth meets the skeptical. This cache is located outside of one such pub where the Northenders have told many tales. The cache is placed with permission and should be a quick park and grab for many. There is no need to go inside for the cache and the muggles will enjoy trying to get another tale about strange people walking around in circles looking lost.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. 

Sam Spade was a spin off from The Maltese Falcon. Sam along with Lurene Tuttle as Effie Perrine, his perfect secretary and John McIntire was Lt. Dundy. He meticulously made a report on every episode as the case progressed. During each episode Effie would find out what was developing with Sam. Wise cracking and upper cutting could be possible in each of the episodes. Running on CBS until 1950 when the creator was investigated for possible Communist Ties, such was the times during the McCarthy era. The sponsor of this show was a hair care product called Wildroot Hair Oil.

To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located.

Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy.

Airing June 23, 1944 until September 15 of that year, It continued next year and adventually produced over 200 episodes for this series were produced between 1944 and October 25 1950 for NBC. Originally starting as a replacement for the Amos and Andy show, while trying to solve his cases Blackie usually had words with Police Inspector Farraday (Maurice Tarplin) Farraday’s was always there to egg on Blackie. Farraday and Blackie's relationship had less tension as time went on. Blackie dated Mary Wesley (Jan Miner), and would always come back to her at the end of the episodes.

John R. Coryell the original dime store writer of Nick Carter, known as the Master Detective and was played by Lon Clark through its run on the air.  Sponsored by Cudahy Packing and Old Dutch Cleanser and later Acme Products and Lin-X (the Johnson floor wax rival), the half hour show portrayed the gumshoe deducing the clues that were given throughout the show it ran for over 10 years, from 1943 to 1955. Helping the detective was Patsy Bowen, played by Helen Choate, his lovely assistant.  Nick always was trying to assist Sgt. Masterson the hard working homicide cop.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how geocaching has the ability to enlighten you
about your surroundings. Mrs. Gecko being from around South Dakota
has lived in many of the small towns around Sioux Falls and the
state. But there is always new opportunity to learn about where one
lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the construction season a few years ago, we had to take
the back roads to and from work. In doing so we found the quaint
little town of Ellis. It is one of those towns that if you blink
you will have already passed through. This little town was founded
in 1893 as a grain town. The Ellis &amp; Eastern railroad is based
here; running for 14.5 miles to Valley Springs to the east on the
Minnesota border. Originally named Scoopville, due to the amount of
grain that was handled and shipped all had to be moved with
‘scoop shovels’, until the grain elevators were built.
At that time the grain company’s suggested the name change to
Ellis, after the grain manager for the firm Peavey and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bridge cache is located just on the outskirts of Ellis. The
terrain rating is due to the traffic driving by. I can be very busy
and fast and times so use caution when retreiving. Due to another
cache at a nearby location this cache had to be relocated. And
there is a slight pull off nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you drive through the area you can still see a lot of the
original structures that was Ellis. There is no room for a pen and
we like when the area remains pristine. So please remember to CITO
whenever possible. Happy Caching.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. 

In Broadway’s My Beat, Danny Clover was a New York City homicide detective, his beat was Times Square to Columbus Circle. This area was referred to as the gaudiest, the most violent, and the lonesomest mile in the world.&quot; It aired February 27, 1949 through August 1, 1954 on CBS.

To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. 

Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk. Be respectful of the area and remember to CITO.</groundspeak:long_description>

this cache you must use your noodle and locate each of the nine
caches listed below to solve the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1949 and running through 1962 with only a year
hiatus from 1954-1955. Johnny Dollar was the &quot;the insurance
investigator with the action-packed expense account.&quot; His
adventures as a freelance Insurance investigator took him all
around the world in search of the truth behind the clients of the
Hartford based Universal Adjustment Bureau, a clearinghouse for the
many insurance companies. Most of his cases were to stop fraud
associated with what would be discovered as murder. As he solved
his cases he would routinely give an amount for his expense report;
Taxi ride $2.58, or .10 for a long distance phone call, usually
back to the Adjustment Bureau. During its years on the radio,
Johnny was played by no more than 8 actors. Starting with Dick
Powell was in the original audition show, but left this role for
another detective role. Charles Russell played the role from
February 1949-January 1950. The last to play the role was Mandel
Kramer who played the role from June of 1961 to September 1962.
Although this radio show did have a TV pilot in 1962, it never made
it to the screen as a series and will only forever live on along
the airways of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate this cache Johnny provided numbers from his expense
report to help locate the final coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

You are seeking a camoed decon can. The lid is not tethered so do be careful not to drop or lose it please. To keep the log dry, also make sure to snap it back on nice and firmly.

Please replace the cache container to the original location exactly as you found it, no need to make these more difficult than intended.

Sometimes worlds can meet without the inhabitants of either realizing....

The Natives, by Katherine MacLean

The old one said, &quot;Stick close by me, child.&quot;

&quot;What'll it be like, Grandpa?&quot; The youngster was frightened.

&quot;Dark, very dark, and big. It moves fast, but we'll keep up with it.&quot; The tone was consciously reassuring.

&quot;Dark, Grandpa?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it sucks heat and absorbs light. You'll find out when you're old and strong enough to swim down to the bottom and see what's there. Now stay with me when we follow it, and don't get lost in the crowd; and don't get ahead of me or get too close to it--you might take in too much, and get overcharged.&quot;

&quot;What's 'overcharged,' Grandpa? Can you really get too much?&quot; The youngster jigged up and down a little with excitement and anticipation.

For a moment, the oldster turned his attention from watching for the thing that was coming, and considered him fondly. &quot;Poor youngling. I forget. You've had no chance to learn what it means to get enough. You're too young to ride the storms and tap the lightnings.... Listen now. When a grownup has to let out a flash of blue light, that means that he's overcharged and spinning off balance inside, and so he has to save himself by letting out his energy to let down the pressure. So be careful; take enough, but don't be greedy and take in too much too suddenly. Now let's just float here with the others and be ready.&quot;

It was a beautiful bright day. The sun poured down its flood of light, here and there energizing a molecule of the blue air into little sparkles of ionization; and below, a mist of bright clouds half veiled the darkness that was the bottom.

&quot;What's it mean when someone blinks blue light in lots of flashes, and then glows red and starts sinking, huh, Grandpa?&quot;

&quot;I'll tell you later when you're older. Just be careful and don't get too close.&quot; He was abruptly excited. &quot;Here it comes!&quot;

Out of the blue translucence far below, a black dot appeared and grew rapidly, rushing closer until it was a huge fish-shaped object with widespread fins, rushing towards them. It would pass slightly to the left of them, and already the waiting crowd was moving to intercept it.

 It flashed by, and the youngster thought they were going to lose it--it was going so much faster than they; but as the thought crossed his mind, and he saw the two churning glowing openings in its rear, a burning blast of energy struck him. A multitude of glowing, charged particles crackled around him, streamed against him. His fields shifted to reach out and capture them; the spin of stored energy within spun faster, absorbing the new energy into its drive, its life-pulse rising to a deep hum, and he felt strong, stronger than he had ever felt before in his life.

They were flying faster now, accelerating faster than he had ever flown, and it was easy. They drew up closer to the dark thing, matching it speed for speed, laving in the glowing cloud of energy-particles that roared backward from its jets. The youngster was astounded and exhilarated at the tremendous, effortless speed with which they were driving forward. This was the first time he had ever had so much power. It was ten times more than any aurora borealis with its pale wash of energy waves.

Drunken in his new found strength, he pulled ahead closer to the roaring jets.

* * * * *
At the peak of the arc of climb of the New York-Istanbul stratoliner, high in the ionosphere where the Earth was merely a giant globe far below, the pilot of the stratoliner boredly cut the jets for the fuel-saving glide that turned their nose toward Earth again.

The radar was clanging its usual senseless warning of imminent collision with some solid objects, which had approached closer than the automatic relays considered safe. It had been clanging for several minutes. The pilot glanced in annoyance at the radar screen, where several hundred globes--from two to seven feet in diameter--showed vividly, trailing the ship in a fan-shaped cluster. &quot;Some day I'm going to take a hammer to that thing.&quot;

The co-pilot, looking back from the control blister's rear window, saw nothing, as usual, except a few of the shining globes, which showed themselves transiently in a brief flash of blue light as they carelessly overloaded and discharged--and one, smaller than the rest, who blinked on and off rapidly in brilliant flashes of blue. As he watched, it ran suddenly down the color-scale to red and began to lag behind, a glowing red globe, sinking.

 &quot;I wonder what the hell they think they're doing?&quot; he grumbled.

This particular bridge at the time the cache was placed had several swallows nesting at it. So depending on the time of the year, be careful of dive bombing birds. The additional challenge for this cache will be that container is located somewhere on the bridge and is not at the specified coordinates. 

Please place the container as you found it.

You are seeking a camoed decon can. The lid is not tethered so do be careful not to drop or lose it please. To keep the log dry, also make sure to snap it back on nice and firmly.

There will be muggles at times during sports activities. Please use caution and stealth, If you have Jedi mind tricks at your disposal, this would be a good time to use them.

Not enough room for a writing utensil so BYOP. Above all, have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">first there is a small pull off near the cache.

Standing on a winding road somewhere in West Virginia you see an innocent looking group of people. Walking down the middle of the road, just as you get use to this sight you hear the familiar call &quot;Bowling!&quot;. The next thing you see is a running person hurling what appears to be a small metal cannon ball being thrown down the road in a bowling ball fasion. As the object bounces it's way down the road, only coming to a sudden stop somewhere off in the ditch. You then hear a call in the distance &quot;Car!&quot; No, they do not stop traffic to do this sport. Irish Road bowling was born in, well you guessed it Ireland. It has since grown in popularity and has traveled to the United States. 

Played with a 28 ounce iron and steel cannonball around the size of a tennis ball or croquet ball, the bowlers will attempt to get as few throws to the finish line which is apporoximatley a mile and a half over winding roads. The cache you are looking for will be a P&amp;G for most, but this road reminds me of many of my experiances bowling with our family in WV. Enjoy the cache, and if intereseted we can bowl sometime.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is Baltic's newest park and there should be no need to tear anything apart to get this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kim and I were in the Fergus Falls area this past weekend visiting family, friends and checking on a farm I own northwest of Fergus and thought we would place a few new caches in the area while here on this visit. These will be our first caches in this area and we both hope you'll enjoy them. This will be our 158th cache hidden and yes this one should be winter friendly as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache takes you just north/northwest of the downtown area to a small park where there is a lot of action throughout the week. Watch for muggles as you hunt for this cache. NOTE: You will need to bring your own pencil to log your visit at this cache.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you did.))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGAIN,,, PLEASE WATCH FOR MUGGLERS IN THIS AREA!</groundspeak:long_description>

You might require a tool to extract the container. Please return as you found it.

This is a toughy as far as the terrain goes. If your are not real sure-footed this cache is probably not going to be for you? When approching this cache in the summer months you might want to park at the listed park cords, if visiting this cache in the winter months park where the plowing ends and walk the short distance to the cache. Might want to watch for muggles during the summer months as this tends to be a very busy area at that time?

Good Luck &amp; Have Fun and be careful!!

Congratulations to 4voorts for FTF. 

This cache and contents was given to the youngest of the seekandfinderz clan for his 9th birthday by our geocaching friends ml3singers. He went over to their home and with gps in hand went on the search for his birthday gift in their backyard. What a great idea and lots of fun!
 
We've hidden the ammo box container close to our summer retreat.
 
FTF certificate and seed cache containers for FTF, 2TF, 3TF and 4TF.
 
Contains lots of tradeables and initial cache content:
 * Insect case
 * Extendable light clip
 * Metal magic spring
 * Sweetheart necklace
 * Multifunction keychain
 * Pencils
 * Stickers
 * Kleenex packs
 * Eyeglass repair kit
 * Canada 50$ playing cards
 * ROCK dog tag necklace
 
We've also placed inside our very first Travel Bug: Mario on the Move.
 
Hope you have fun caching in this lovely cottage country area!
