The yellow color made its debut in the Peanut Chocolate M&amp;M back in 1960 together with the red and green colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background Information&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd in the M&amp;M Mysteries series. The first (Blue) was setup in a mountain, this one at the beach. Think of Palms, huts and seafood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be taken to the beautiful El Uverito beach near Las Tablas, Los Santos, PANAMA. The cach√© is hidden above you on a place you would normally relax with a view of the beach, close enough to get your feet burnt by the hot sands, close enough to fresh (non-clorinated) water. A lighthouse will be on your back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Container&lt;br/&gt;A yellow M&amp;M canister which is small and thus like a microcache. Bring your own pen/pencil! it only has a log book and an instruction leaflet. Make sure to place it back so that it cannot be seen by the regular visitors using the hut. Should you need wrapping material to hide it better, you can cut it out from any of the coconut palms nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Sit up and relax but look up. Container is about 2 meters from the ground.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Snowden's used to be a little store in the area that would sell liquor to anybody, any age, maaaaany years ago.  It was a popular place, and fortunately for us responsible parents, it's no longer there!  Nowadays when people talk about Snowden's, they are referring to the bridge that is a popular place for kids to hang out in the summer time.  Of course, jumping off the bridge is illegal, so the cops are always running the kids off.  The county has now made a small parking area for people who want to fish or just hang out and look at the bay.</groundspeak:long_description>

Back on January 29, 2008, I found this cache, as it is cross-listed at both websites.  Soooooo...I'm claiming my Found It for this cache.  

As I'm the first to claim the find, I guess I've got the FTF...for now.  But I'm sure that someone else who has found it in the past will eventually put in their claim and beat me out.  Time travel sure is swell!!  :-)

I rate this one a 2.5 difficulty because it took me two tries to find it.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Okay, I'm a regular at www.geocaching.com, but saw OpenCaching.com mentioned in a Miami Herald article a month or two ago.  Checked out the website and saw that there were three caches offering through OpenCaching.  One of them...JAM At Snowden's...I found years ago as it is also cross-published at geocaching.com.  The second, listed as &quot;Urban Naptime 1&quot;, cannot possibly be right, because it lists as in a park but the coordinates bring you to a parking lot. 

And then there's &quot;Naptime in the Jungle&quot;, which leads to Matheson Hammock Park.  My family decided to have a &quot;family day&quot; there today, so I figured I'd check to see if this cache, published on November 7 2010 but never listed as having been found, was indeed still there.  My son and I spent four or five minutes looking at the posted coordinates and, to my surprise, it is indeed still there!!  :-)  (Oddly, the log indicates that THIS one is called &quot;Urban Naptime&quot;.....)

There HAVE been two other groups of cachers who have found it, both in 2011.  Neither has claimed their find here on OpenCaching.com...I suspect they were families that just stumbled across the cache and were gracious enough to leave it there.  We signed the log, replaced it as found...and now are here logging the first Found It!  So, for NOW, I guess we have the honor of having the FTF on this cache, unless either of the muggles who stumbled across it come on to stake their rightful claims!

We used to ride our bikes up and down the hills and spend most of our time off the ground, up in the trees. If you look hard enough in some of the trees you may even see my initials, which I carved many, many years ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will not find this cache if you keep your feet on the floor. So, if you are afriad of heights I would suggest that you bring along a buddy who can help you with the dirty work. You do not need to climb to the top; however, you will need to go up a bit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I chose the attribute &quot;Difficut Climb&quot; just to specify that climbing was nessecary. No gear is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is small... large enough for small trade items and TBS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be safe!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Eight Legged Freaks is a 2002 comedy horror directed by Ellory Elkayem and stars David Arquette, Kari W√ºhrer and Scott Terra. The plot concerns a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. The film was dedicated to the memory of Pilar Seurat, the mother of producer Dean Devlin, who died of cancer the previous year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the quiet mining town of Prosperity, Arizona, an accident involving a rabbit causes a barrel of toxic waste to land in a reservoir. An exotic spider farmer named Joshua (Tom Noonan) has been making regular visits to the site, where he collects crickets for his spiders. Although the spiders have ingested the toxins, he is oblivious since the arachnids seem unaffected. Joshua shows Mike (Scott Terra), a local boy, his collection, which include Jumping spiders, Trapdoor spiders, Tarantulas, and Orb-weaver spiders, including a female named Consuela. After Mike leaves, Joshua is bitten by an escaped tarantula and accidentally knocks down the spider cages. He is killed by the spiders and, after devouring him, the spiders grow to even huger proportions. His pet parrot is also presumed killed, when a tarantula grabs on to its head. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his way home, Mike is accosted by his mother, Sheriff Sam Stroud (Kari W√ºhrer) and Deputy Pete pulling the toxic barrel out of the pond. Wade, the Mayor of Prosperity, is holding a town meeting in the mall about whether they should sell the mines and relocate. Chris McCormick (David Arquette), whose father owned the mines before he died ten years ago, shows up and stands against Wade's proposition. Chris also sparks a romance with Sam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Meanwhile, Harlan Griffiths (Doug E. Doug), an eccentric extraterrestrial enthusiast, is broadcasting his theory that various missing pets around town have been abducted by extraterrestrials. Inevitably his theory is dismissed as the product of a deranged imagination. Mike sneaks out on foot and finds Joshua and the spiders missing, the farm covered in webbing, and the dead body of Joshua. Although he sees an enormous spider shadow in the mines and tells Chris that the spiders have grown to enormous sizes, based on a giant spider leg he found at the mine entrance, Chris disbelieves his story. Meanwhile, the mines have reopened with the miners searching for a famous gold lode. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One miner is eaten by a gigantic spider, whose clan have made the mines their home. Seeing as the entire town is connected in some way to the mines, spiders show up in many different places. Deputy Pete Williams (Rick Overton) cat has a fight with one of the spiders in the air vents before being eaten and some of the ostriches on Wade's farm are devoured by Trap Door Spiders, Ashley breaks up with her boyfriend Bret, and he and his motorcyclist friends are chased by jumping spiders, with him being the only survivor, accidentally cutting off the telephone line and being stuck in the mine. Chris finds out that his Aunt Gladys and her dog are abducted by a male orb weaver in their basement. Sam is convinced Chris and Mike are delusional. However, her skepticism fades and she realizes that Chris and Mike were right all along when she witnesses a giant male orb-weaver attempting to abduct Ashley (Scarlett Johansson), her daughter and Chris; Sam saves them both. Meanwhile Bret, still wandering the mines, gets a good peek at the giant Consuela during her feeding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sam contacts Pete and tells him to bring all guns in the police station's possession and they escape to Harlan's trailer, knowing he has a radio station that he operates from within his trailer. As Sam broadcasts the threat over the radio, a giant tarantula, the &quot;tank&quot; of the horde, assaults the trailer but they manage to escape. As the town is besieged by vicious spider hordes, many people are eaten, Chris tries to convince Harlan that the spiders are &quot;from Earth&quot; but ends up convincing him that they are &quot;Spiders from Mars&quot; to make him happy, Sam tells everybody to evacuate to the mall. Chris, Sam, Mike, Ashley, Harlan, Wade and many other townspeople all escape and barricade themselves in the mall (but Wade flees into the mines and locks the gate before the attack) and defend themselves from the spiders. Meanwhile, Harlan and Chris climb onto the roof and ascend the radio mast and try to get a signal to call the army as they are being attacked by the spiders, but are believed to be pranksters. Harlan jumps from the roof, after the tarantula breaks open the gates and lets the spiders enter the mall, and lands in some bushes, where he meets up with Pete. The two run from spiders as Chris meets up with the remaining townsfolk and goes down to the basement. Meanwhile Bret, still wandering the mines, encounters the cowardly Wade before his abduction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the townsfolk are in the basement, Bret arrives on a forklift that brings down the locked gate, and they all head to through the mines straight to the front entrance, discovering the methane-filled tunnels. After losing Norman and freeing Wade, Chris goes to look for his Aunt Gladys in the mines and finds her and the gold his father was searching for, but is confronted by the gigantic Consuela. He uses perfume to distract the spider and the escapes using Bret's motorcycle. Chris then blows up the spiders and the mines utilizing Gladys's smoking addiction and the high concentrations of methane gas. The police finally arrive. They had not believed the reports of the spiders but believed Harlarn's theory that the assailants were extraterrestrial in nature, until Pete tells them that the assailants were &quot;just spiders, that had ingested extremely high levels of toxic waste.&quot; He tries to show this is true by showing his head, thinking (since it was exposed to the toxic waste) that his hair grew back, but unfortunately it did not. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the story ends, Harlan is heard making a radio report about the spiders. He concludes that the town has decided to cover up the whole incident, but have let Harlan continue broadcasting the incident, knowing nobody will believe him. He also mentions Chris reopening the gold mines and putting everyone back to work, but tells us &quot;that is another story altogether.&quot; As the camera zooms in close on his mouth, it is clear that he now has three gold teeth.</groundspeak:long_description>

Oh the ettiquet questions! Do I go back &amp; sign the log twice!? Surely not.  What about trackables? 
For now I will leave the big questions like this for later and log this as my first official opencaching.com find.  I'll have to check and see what other caches i've already been to. ;)

I only rated it &quot;5&quot; because you need a boat or kayak to get there! But once you are on the island, it's not hard to find. There are nice picnic areas too... While your there practice some CITO, there are plenty of trash cans in the area as well. Be careful not to run into one of the many spiderwebs! I recommend wearing long pants because the area is slightly overgrown and there are plants that do &quot;bite&quot;, sort of....</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, since I've completed the area bushwhacker series, I was told
I could put my own out so here you go..... The cache is in a county
nature area and parking is OK across the street at the shopping
center. The Loxahatchee Slough nature area is FOOT TRAFFIC ONLY,
but I recommend a hiking stick, water and snacks.
&lt;p&gt;So more about the cache....there is a long dry way and a short
wet way...I've given you a choice and you'll always have a
choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While walking to this one, I spotted several types of animal
tracks which included deer,hog and otter. No gators, but they're
out there. Even came across several hog wallows. Great bird
gatherings in the area so bring your camera. The picture describes
the area...yeah right,keep telling yourself this....&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It has white on its throat, around its eyes and&lt;br/&gt;nose, on its stomach and on the underside of its tail. The male has&lt;br/&gt;antlers. Males weigh between 150 and 300 pounds and females weigh&lt;br/&gt;between 90 to 200 pounds. White-tailed deer can be found in&lt;br/&gt;southern Canada and most of the United States, except for the&lt;br/&gt;Southwest, Alaska and Hawaii. A deer's home range is usually less&lt;br/&gt;the a square mile. Deer collect in family groups of a mother and&lt;br/&gt;her fawns. When a doe has no fawns, she is usually solitary. Male&lt;br/&gt;bucks may live in groups consisting of three or four individuals,&lt;br/&gt;except in mating season, when they are solitary.The white-tailed&lt;br/&gt;deer lives in wooded areas. In some areas, deer overpopulation is a&lt;br/&gt;problem. Gray wolves and mountain lions used to be predators of the&lt;br/&gt;white-tailed deer and helped keep their population under control.&lt;br/&gt;But because of hunting and human development, there are not very&lt;br/&gt;many wolves and mountain lions left in some parts of North America.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a bobcat or a coyote will kill a young deer, but people&lt;br/&gt;and dogs are now the deer's main predator. Because there are not&lt;br/&gt;many natural predators, deer populations can sometimes grow too&lt;br/&gt;large for their environment and deer can starve to death. In rural&lt;br/&gt;areas, hunters help control deer populations, but in suburban and&lt;br/&gt;urban areas hunting is often not allowed and deer populations can&lt;br/&gt;grow out of control. Other things can change deer populations.&lt;br/&gt;Disease and parasites like lice, mites and roundworms can weaken or&lt;br/&gt;kill deer. Young deer and old deer often get sick and die,&lt;br/&gt;especially in the winter. Winter is a dangerous time for deer.&lt;br/&gt;Their long narrow legs and pointed hooves make it hard for them to&lt;br/&gt;move around in the snow and ice and it is easier for predators like&lt;br/&gt;dogs to catch them. The white-tailed deer is an herbivore or plant&lt;br/&gt;eater. It follows well-used trails to its feeding areas. It feeds&lt;br/&gt;in the early morning hours and in the late afternoon. A deer's diet&lt;br/&gt;changes depending on its habitat and the season. It eats green&lt;br/&gt;plants in the spring and summer. In the fall, it eats corn, acorns&lt;br/&gt;and other nuts. In the winter, it eats the buds and twigs of woody&lt;br/&gt;plants. The white-tailed deer is a ruminant. Its stomach has four&lt;br/&gt;chambers for digesting food. In the first two chambers, the rumen&lt;br/&gt;and the reticulum, food is mixed with bile to form the cud. The cud&lt;br/&gt;is regurgitated and re-chewed and swallowed. It passes through the&lt;br/&gt;rumen to the omasum where water is removed. Finally, the food&lt;br/&gt;enters the last chamber, the abomasum, where it is sent on to the&lt;br/&gt;small intestine where the nutrients in the food are absorbed. This&lt;br/&gt;digestive system lets the white-tailed deer eat foods like woody&lt;br/&gt;plants that other animals can't digest! If deer have enough food,&lt;br/&gt;water and shelter, their population can grow very quickly. Cows,&lt;br/&gt;bison, bighorn sheep, goats, llamas, camels and giraffes are also&lt;br/&gt;ruminants. White-tailed deer mate in November in the northern parts&lt;br/&gt;of their range and in January or February in the southern parts of&lt;br/&gt;their range. The female has one to three fawns after about six&lt;br/&gt;months after mating. Fawns are reddish-brown at birth with white&lt;br/&gt;spots that help camouflage them. They can walk at birth and forage&lt;br/&gt;for food a couple of days later. They are weaned at about six&lt;br/&gt;weeks. The mother leaves her fawns well-hidden for hours at a time&lt;br/&gt;while she feeds. If she has more than one fawn, she hides them in&lt;br/&gt;separate places. While they are waiting for their mother to return,&lt;br/&gt;the fawns lay on the ground with their heads and necks stretched&lt;br/&gt;out flat on the ground. This makes it harder for predators to find&lt;br/&gt;them. Female fawns may stay with their mother for two years, males&lt;br/&gt;usually leave after a year. When a white-tailed deer is alarmed, it&lt;br/&gt;may stomp its hooves and snort to warn other deer. It may also&lt;br/&gt;&quot;flag&quot; or raise its tail and show its white underside. When a&lt;br/&gt;mother deer is running, this white underside can help her fawns&lt;br/&gt;follow her. White-tailed deer are very good runners. They can run&lt;br/&gt;at speeds of up to 30 mile an hour. They are also good leapers and&lt;br/&gt;swimmers This information has everything to do with the cache which&lt;br/&gt;is located in the &quot;Pine Glades Nature area&quot; I've hiked here before&lt;br/&gt;and there's another cache about a mile in from this one. For extra&lt;br/&gt;credit and to see if your paying attention, email me at &quot;brasseur438@yahoo.com&quot; with the&lt;br/&gt;number of points on the antlers on the geocache. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can anyone geocache in northern Palm Beach County for long
and not know these names, that of Bonsairad as mentioned by Zeke or
rangergirl141 who gets the STF. Thank you all for your caches I
have found along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to note that this was the first find of a cache I own and
the day of my 100th find. Mrs Egger and I did not know about my
cache being found when we the started out in Tequesta heading south
on US 1 toward PGA Blvd to find 4 caches I needed to get to 100. It
was not until I was entering them that I realized that rngirl owned
my finds #97, #98, and #99. It was by plan that number my #100 is
owned by Bonsairad as was my first find. &lt;strong&gt;Thanks to all
again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Specialist. Please remember to pull all wheels off the road when
Parking. Do not block any gates or trail heads and follow posted
speed limits. I actually was able to meet Randy Mantooth while
attending a local Firefighter Rehap class recently...one of the
highlights of my career in the fire service now that I'm retired.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The show focuses on paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto (played by
Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe) of the Los Angeles County Fire
Department's Station 51 (actually Station 127 in Carson,
California), and the hospital emergency room staff Dr. Kelly
Brackett, Nurse Dixie McCall and Dr. Joe Early (acted out by,
respectively, Robert Fuller, Julie London and Bobby Troup) with
whom the paramedics work to save lives. It was also the first show
to feature paramedics who help rescue victimized or hurt
patients.The show highlighted the adventures of the then-fledgling
paramedic program, and its popularity coincided with (and may have
encouraged) the widespread establishment and improvement of
emergency medical services paramedic programs across North America
in the middle and late 1970s. Los Angeles County was one of the
first communities‚Äîalong with Columbus, Ohio, Miami,
Pittsburgh and Seattle to start a paramedic program in connection
with the fire department between 1969 and 1971. The show was also
credited for demonstrating first aid techniques that enabled some
viewers to save lives in real medical emergencies. When the medical
community saw that the general public were using First Aid and CPR
in response to this show, they started the teaching programs for
CPR in every state. However, the show later had to add a disclaimer
stating that the first aid techniques demonstrated should only be
performed by trained persons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actual local disasters were worked into some story lines, such as
the 1971 Sylmar earthquake which destroyed the newly-completed
Olive View Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley; and a 1973
brush fire on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;All of Team KrumBen's caches in the Okeechobee area are dedicated to the Shaw Clan, whose logs always make us laugh.&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A major theme in Oh Brother Where Art Thou? is the connection between old-time music and political campaigning in the southern U.S. It makes reference to the traditions, institutions, and campaign practices of bossism and political reform that defined Southern politics in the first half of the twentieth century. The Ku Klux Klan, at the time a political force of white populism, is depicted burning crosses and engaging in ceremonial dance.&lt;br /&gt;
The character of Menelaus &quot;Pappy&quot; O'Daniel, the Governor of Mississippi and host of the radio show &quot;The Flour Hour,&quot; is similar in name and demeanor to W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O'Daniel,[22] one-time Governor of Texas and later U.S. Senator from that state.[23] W. Lee O'Daniel was in the flour business, and used a backing band called the Light Crust Doughboys on his radio show.[24] In one campaign, W. Lee O'Daniel carried a broom,[25] an oft-used campaign device in the reform era, promising to sweep away patronage and corruption.[25] His theme song had the hook &quot;Please pass the biscuits, Pappy,&quot; emphasizing his connection with flour.[26]) and Homer Stokes, as the challenger to the incumbent O'Daniel, portrays himself as the &quot;reform candidate,&quot; using a broom as a prop.</groundspeak:long_description>

Boating is allowed with rigid hull vessels only (no inflatables) and no motors. There is no boat ramp, so your canoe or kayak (or lightweight rowboat) must be hand launched. Swimming is not allowed. Bicycles are allowed, but you'll encounter several narrow pedestrian bypasses around the locked vehicle gates, &amp; these may be difficult to negotiate with a bike. Dogs are allowed, but must be on a leash. Fishing is allowed from the shore only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail is well-defined except for a small section at the far end of the pond. Travelling in a counter-clockwise direction is the easiest way to traverse this short (1/10th mile) overgrown area, with the additional benefit of having the easiest walking at the end of the hike. Those with mobility issues can travel clockwise from parking along a 1.3 mile grassy levee which is wide, smooth, and well-maintained, then backtrack to parking.  The levee is high enough that it should remain dry year-round, but the rest of the trail is lower &amp; could become flooded when water levels rise &amp; it is not as well maintained, though improvements are planned when additional funding is realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;1023EYD - Park&lt;br/&gt;N 27¬∞ 14.980 W 080¬∞ 24.541</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This series of caches is based on Krum's #2 movie of all time, Oh Brother Where Art Thou. The movie is rife with allusions to The Odyssey while it also references real southern celebrities (some notorious) of the early 1900s. W. Lee ‚ÄúPappy‚Äù O‚ÄôDaniel served as Texas governor and United States senator.&lt;br /&gt;
Born in 1890 in Ohio, O‚ÄôDaniel came to Texas at age 29 as a sales manager for Burrus Mills, a flour-milling company in Fort Worth. In 1928, O‚ÄôDaniel took over the company‚Äôs radio advertising and started a country music program to promote the flour. O‚ÄôDaniel hosted the show and organized a band called the Light Crust Doughboys. Many of the musicians who made Western Swing famous, including Bob Wills, got their start in O‚ÄôDaniel‚Äôs band.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1935 he organized his own flour company to make ‚ÄúHillbilly Flour‚Äù and began to call his band the Hillbilly Boys. The slogan, ‚ÄúPass the biscuits, Pappy,‚Äù made O‚ÄôDaniel a household name throughout Texas. Radio fans urged ‚ÄúPappy‚Äù to run for governor, and in 1938 he did. He attracted huge crowds, ran on a platform of the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and won the election by a landslide. Unfortunately, O‚ÄôDaniel possessed almost no qualifications for success in the governorship, and accomplished little of the agenda he had promised the people of Texas. He ushered in an era of censorship and limits on academic freedom at the University of Texas by his appointments to the Board of Regents. But despite his obvious shortcomings as a leader, he remained very popular due to his masterful radio showmanship.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1941, O‚ÄôDaniel won election to the United States Senate in one of the most controversial elections in Texas history, edging out Congressman Lyndon Baines Johnson by only a handful of votes. O‚ÄôDaniel was ineffective in the Senate and was shunned by his more serious colleagues. With his popularity finally on the wane, he did not seek reelection in 1948. In later years, O‚ÄôDaniel was active in business and made two comeback attempts at the governorship, basing his campaigns on crude appeals to anti-communist and anti-civil rights feeling. But time had passed Pappy by and he attracted few votes. He died in 1969.&lt;br /&gt;
The character of Mississippi governor Menelaus ‚ÄúPappy‚Äù O‚ÄôDaniel, played by Charles Durning in the film ‚ÄúO Brother, Where Art Thou?‚Äù is loosely based on the real W. Lee ‚ÄúPappy‚Äù O‚ÄôDaniel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;All of Team KrumBen's caches in the Okeechobee area are dedicated to the Shaw Clan, whose logs always make us laugh.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Boating is allowed with rigid hull vessels only (no inflatables) and no motors. There is no boat ramp, so your canoe or kayak (or lightweight rowboat) must be hand launched. Swimming is not allowed. Bicycles are allowed, but you'll encounter several narrow pedestrian bypasses around the locked vehicle gates, &amp; these may be difficult to negotiate with a bike. Dogs are allowed, but must be on a leash. Fishing is allowed from the shore only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail is well-defined except for a small section at the far end of the pond. Travelling in a counter-clockwise direction is the easiest way to traverse this short (1/10th mile) overgrown area, with the additional benefit of having the easiest walking at the end of the hike. Those with mobility issues can travel clockwise from parking along a 1.3 mile grassy levee which is wide, smooth, and well-maintained, then backtrack to parking.  The levee is high enough that it should remain dry year-round, but the rest of the trail is lower &amp; could become flooded when water levels rise &amp; it is not as well maintained, though improvements are planned when additional funding is realized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;P123EXG - Park&lt;br/&gt;N 27¬∞ 14.980 W 080¬∞ 24.541</groundspeak:long_description>

The movie is rife with allusions to The Odyssey while referencing real, mostly notorious, southern celebrities of the early 1900s.&lt;br/&gt;All of Team KrumBen's caches in the Okeechobee area are dedicated to the Shaw Clan, whose logs always make us laugh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Dan Teague!

Among the many encounters they have, is a mugging by a one-eyed Bible salesman named Big Dan Teague (John Goodman).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think that Dan may have had a better life if he corrected his vision problems.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's been about a year now since we've joined the best hunt in the world. While the first cache we found was in Oak Hammock Park, I'm sure we would not have continued were it not for BillyPilot and his plethora of Port St. Lucie hides.  One set in particular, the Cache Depot series, was located just a stone's throw from our house and four of those hides were among our first ten caches.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've taken some well-deserved ribbing from the local caching community over the past year for our lack of geosense and tools for caching - a smart phone and just recently, a 13-year-old Magellan.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What our caching friends don't know, and God help me if they read this, is that we cached with the very bottom of the line Garmin snap-to-road dashboard GPS for a few weeks that sent us running in all directions with little to show for it.  One of the Depot caches sent that ridiculous Garmin a quarter of a mile down the road.  Good memories.  Thanks BillyPilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There you have it.  Call us sentimental, but we're not about to let this memorable series go just yet.  We're dedicating this new cache to BillyPilot and the recently archived Cache Depot series.  It sits in the same location as one of his caches.  Which one?  That's for you to discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a camouflaged ammo can chock full of stuff and things and travel bugs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to HF3 for their First FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

Scientists have estimated the length of this herbivore to be about 30 feet long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anklyosaurus's large tail knobs could generate sufficient force to break bone on impact.

Tradition Tower &amp;
Footbridge



This is an enjoyable walk. Fine for
strollers, pets, and kids. Bring a camera too. You're looking for a
micro cache with a log only, so don't walk all that way just to
find you've forgotten your pen (been there, done that).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please don't try a P&amp;G. It's too dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We've always been disappointed that we couldn't traverse the
bridge. However, you'll find a telephone number on the gate for
those who are interested in gaining access.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you all for your feedback. I've increased the difficulty
level based on your comments. I hate to disappoint the
seekers.


And the FTF goes to
RdDrgn22!

Tradition Children's
Fountain



This cache is located next to the
children's fountain in Tradition. If you're traveling north or
south on 95 with young children, pull out the bathing suits and
towels. Clean public restrooms are next to the fountain as are
tables for relaxing, picnicking, etc. Restaurants,supermarket, and
shopping are nearby as well.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a micro containing a log only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you log a DNF, please feel free to contact us for additional
hints.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


And the FTF goes to BONSAIRAD
because rcman98 and cjb98 neglected to sign the log! Well

They lived during the Late Jurassic period in what is now western North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large, heavily built, herbivore, Stegosaurus had a distinctive and unusual posture, with a heavily rounded back, short forelimbs, head held low to the ground and a stiffened tail held high in the air. Its array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation. The spikes and plates were most likely used for defense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an armchair paleontologist, this is Ben's real passion.

&lt;p&gt;Please don't disturb our toothy little girl! You're more likely to see her in the afternoon on warm days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of August 10, 2011, she's about 4' long. If the soft-shells are sunning on the shore, you know she's lurking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her predecessors from 2009 to 2010 were much bigger, so enjoy our diminutive little girl...this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not recommend this search at night as the bank can be steep and slippery. Watch your footing, but this cache is high on the bank.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From top to bottom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wally, 2009&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mama, 2010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Queen Barbara, 2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Prettiest Natural Park in Western Port St. Lucie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oak Hammock is a 48-acre park in western Port St. Lucie. They're open from 7 a.m. to dusk (Manned from 7 a.m. to noon weekdays and 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekends)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some of the amenities include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C-24 canal boat ramp with floating dock (west of spillway; no river or ocean access)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One large pavilion (36 feet by 20 feet) with three 6-foot tables and one 8-foot table, water, electricity and one large grill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fenced play area with benches, ages 2‚Äì12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twelve car/trailer spaces and car parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two fishing piers, one with fish cleaning station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking, bicycling and dog walking (on leash in designated areas along C-24 canal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butterfly garden and approximately three miles of walking trails through large oak and palm hammocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Established 2000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Martin County's Infamous Deputy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woods of Oak Hammock come with a dark and murky past. Back in January of 1973, serial killer Gerard Shaefer murdered two girls in the park. While he wasn‚Äôt charged with the murders of Colette Goodenough and Barbara Ann Wilcox, whose remains were not discovered until January of 1977, items belonging to the girls were found in his home. He was in the habit of keeping small reminders of his victims. In this case he kept Barbara's driver's license and Collette's passport, her diary, and a book of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Two Who Got Away&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July of 1972 Shaefer kidnapped two girls and took them to Hutchinson Island where they were also bound, gagged, and suspended in nooses. When he left the area, they slipped out of the bindings and got away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lost his job as a deputy of Martin County and was arrested by the very man he worked for, Sheriff Crowder. He maintained that he was trying to teach the girls a lesson for hitchhiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaefer was sentenced to 1 year in prison and 3 months probation in December of 1972. He entered prison on January 15th. In those few short weeks after sentencing and before entering prison, Shaefer kidnapped and murdered Colette and Barbara Ann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His prison sentence lasted 6 months; he was released early for good behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cache&lt;/h3&gt;
Due to another cache's proximity to the trees, I'm unable to get closer, but I've provided the coords and pictures of both trees so you know what you're looking for. While you are looking for a pico cache, the host container is much larger. However, you still need to bring your own pen. This may change in the near future as the host can certainly hold more. &lt;b&gt;Please let us know what you think of the container. We tried to keep in mind the park's history, natural beauty, and creep factor. We hope we've achieved all three.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This 11-foot-long dinosaur lived during the early Cretaceous Period. Paleontologist John Ostrom's study of Deinonychus in the late 1960s revolutionized the way scientists thought about dinosaurs, leading to the &quot;dinosaur renaissance&quot; and igniting the debate on whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold blooded. Before this, the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an armchair paleontologist, this is Ben's real obsession.

There's no room for a pen, but I hope you enjoy the hunt. &lt;br/&gt;I had to replace the container.  This is the third container for this location.  The first was difficult, the second was easier.

The movie is rife with allusions to The Odyssey while referencing real, mostly notorious, southern celebrities of the early 1900s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When asked why he was at a crossroad in the middle of nowhere, he reveals that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. Tommy describes the devil as being &quot;White, as white as you folks ... with empty eyes and a big hollow voice. He love to travel around with a mean old hound&quot;. This description just so happens to match Sheriff Cooley, the policeman who is pursuing the trio. &lt;b&gt;All of Team KrumBen's caches in the Okeechobee area are dedicated to the Shaw Clan, whose logs always make us laugh.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tyrannosaurus Rex (meaning &quot;tyrant lizard&quot; in Greek or &quot;King&quot; in Latin, lived during the late Cretaceous Period. Sixty-five million years ago, a city-size asteroid slammed into what is now Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula at a site known as Chicxulub (pronounced CHEEK-shoo-loob). The impact left a crater 110 to 170 miles (180 to 280 kilometers) wide and spewed massive volumes of ash into Earth's atmosphere. Was this the end for T-Rex. Many say yes, others say no.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tyrannosaurus Rex was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest known land predators, measuring up to 42 feet in length, 13 feet tall at the hips, and up to 7.5 tons in weight. Was he the apex predator or simply a vulture who scavenged for prehistoric road-kill?  The debate over Tyrannosaurus as apex predator or scavenger is among the longest running in paleontology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an armchair paleontologist, this is Ben's real obsession. You're looking for a pico that lives inside the host container, so bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John&amp;Jelene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Groupertoes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;











&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄúNot the Log‚Äù cache is not as simple as it may seem. Yes, it could be a P&amp;G, but to most it won't be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There‚Äôs nothing more disappointing than finding the cache but not finding the log, so I‚Äôve left a ‚ÄúNot-the-Log‚Äù log for you to sign. Post your find online and grab that smiley. However, your name will NOT be added to the ‚ÄúNot the Log‚Äôs Caching Elite‚Äù list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make the cut and have your name added to the top of the page, you‚Äôll have to locate the real log, find the code word written on the back of it, and email it to me. Only then will you make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find the real log, &lt;b&gt;DO NOT mention the code word in your post&lt;/b&gt; for others to see. You are one of the elite - bask in the glory, knowing you are a geocaching hero, one who stands out among the rest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;In closing, I leave you with a link to a song associated with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/0OxJwsKN8wk&quot;&gt;Favorite Marvel Hero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This is the southern end of Commerce Centre Drive, and it runs from St. Lucie West Boulevard in the north to Crosstown Parkway in the south. With sidewalks along the way, this is an easy traverse where only a few of the caches require minor bushwhacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a micro cache with a log only.  You're on stage for the muggles especially at rush hour.  Silly stealth required.</groundspeak:long_description>

A stone's throw from Crosstown Pkwy, there's an apron and access road, but it's not paved and full of ruts.  It's not maintained and could cause problems for smaller vehicles. The road is mostly used by farmers in the area. A very close alternate parking waypoint is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This may be a micro cache, but there's more to it than that. &lt;br/&gt;Do not pull out or remove the cache container's host from its location. Just unscrew the top.

This is the southern end of Commerce Centre Drive, and it runs from St. Lucie West Boulevard in the north to Crosstown Parkway in the south. With sidewalks along the way, this is an easy traverse where only a few of the caches require minor bushwhacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What garden or compost would be complete without worms? Maggot-like fly larvae are of wide importance in ecology.  Various species are prominent in recycling carrion and garbage that help make a garden grow. &lt;br/&gt;As with other containers in this series, you're looking for a garden-themed cache with a log, marker &amp; small items. It never hurts to carry a wrench too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, if you know what that thing was used for, 'cause we don't, please let us know.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There was a weekend, not too long ago, where we frequently pulled over to usher along or pick up and relocate gopher turtles. On one occasion, while waiting at the light on the south side of the St. Lucie West/California intersection, we watched a juvenile turtle traveling west on St. Lucie West.  Thankfully, he did have the right of way - at that time.  &lt;br/&gt;When permitted, we sped across the intersection, looped around very quickly and snatched him up just before the light turned green again. &lt;br/&gt;After much consideration we decided to take him further north to Lake Whitney, a small lake surrounded by a fire station, church, Walmart, and an office complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note: because of the exceptionally heavy traffic, we relocated the turtle to what we determined to be the closest, safe location with a habitat suitable for gopher turtles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best access to this cache is through the Lake Whitney office park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a micro container. It contains a log.  Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you log a DNF, feel free to contact us for additional hints.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Mysterious Island is a novel by Jules Verne, published in 1874. During the Civil War, five Union prisoners of war escape captivity by hi-jacking a hot-air balloon.  They crash on a volcanic island, battle pirates, bad weather, make friends with an orangutan, and somehow survive a volcanic eruption. The movie has some really cool big old bugs too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This lovely little cache of riches is dedicated to Lani, one of Mysterious Island's biggest fans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for camouflaged snapware containing the &quot;treasure.&quot; </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We'd like to start filling in our calendar, but after working 8 to 13 hours a day, we don't have the time to travel far - but we hope you do. You're looking for a camouflaged 5-gallon bucket. This is a BREEDER CACHE. Some stealth is required, but the cache is located in the quieter end of the parking lot. Once you're in the area, park your car in front of GZ. That'll decrease the possibility of muggle interference and give you time to slowly browse through the cache's contents. If you're not interested in placing caches, we've separated the micros from the swag. The swag is loose in the bucket while the micros are in the clear bag. Having our caches spread far and wide would be a treat. The micros contain logs and the larger ones contain logs, pens, and a bit of swag as well. It would be great if you'd shoot us a message through Geocaching.com with the GC code, so we can watchlist the cache and go after it ourselves one day. If you have containers that are gathering dust on the workbench, feel free to drop them off so that someone else can plant them and then surprise you one day. This will also help to insure that the bucket contains a variety of container types, not just what I tend to make or buy. If you choose to drop one off, leave a detailed description, so the planting cacher can send you the GC Code. Please write what type of micro you grab in your log. This lets me know when and if I need to restock. The cache location is only a couple miles from home, so it'll be easy to keep tabs on the inventory for restocking purposes. We'd like to recognize Reece's Pieces for PPFTF (pre-placement first to find), as she found the cache in the back seat of our truck and was awarded a tub-toy geocache! Congratulations to RdDrgn22, Baby Girl Sherry and GeoHamJoe on their RAPID FTF! One of our little cache containers has been discovered in northern Florida by a local cacher.</groundspeak:long_description>

The only reason this one was published much later than the others is because the Krum part of KrumBen was not happy about the rattlesnake's previous greeting. Although I really shouldn't complain as he was much more interested in sleeping in the sun than striking anyone.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The George E. LeStrange Preserve is located at the end of Ralls Rd., off of Selvitz Rd, in Fort Pierce. There is a 1 mile loop trail around a catch &amp; release pond. Boats with electric motors are allowed. The trail is hard packed &amp; suitable for bikes; it is elevated, so it should remain dry. The preserve is open only during daylight hours. Not only will you see tortoises, you'll see their burrows at many cache locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rattlesnakes and Gopher Tortoises are roommates, so please don't disturb their habitat.  Remember, the Gopher Tortoise is an endangered species.  Unfortunately, people seeking out and destroying rattlesnake nests, also destroy the tortoise burrow.  Just remember, the rattlesnake is shy and does NOT want to bite you.  It relies on vibrations so that it can leave before you get there.  Walking sticks are yours AND the rattlesnake's best friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I heard, but did not see peacocks. There's also a clear indication that the preserve is home to wild boar as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've just replaced the cache container as it was no longer where it was supposed to be and critters chewed it up but good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I neglected to double check my coords when there - I don't recall the exact placement as this is an adopted cache.  I've made the hint very explicit so you can easily find the cache.  Please let me know if the cache is more than 6 feet from it's posted coords.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look at the base of the larger pine closest to the clearing.  It's not near the flaky tree.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

There is a 1 mile loop trail around a catch &amp; release pond. Boats with electric motors are allowed. The trail is hard packed &amp; suitable for bikes; it is elevated, so it should remain dry. The preserve is open only during daylight hours. Not only will you see tortoises, you'll see their burrows at many cache locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rattlesnakes and Gopher Tortoises are roommates, so please don't disturb their habitat.  Remember, the Gopher Tortoise is an endangered species.  Unfortunately, people seeking out and destroying rattlesnake nests, also destroy the tortoise burrow.  Just remember, the rattlesnake is shy and does NOT want to bite you.  It relies on vibrations so that it can leave before you get there.  Walking sticks are yours AND the rattlesnake's best friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I heard, but did not see peacocks. There's also a clear indication that the preserve is home to wild boar as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've replaced the cache container with a newer one.

This series is intended to challenge you in unique and interesting ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find this prey, you will need to use all of your geo-senses. The posted coordinates will take you to a location where the final coordinates may be revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This prey is extremely cunning and can recognize neophyte cachers before they are even out of their vehicles. Approach with caution!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final cache is located in an area prone to alligators, snakes, fire ants, attack birds and other hazards so please do not attempt alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF gets a fifty dollar bill located in the bag with the log book and accolades in this description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone who finds this cache (without a hint) will be rewarded with the rank of Gamma Hirogen which is the lowest rank in the Hirogen hierarchy. Beta Hirogen is the next rank and is achieved only by the most tenacious hunters. The highest rank attainable is that of Alpha Hirogen. Put simply, the Alpha Hirogen has outstanding hunting skills and is the best of the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To attain the two highest ranks, you must have found the preceding cache for the lower rank without a hint. No skipping ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special prize will be awarded to the first team to attain Alpha Hirogen status. Log entries will determine the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;********** SPACE COAST GAMMA HIROGENS **********&lt;br/&gt;Sam-Wise *** FTF *** &lt;br/&gt;efrodo *** FTF *** &lt;br/&gt;Chief Talking Bull *** Honorary FTF *** &lt;br/&gt;Dale n Barb &lt;br/&gt;seastar255 &lt;br/&gt;Tony's Girl &lt;br/&gt;Keri&amp;Scott &lt;br/&gt;I_Get_Sidetracked &lt;br/&gt;TAPnDi &lt;br/&gt;TheClarksInFL &lt;br/&gt;TheSonFromFL &lt;br/&gt;explorer290 &lt;br/&gt;Trail Gators &lt;br/&gt;TeamShortStuff &lt;br/&gt;TheDeadlySins &lt;br/&gt;Grasshoppers&amp;Ant &lt;br/&gt;Plunder Cats &lt;br/&gt;PalmettoPirates &lt;br/&gt;Wildmark Lion &lt;br/&gt;********* ********* ********* ********* *********</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What an awesome cache! 
'The wildlife alone made this one of my favorites!! We had a relatively close encounter with a Bald Eagle, a Great Blue Heron that allowed us to pass within 10 feet of him, and several small birds that were moving too fast for me to identify them. 

I can't wait to see if Tryllast can turn some of his incorrect bizarre theories into caches!!

Great execution on this cache, thank you!
The cache container, as other have said, does not latch closed however, all the contents appeared to be safe and sound.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My friend Bjorn is a brilliant chef from Stockholm. We correspond on a regular basis, and I‚Äôve been telling him about Geocaching. Recently, Bjorn surprised me by telling me he hid a cache on his last trip to the United States. Bjorn‚Äôs not much of a computer person, so he mailed me a letter explaining where the cache was hidden. Since Bjorn doesn‚Äôt even know how to spell GPS, I had to find it the hard way. Once I found it, I nabbed the coordinates so everybody could join in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Bjorn did go to the trouble of hiding this cache, I‚Äôve added a rather unique requirement for logging a find; Obviously, you need to sign the logbook. You also must post your log in Bjorn‚Äôs native language, so that he can read them. No English allowed! LOL! Here‚Äôs a copy of the letter Bjorn sent, which should explain the difficulty I had in locating the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[URL=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jbc/home/chef.html]Translate your logs at this website[/URL]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[b][i]‚ÄúHellu Meester Reeffff.

But we proceeded into th jungle surrounding what was left of the barbed wire fence and were met with no results to the cache. We assume the cache has been lost to nature or removed from the area. A decent adventure, but sad to leave with no find.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Good evening fellow cachers, and welcome to the Seminole Ranch Conservation Area.&lt;br/&gt;Break out your flashlights &amp; skeeter repelant. This is gonna be a lotta fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was speaking with Jo Anna Babar of the St. John's River Water Management District about hiding another night cache, and I was bemoaning the scarcity of locations that are swampy, critter infested, and accessible after sunset. She suggested this area, formerly home to Fergie Le Frog's &quot;Reflection Cache&quot; (GCGXYG), and after some initial scouting, I gotta say, &quot;Thanx Jo Anna&quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park at the posted coordinates, which is on Hatbill Rd, off of State Rd 46, a little over 4 miles West of I-95. Proceed on foot roughly 0.43 miles west along the main grade, then slightly north, to N28* 37.205 W080* 58.366, where you'll find three reflectors in a triangle shape, stapled to a tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From here, shine your light around till you locate a small reflective marker stapled to another tree. Proceed to this marker, then look for the next marker. Sounds easy, right? Heh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jo Anna asked that I stick to existing game trails when the foiliage got too thick, to reduce our impact on the property, which is why your trail meanders all over the place. At some point near the end of the reflector trail, you'll find a tree with a 3 pointed reflective star. Affixed to this tree is a soda bottle preform with the final coordinates inside. From here, continue to follow markers, which will lead you out of the woods. Whwn you find three reflectors pointed down, continue that direction for about 50' and you'll be out of the woods. Watch your step coming out of the woods, as there are ankle breaking holes and dilapidated barbed wire waiting to ruin your day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with my other night cache, the marker rules are very simple; If the arrow is pointing up, go straight. If it points right or left, go that direction. If it points slightly right or left, turn slightly in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I strongly recommend you do not attempt this cache alone. These woods are somewhat perilous during broad daylight, as they are replete with venomous snakes, wild hogs, nasty spiders, and other critters that go &quot;bump&quot; in the night. The perils are significantly increased once the sun sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To survive your quest, I suggest you wear rugged boots, long pants and a long sleeve shirt. Bring bug spray, lots of water, at least two flashlights, a spare GPSr, a cell phone, extra batteries and a stout walking stick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I spoke with a Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife officer regarding this cache, and he requested that folks attempting it leave a cache page printout, or something denoting the fact that they are geocaching, on their dashboards. He advised that, when they find vehicles in the parking lot at night, they assume the owners are poaching, and hoof into the woods in search of them. By placing a cache page printout on your dash, they'll know why you're out there. Please leave your firearms at home, since possession of a gun is an arrestable offense in these woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encrypted hint is actually the coordinates for the tree with the soda bottle preform attached to it. In the event that Mother Nature wipes out a section of reflectors, you'll be able to decrypt the hint and finish the hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize is a silver 1968 Juego De La XIX Olimpiada Mexico 25 Pesos coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FIT5DP - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STT5DP - Start&lt;br/&gt;N 28¬∞ 37.152 W 080¬∞ 57.946&lt;br/&gt;The tree with three reflectors is the start of your quest&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We again joined forces with The Kelt and Navigatrix to seize another night cache.  The night started with a nice relaxing drive, even though we were stuck behind a slow bunch of cars, to the parking area at GZ.  Once we parked, we quickly hopped out of the car and felt the crisp cold air, so we added another layer of clothing, suited up, and headed out to the hog trap.  Along the way we saw something we have not seen in awhile, a crystal-clear view of the stars.  We soon arrived at the hog trap and started our frolic (or swagger) through the dark and cold woods.  Unlike Mr. Riffster‚Äôs other night cache, we did not encounter much wildlife, except for the unlimited amount of spiders and the &quot;smells like something is dead.&quot; Shortly after we passed the &quot;smells like something is dead,&quot; we came across a small patch of land that recharged or sense of smell with wild mint and irises. Later on our trek, we heard what sounded like people using semiautomatic handguns from airboats for unsavory reasons, but as we stomped through the woods, we were relieved that the shots seem to be getting further and further away.  Once we arrived at the Klingon looking reflectors, The Kelt quickly found the micro and we loaded up the coords in our Garmins.  Then a literal hop, skip, and a jump away to avoid barbed wire and holes in the ground we made it back to the main trail.  We scampered to the final GZ, and again The Kelt made the find.  We left a rubber ducky and after much negotiating, we took wiggle headed pen.  On the trip back, The Kelt made contact with Geolytical (it was great meeting you) and we all met for a pint at an Irish Pub and traded geo-war stories.  Thanks Trev and Miriam for another fun night of caching!  Mr. Riffster, thanks for another wonderful cache experience! </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A kwick glance at the cache page might lead you to suspect that the Riffster Clan was suddenly in the business of spiritual conversion. Au Contraire Mon Frair! You see, in this case, the statement was issued as an expletive, and should not be considered an agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;expliquez, s'il vous pla√Æt?&lt;/i&gt; Of Course! Telling embarrassing tales about myself is one of my favorite past times!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I found myself in Cocoa the other day, with Mark &amp; Peggy of The JailBirds, eating dinner at a restaurant that serves Americanized Spanish food such as burritos and enchiladas. While the food is pretty good, what sets this place apart is their sauce bar, where they have multiple dispensers, brimming with potential pain. This place labels its sauces with cartoon faces, with a smiley [:)] for &quot;Mild&quot; and a death mask [xx(] for &quot;You Gotta Be Kidding Me!&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I learned a while back that I wasn't man enough for the really hot stuff, so I thought I would try one degree milder, which was marked with a frowny face [:(]. I saturated my burrito with the stuff, and commenced wolfing it down, admiring right away the forehead sweats and scalp tingle that comes with a really good hot sauce. Apparently, this particular sauce has a delay built into it, because as I took my last bite, it hit me all at once, smacking me right between the eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Holy Mother Of God!&quot;&lt;/b&gt; I exclaimed at the top of my lungs, as I dove for my beverage and several handfuls of chips. Once again, I've proven to the entire free world, that I'm dumber than a bag of hammers. Perhaps I should invest in an mp3 player that loops words to the effect of, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Hey Riffster, if a place that specializes in hot sauce tells you a sauce is hot, maybe you should freekin' listen to them!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Just sayin'... Apparently, my agony was amusing, as Mark &amp; Peggy began utilizing the aforementioned expletive catch phrase to define any situation that seriously kicks your butt.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The next day, we met up with Vince, of The Flatouts, and splashed our kayaks at N 28* 39.957 / W 080* 54.686, for an exploratory paddle upstream, just to see where it went. The area to the north of the launch site is one of Florida's largest natural watersheds, comprising over 5,000 acres, all of which is channeled down 6 Mile Creek during times of rain. Central Florida had been inundated with gobs of rain recently, turning 6 Mile Creek into a swift moving river. As we worked our way upstream, the river banks grew closer together, forcing the steady flow of water through an ever narrowing channel, requiring greater and greater efforts to continue upstream. We made it through the torrent, into the primary wetland, and it was like someone turned off a fire hydrant. The gush turned to a sedate trickle, and we breathed a collective, though premature, sigh of relief, thinking the worst was behind us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because of the high water, the plain was mostly flooded, with clumps of grass poking through the water's surface. We hoped to find the main channel, so we could continue upstream, however, I fell victim to illusion. Scanning the plain, we found water flowing in from several directions, and after a few false starts, I finally detected what appeared to be the strongest current, which, I assumed must be the channel. In just a few strokes, we found ourselves hopelessly mired in submerged obstructions, requiring Herculean efforts just to move a few feet. After what felt like several miles, (but was, in reality, only a few hundred feet), Mark expressed best, what we were all thinking:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Holy Mother Of God!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hid an ammo can to mark this auspicious occasion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As an indication of how much effort was expended in creating this hide, it took us 3 hours to get from the launch site to ground zero, but less than half an hour to get back. I don't know if it will be easier, or harder, as the water level drops.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This area is closed to the general public during hunting season, which takes up about 3 weeks each year, over various dates. You can find the hunting dates here:

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baseball Fan Park and grab!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;This cache is located at the Charlie C. Brooks Community Park.
A great place to take in a ball game or just walk your dog. Please
use extreme stealth as this is a VERY active area even when there
isn't a game.Please replace exactly as found, straight is
important.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

This song was written in 1908 by a man named Jack Norworth. One day
when he was riding a New York City subway train, he spotted a sign
that said &quot;Ballgame Today at the Polo Grounds.&quot; Some
baseball-related lyrics popped into his head, that were later set
to some music by Albert Von Tilzer, to become the well known
baseball song, &quot;Take Me Out To The Ballgame.&quot; Despite the fact that
neither Norworth or Tilzer had ever been to a baseball game at the
time the song was written, it is one of the most widely sung songs
in America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(1927 version)
&lt;p&gt;Nelly Kelly loved baseball games, Knew the players, knew all
their names, You could see her there ev'ry day, Shout &quot;Hurray&quot; when
they'd play. Her boy friend by the name of Joe Said, &quot;To Coney
Isle, dear, let's go,&quot; Then Nelly started to fret and pout, And to
him I heard her shout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Take me out to the ball game, Take me out with the crowd. Buy
me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, I don't care if I never get back,
Let me root, root, root for the home team, If they don't win it's a
shame. For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, At the old
ball game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelly Kelly was sure some fan, She would root just like any man,
Told the umpire he was wrong, All along, good and strong. When the
score was just two to two, Nelly Kelly knew what to do, Just to
cheer up the boys she knew, She made the game sing this song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Take me out to the ball game, Take me out with the crowd. Buy
me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, I don't care if I never get back,
Let me root, root, root for the home team, If they don't win it's a
shame. For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, At the old
ball game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to JDSquared on the First To
Find!&lt;/strong&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hooray, the new Soccer Complex if finally completed on Wilmington
Island! (I'm a football fan myself, but I like flying my
helicopters at this field) The project turned out very nice, and
I'm sure everyone will enjoy the new complex. We decided it would
be nice to have another cache close to home. We hope you enjoy
finding this cache, as always we have tried to make it interesting
with a unique container. There are a few things in the cache
including a picture of George Washington in the log book for the
FTF prize.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember, if you don't sign the log, you didn't find
it...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pine Solve&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This park and grab may require some stealth depending on the time of day. The cache is on public land. When we looked on Google maps for this location we didn't see the road obstacle which prevents us from taking you to a very scenic site we wanted to use, but it is a fun and challenging cache because of the container and placement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be sure to replace as found. Be careful with this fragile container. Please bring TWEEZERS and your own pen as this is a small micro.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do Not Uninstall this Cache ;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give this one a try but be prepaired, if your timing is wrong you could end up with wet feet. Unless there has been very heavy rain or High Spring Tide, you should be fine. You can spot all kinds of interesting critters on this hunt and see some very interesting birds including an active Osprey nest, crabs, snakes and maybe even a wild bore ;)&lt;br /&gt;
Please take the time to replace exactly as found so the next person can get the same enjoyment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come take in the view of the marsh, the Bull River off in the
distance and the line of cars heading to and from Tybee Island, you
may even spot a large container ship heading to port or back out to
sea. You can park before the bridge. There are lots of Fiddler
Crabs running around under the bridge that the kids will get a kick
out of depending on the tide. As always, the container is a little
different...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We figured it was time to get a little more tricky with our hides.
Your going to have to work for this one a little. We suggest you
park close to our other cache (GC22525) and walk down the paved
trail to the dirt trail. If you park close to the cache, you have
some mud to cross unless it has been dry for a long time. This is a
great area to walk the dog and have fun with the kids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be careful with this container and its hiding spot and
please replace as you found it so the next person can have the same
challenge as you did. Please bring your own pen as this is a micro
log holder in an unusual container.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Bridge Over The Quagmire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taking you to a nice trail with a surprise at the cache
location that you will hopefully enjoy as much as we did when we
first found it.  Its an easy to find cache made for
everyone, especially for kids to enjoy finding and looking through
without having to work to hard. The container has some nice swag
that we hope the finders will like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, please replace exactly as found so the next person
has the same fun. This is a high muggle area and muggles can sneak
up on you very quickly, so keep a L@@Kout.&lt;/p&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE on the First To
Find!&lt;/strong&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This should be an easy find, but it's well hidden. You can park at
N 32 01.975 W080 59.567, the sign at the head of the trail is a bit
unusual but harmless unless you plan on using a dirt bike ;) Or you
can park at GC22525 and walk the trail and grab several other
caches along the trail. This box contains a Letterbox stamp, please
do not trade the stamp, it must remain. This is a great area to
hike, bike or just stroll on miles of paved or leaf covered dirt
trails, bring the kids and the dog, they will enjoy the woods and
the fresh air plus the area is loaded with geocaches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some History on this Area&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Indigo ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äôs Dye‚Äù, In the early days this
area was used as a plantation area for indigo. Indigo was used for
making dyes. Consumers' demand for exotic fashion fueled the
expansion of indigo cultivation, but at a substantial human price.
Slaves cultivated indigo, processed into dye, and then dyed fabrics
an amazing shade of blue. With the end of the British bounty to
North American indigo growers and Britain's switch to Indian
indigo, indigo prices collapsed. Additional competition was posed
by high-quality French and Guatemalan indigo, which could be
harvested up to five times a year (in contrast to a maximum of
three harvests in North America.) Natural obstacles arose, as well.
Efforts by Mississippi planters to expand the indigo frontier
(1790-1794) were thwarted by grasshoppers. The indigo fields of
northeastern Florida and coastal Georgia were repeatedly decimated
by hurricanes in the early 1800s. With the invention of the cotton
gin, which enabled planters to make greater profits in cotton,
indigo fields were replaced with cotton. Other planters turned to
corn, which was much easier to cultivate. By 1800, commercial
indigo production in the southern United States had virtually
vanished.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come party with us as Pink Floyd plays at our deal. We like to get away from the city crowds, tap a keg under the stars and this spot does it. You know those teachers will drive you to the edge with their dark sarcasm and thought control... Everyone knows we don't need no education...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, if you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace EXACTLY as found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to YOUR NAME COULD BE HERE on the First To
Find!&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a short walk on the Tybee Railroad bed, do not pass go, do
not collect 200 dollars, but please do collect the Train Station
Cache. Set a spell on the coolest bench along the old Railroad bed
and wait for the ghost train to arrive, while your waiting, enjoy
the view and if the tide is high, the water will be close under
foot. We hope you can continue on to collect the other four in the
series!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some History...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last run on the Central of Georgia's Tybee District occurred
on July 31, 1933, when engine 329 pulled eight coaches of a Central
of Georgia Railway Clerk's Organization picnic special to Tybee and
back.The rails were removed beginning in September, 1933.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Information....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you walk, jog, or bicycle on this 6.5-mile trail,
you‚Äôre traversing the roadbed of a railroad that took
passengers from eastern Savannah to Tybee Island for nearly 50
years starting in the late 1800s. Chatham County maintains the
palm-lined, limestone trail on McQueen‚Äôs Island and created
it beginning in 1991 as part of the Rails Into Trails program, an
effort to transform abandoned railroad rights-of-way into
recreational areas. A trip along the entire length of the trail
takes you past 18 fitness stations, past 30 wooden picnic tables,
and across 10 wooden footbridges. Besides what it offers in the way
of exercise, the trail presents visitors with vistas of marshland
and the south channel of the Savannah River, opportunities for
fishing and crabbing, and glimpses of wildlife indigenous to the
marsh. Keep your eyes peeled for creatures such as the Eastern box
turtle, the diamondback terrapin, the American alligator, the
redtailed hawk, the brown pelican, and the great blue heron, and
don‚Äôt be surprised if you walk up on a rattlesnake or two. We
haven‚Äôt seen any on our trips there, but we understand they
enjoy sunning themselves on the trail. The railroad was built over
17.7 miles of salt marsh, rivers, and tidal creeks by a group of
investors led by Savannahian D. G. Purse, who in 1885 owned a good
portion of Tybee Island and was trying to find a way to transport
people there that was faster than the two-hour ride by steamboat.
His solution was to build a railroad, and the idea was considered a
harebrained scheme by local folks; they were convinced it was an
engineering feat that couldn‚Äôt be accomplished. But Purse
persisted, and his Savannah and Tybee Railway began making
regularly scheduled runs in July 1887. A few years later, the line
became part of the Central of Georgia Railway system and was
operated from then on as the Savannah and Atlantic Railroad. The
last passenger excursion was in July 1933; by then, the advent of
the automobile and the construction of a road to Tybee (now US 80)
had made the railway obsolete. But in its heyday, the little
railroad carried thousands of Savannahians and out-of-towners to
Tybee for days of sunning and swimming at the beach and nights of
dancing at the Tybrisa Pavilion. The entrance to the trail places
you at its midpoint and is on US 80 just east of the Bull River
Bridge. The highway is well traveled, and there is not much space
at the trail entrance, so be careful when you pull off the road to
park. The trail is off-limits after darkness falls. Plans are to
extend the trail all the way to Tybee Island itself, but
that‚Äôs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to Rydawg14 on the
First To Find!&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a longer walk on the Tybee Railroad bed, do not pass go, do
not collect 200 dollars, but please do collect the Train Station 3
Cache. Enjoy the walk to this cache, don't forget to collect the
other four in the series. You can bring a picnic lunch and use one
of the many picnic tables along the way while you're waiting for
the ghost train to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some History...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last run on the Central of Georgia's Tybee District occurred
on July 31, 1933, when engine 329 pulled eight coaches of a Central
of Georgia Railway Clerk's Organization picnic special to Tybee and
back.The rails were removed beginning in September, 1933.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;More Information....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you walk, jog, or bicycle on this 6.5-mile trail,
you‚Äôre traversing the roadbed of a railroad that took
passengers from eastern Savannah to Tybee Island for nearly 50
years starting in the late 1800s. Chatham County maintains the
palm-lined, limestone trail on McQueen‚Äôs Island and created
it beginning in 1991 as part of the Rails Into Trails program, an
effort to transform abandoned railroad rights-of-way into
recreational areas. A trip along the entire length of the trail
takes you past 18 fitness stations, past 30 wooden picnic tables,
and across 10 wooden footbridges. Besides what it offers in the way
of exercise, the trail presents visitors with vistas of marshland
and the south channel of the Savannah River, opportunities for
fishing and crabbing, and glimpses of wildlife indigenous to the
marsh. Keep your eyes peeled for creatures such as the Eastern box
turtle, the diamondback terrapin, the American alligator, the
redtailed hawk, the brown pelican, and the great blue heron, and
don‚Äôt be surprised if you walk up on a rattlesnake or two. We
haven‚Äôt seen any on our trips there, but we understand they
enjoy sunning themselves on the trail. The railroad was built over
17.7 miles of salt marsh, rivers, and tidal creeks by a group of
investors led by Savannahian D. G. Purse, who in 1885 owned a good
portion of Tybee Island and was trying to find a way to transport
people there that was faster than the two-hour ride by steamboat.
His solution was to build a railroad, and the idea was considered a
harebrained scheme by local folks; they were convinced it was an
engineering feat that couldn‚Äôt be accomplished. But Purse
persisted, and his Savannah and Tybee Railway began making
regularly scheduled runs in July 1887. A few years later, the line
became part of the Central of Georgia Railway system and was
operated from then on as the Savannah and Atlantic Railroad. The
last passenger excursion was in July 1933; by then, the advent of
the automobile and the construction of a road to Tybee (now US 80)
had made the railway obsolete. But in its heyday, the little
railroad carried thousands of Savannahians and out-of-towners to
Tybee for days of sunning and swimming at the beach and nights of
dancing at the Tybrisa Pavilion. The entrance to the trail places
you at its midpoint and is on US 80 just east of the Bull River
Bridge. The highway is well traveled, and there is not much space
at the trail entrance, so be careful when you pull off the road to
park. The trail is off-limits after darkness falls. Plans are to
extend the trail all the way to Tybee Island itself, but
that‚Äôs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

The parking fees are $4 Adults 16+, $2.50 Senior 65+, $1.50 Youth 6 to 15 years and under 6 free. The park hours are Standard Time: 6:00 AM‚Äî6:00 PM and Daylight Savings Time: 6:00 AM‚Äî9:00PM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunting Island is a barrier island and serve a specific purpose in protecting the coast as well as providing a habitat and ecosystem in the tidal marshes for many animals and plants. The dunes on the sea side of the island also serve specific purposes. The dunes develop when winds blow in from the beach. The sand then accumulates around something that slows the wind, such as plants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, a mound develops which slows the wind which helps create a larger mound. Sand continues to be added to the front (windward side) and removed from the back (leeward side). Plants growing in the dunes help stabilize the loss of sand. Dunes can develop in parallel rows perpendicular to the wind. Dunes farther from the beach are older and have a larger amount of vegetation growing on them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logging requirement: You must answer the code phrase correctly using the following answers to these questions (i.e. answer 1 space answer 2):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Does the beach and dunes here on Hunting Island experience more or less erosion than other SC barrier islands? (Answer can be found on a sign nearby.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. What specific reptile depend on these dunes for survival? (Answer can be found on a sign nearby.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Please do not post the answers to these questions in your log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;A11YDGK - Answers&lt;br/&gt;N 32¬∞ 22.523 W 080¬∞ 26.208&lt;br/&gt;Sign containing answers&lt;br/&gt;PK1YDGK - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 32¬∞ 22.483 W 080¬∞ 26.280&lt;br/&gt;Parking area      </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Our First Cache! I read about Geocaching in the Scouting magazine
and introduced it to my Son currently a Webelos Scout and his
sister who loves the outdoors and now we cannot get enough. So we
are planting our first cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a Scouting friendly cache so please place appropriate
items for Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts in the cache. Scouting, as
known to millions of youth and adults, was brought to the United
States in 1910 by William D. Boyce after chance encounter with an
Unknown Boy Scout in England. Sense that time Scouting has evolved
over the past 100 years through the efforts of men and women
dedicated to bettering youth. These pioneers of the program
conceived outdoor activities that developed skills in young boys
and gave them a sense of enjoyment, fellowship, and a code of
conduct for everyday living. My family strongly supports the Boy
Scout Movement and we think that Geocaching provides a great
opportunity to connect the high tech with the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current mission statement of the BSA is &quot;to prepare young
people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by
instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the Luden Dr. or Ashley Dr. parking areas on the sawmill
branch trail. The walk is the same form either location.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some good places to eat in this shopping center, as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is practically overflowing with treasures. Best place for parking is at the dead end on Palomino Dr.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a short hike. The land is very level and a pleasant walk. You will come to a gate at first. You will have to cross over it. This land belongs to my church. I have already gotten permission from Pastor Keith for people to go on the property. The only thing is PRACTICE CACHE IN TRASH OUT policy of geocaching. If you take a picture of yourself picking up a piece of trash (honor system that it was originally there), at the one year anniversary I will draw a name from the participants and that person will win a geocoin.</groundspeak:long_description>

A fellow and his dog were in the area so I made a few calls while I waited him out.  Searched a bit for clues but found none. Checked the hint and continued the search. Looked in the proper direction from every angle and height I could think of but came up with nothing but a replacement container for one of my own caches.

Guess I could just walk the fence line(s) until I found it but whats the fun in that?</groundspeak:text>

Found while in the Charlotte area. Enjoyed the walk out and back.lest sm carbiner (9 cents @ Walgreens) and a small Sharpie.

Thanks and Happy Trails! 

(Logged as found on OC.US.  Late realized it was also listed as an OX cache.)</groundspeak:text>

We have noticed a general lack of caches in our area and have decided to remedy this. The CTM series is going to be traditional, multi, and puzzle caches that will range in difficulty from stupid easy to majorly hard. We will give you information or clues about the movie -- stuff that we know and find rather interesting. We expect this series to be never ending, as our current movie collection has 472 titles at the time of publishing. Have fun fellow cachers and may the PAF be with you.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This film, which takes place in the Alaskan Wilderness, inspired a highly successful TV reality show of the same name in Brazil, where participants were selected from normal people, including executives, graduates and clerks, left in a wild and deserted area of Brazilian landscape and had to survive using techniques similar to the ones mentioned by one of the main characters.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the first cache in the new Crouching Tigers Movie (CTM)
series. We have noticed a general lack of caches in our area and
have decided to remedy this. The CTM series is going to be puzzle
caches that will range in difficulty from stupid easy to majorly
hard. We will give you clues to the movie in the cache description
and then give you possible answers and coordinates. We expect this
series to be never ending, as our current movie collection has 467
titles. Have fun fellow cachers and may the PAF be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case you haven't picked up on it yet, this movie may
have something to do with baseball. The name of this cache is a
adaptation of a popular (although mis-quoted) line from the movie.
The movie debuted in the late 80s and quickly gathered a following.
Critics were not as enamored, as the movie was eventually named one
of the &quot;20 Most Overrated Movies of All Time&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now given you all the clues you should need to figure
out which movie this cache is based on. Below are 4 options, one of
them being the correct movie. The coordinates next to the correct
movie is the actual location of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo'd lock-n-lock. Be confident in your
answer and patient with your GPS. (Tree cover tends to make it
bounce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is for the second movie of a very popular trilogy. We
recommend finding these caches in order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah But You Have Heard of Me&quot; contains the North coordinates for
&quot;How's Mum&quot;, and this cache contains the West coordinates for
&quot;How's Mum&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second movie in a blockbuster trilogy. It earned
$135,634,554 opening weekend breaking the record previously set by
Spiderman 2. Release prints of this movie were delivered to
theaters with the fake title &quot;Rummy 2&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The central figure in this movie is William Wilberforce
(1759-1833). He is a zealous believer in God, human rights activist
and British member of Parliament, who battled through
discouragement and illness for two decades to end the slave trade
in England. In a time of personal crisis, Wilberforce is inspired
and encouraged in his long fight to abolish slavery by the former
slave ship master, John Newton, who wrote a beloved hymn following
his conversion to Christianity. William helped found the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, his home was like an
animal sanctuary. In the movie he had cats, dogs, goats, horses,
lizards, porcupines, monkeys, and a VERY large rabbit.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This movie has a star studded cast including one of our favorite
actors in a role that he will never leave behind. The movie was
released in July of 2003 and by December 2003 it had grossed almost
$306 million. Robert De Niro was originally approached to play of
one of the title roles, but declined because he felt that the movie
would not do well. He later went on the play a similar character in
another movie that ironically did not have nearly as much
acclaim.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

No problem!&lt;br/&gt;Was going to call this &quot;lake view&quot; but after caching today changed my mind.  Hard cache, easy cache, after finding one I seem to always ask &quot;WHY OH WHY&quot; (YOY) do I make it so hard on myself.  If it is up, I spend all my time looking down.  If it is in the front, will start in the back.  If hanging in a tree, will start in the bush.  YOY will I bushwhack when there is a trail?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully you will be asking YOY after finding this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your looking for the allusive Silver Bison Tube.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend of the Fairy Stone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Many hundreds of years
before Chief Powhatan's reign, fairies were dancing around a spring
of water, playing with naiads and wood nymphs, when an elfin
messenger arrived from a city far away. He brought news of the
death of Christ. When these creatures of the forest heard the story
of the crucifixion, they wept. As their tears fell upon the earth,
they crystallized to form beautiful crosses. When the fairies
disappeared from the enchanted place, ground about the spring and
the adjacent valley was strewn with these mementos of the
event.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For many years people held
these little crosses in superstitious awe, firm in the belief that
they protected the wearer against witchcraft, sickness, accidents
and disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairy stones are
brown staurolite, a combination of SILICA, IRON and ALUMINUM (and
dots of real garnet). Together, these minerals crystallize in twin
form, accounting for the cross-like structure. Staurolite is only
found in rocks that have been subjected to intense
heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This earthcache is located in Fairy Stone
State park in Stuart, Virginia. Fairy Stone State Park is the
largest of Virginia's six original state parks and is home to its
namesake &quot;fairy stones.&quot; For more
information on the park, click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state_parks/documents/fairst.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The Earthcache is located in the &quot;stone hunting area&quot; of the park.
The parking area is on private property, but the land owners permit
parking for this purpose. The hunting area can include hills that
are quite steep. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIGGING IS STRICTLY
PROHIBITED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


To claim this cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the name of the business where you parked as the code phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Micro is placed at a
monument that honors my family heritage. It is placed in honor of
my Great Grandfather, Berman C. Snidow, and my Grandmother, Kay
Snidow Sowers. Both of them had a
profound effect on my life. My Great Grandfather lived to be 106,
and he
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sowersnet.com/genealogy/BC_Snidow.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;told a much
     &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sowersnet.com/genealogy/kss.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; embellished version
     of the facts on the monument. Whenever any family member came
     to visit, he ALWAYS looked at them and said &quot;Where'd you come
     from?&quot; My Grandmother instilled in me the importance of
     knowing my lineage and keeping this information for
     future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is limited parking at
the site, but parking is plentiful at the surrounding businesses.
The monument can be seen from US Rt. 460.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is being
maintained by my father, known to the geocaching community as
Ham_N_Aches.&lt;/p&gt;

It's in plain sight kind-of, with a really small climb to get to it. It's called The Lunch Spot because many people who work in the area park and eat their lunch here, because its under the only tree in the area that provides shade at lunch time.

Thanks to the neongeo app, we are now completely offline cachers using our cell phone. It's also hard to get out with our 6 month old. We know the color the log sheet was in - my dad's favorite color. GPS was about 20 ft. at GZ, however the hill seems to block a good signal in that area. Signed log sheet - TNLN. TFTC!

The scenery is great as you make your way to this cache just do not plan to do it fast. We think you will enjoy this hide, as much as we enjoyed making it, we hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are careful you may not get wet, but do not count on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache as found, this location looks as if it might have flooded in the past, and as stashed it should survive for many years to come, high water or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Since I worked through lunch, I decided to try to grab a least a couple of the caches before we left.  Man! This shopping area is HUGE.  There seem to be about 8 caches in here,  I only had about 10 minutes to get what I could.  Got this one, and one other.  I know you're supposed to trade bugs at a hotel, but I accidentally left mine on the desk at home since I had to start early today, and since it would take three to four hours to run home and get them... I elected to just swipe one!  TFTC!  

EDIT: Gee... if I had seen the strict injunction against just taking a bug on my GPS I probably wouldn't have... at least that bug isn't just going to the other side of town.  It's got at least 75 mile on it from being kidnapped.  Who knows... I may have to come back when someone balances the system... if so I'll make up for it.</groundspeak:text>

truly for the kids and anyone who is a kid at heart. This cache
will have an ever changing theme based on the holiday season. When
rehiding the cache, keep in mind that a little cover will go a long
way,and that too much makes the cache location quite obvious.

We headed out before early enough to reach the cache and return to the car before the rain started. It was a slippery, mudfest walking to and from the cache (everything was melting), but we did not care. Dad did the honors of retrieving the cache, and the girls dug thru the loot (I don't know how you manage to cram so much goodies into that box!). They made some festive trades before dad rehid it. This cache definately hit the spot today! THANKS!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Dreary day + dreary spirits = time to cache? Well it did for us. For the past several weeks, most of my days off have been rainy. Seems like the caching sprits have been trying to stop us from going out lately. It did not look like it was raining thru my windows today, so I loaded up Heather &amp; we headed out. I needed a pick-me-up, and this cache promised merriment! As soon as I pulled out of the garage, I realized that it was misting a bit. Oh well, maybe it would stop. Very nice park and walking trail. I made quick work out of the first stage, and down the trail we went. No trouble finding the final...Heather was absolutely THRILLED to pull out a Scooby Doo toy from the cache. We traded TBs and headed back to the car, just a little more damp than when we got there (the misting never stopped). No &quot;merry men&quot; (women or children) in the park today, but we left merrier. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So today is our geocaching 1 yr anniversary and mommy and the lil ruts weren't going to let the rain stop us from fiding a cache, so out we went.  Found the park rather easily and headed on out trek.  We found stage one, but mommy had to retrieve it because of the prickers gaurding it.  We quickly solved the puzzle and continued on the trail.  Of course we had to stop to play for a few on the really cool playground, but then we continued on to the cache.  Lil C was basically standing on the cache saying &quot;it has to be here somewhere&quot; as mommy touched something and uncovered it to laughter from the lil ruts.  We made our trades and continued to the car.  Thanks for the nice walk in such a great little park.  It is a lot bigger than i thought it was going to be and the walking trail was quite enjoyable.

Once Heather got off of the bus, we picked up my mom and headed into the insanity. We did a lot of shopping, stood in a lot of lines, Heather road some canival rides, and then we decided to head home. We were parked pretty close to the cache, so I decided to see if we could hit it before leaving. The crowds had thinned, so I snagged, signed, replaced quickly. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Since we never found the replacement box, we headed out today to snag this cache. It was kind of neat to see how much things have grown since March. Everything was brown, now everything is green...and the dead deer alongside the road has done some serious decomposing since March [xx(]. We found the cache with no trouble. The kids made some small trades before we hit the road. Saw a lot of fishermen on the way out. TFTC! </groundspeak:text>

He finished up that day with 3 caches searched for, 3 caches found...a great start!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Saturday, August 8, 2009, Red, along with 3 of his caching pals, set out on a quest for 1000...it was hot, it was dark, it was long...number 1000 eluded them, this time! But the experience was great!!! The memories will be cherished and the cache hunt will be remembered forever!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the defeat, another target had to be found...but see, up in Erie there is an annual event entitled the Thousandaires BBQ and what better way to celebrate a milestone then with a bunch of friends!! Red spent the weekend camping in Erie with a group of great caching pals from Butler and, on August 22, 2009, after he logged the BBQ, '1000 found' appeared next to his name!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now on to the cache- This cache is located on the Montour Trail and can be a short walk or can be a long one. There are many different parking areas, choose the one you want and head on out! You are looking for an ammo can stocked with goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations again Red and we hope everyone enjoys this small tribute to Red!!</groundspeak:long_description>

park in Upper St. Clair! This is a 29oz clear Lock 'n Lock
container that contains information for the puzzle cache 
OXRGCV ~ 'Owney'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are small trades in the cache and a log book that needs to
be signed to earn your smilie. Please be careful when retrieving
this cache. The terrain rating is for the last 50' and can be very
muddy. Of course, there might be an easier way to go, but we will
let you decide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hay's Park has 1 basketball court (no lights), 1 tennis court
(no lights) and Playground Equipment (in wood chips) that includes
1 swing set, red cement climber, 1 play structure with small slide
and tire swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park also has several other miscellaneous items such as an
asphalt walking trail, a spraypool, a small shelter, a water
fountain, a grass multi-purpose area, perimeter lighting and a
barbecue grill. There are a few parking spaces as well off the side
of Hays Road.&lt;/p&gt;

My Dragon and I took a detour from our usual flight path over the Montour Trail to look for this one, just so we could score our first OpenCache.

Nice park, too, but I don't get Muggle games. They were batting some yellow ball over a net, running to and fro while periodically uttering explicatives. I don't know . . .  What some people call fun!

The girls got to learn all about geocaching and wanted to place a permanent cache, so they decided that this would be a great spot for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed in South Park near the Girl Scout cabin. The road to the cabin is for authorized vehicles only, so, unless you are authorized, you will have to find another location to park. There are several options - some will have a shorter easier walk than others. Once you get to the cabin, the cache is only a few hundred feet further along the trail. The trail can be very muddy at times, but it is pretty level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may encounter several things along this trail! Horses, bikes and joggers pass by this spot frequently, so be sure to cover the cache up well and, if spotted, take the opportunity to explain geocaching to a muggle. The cache is hidden in a .30 cal ammo can about 15 feet off of the trail. There could be some thorns, so be careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it was hidden, it was full of all sorts of things. There were Girl Scout patches, Girl Scout Swaps, some other Girl Scout themed items along with the typical swag and several opencaching items. Please trade fairly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy finding it as much as we did this summer! Be careful and Cache on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the park closes at midnight!!  Permission for this cache has been granted by Allegheny County Parks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You are not allowed to park in this area unless you are using the cabin. The entrance is marked- please obey all park signs. There are plenty of places to park in the area - 2 suggested places would be near the Grant Pavilion or near the VIP area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a basic puzzle cache that everyone should be able to solve. First we would like to tell you the Brownie story and make sure you share it with your kids and grandkids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brownie Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cottage on the edge of the wood was in an awful mess. There were dishes to be washed, clothes to be ironed and toys scattered all over the floor. Tommy and Betty didn't care. They hated boring old housework. &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; their mother sighed. &quot;I can't keep the cottage tidy. If only we had a Brownie!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What's a Brownie?&quot; asked Tommy. &quot;A Brownie is a magical little creature, which slips into houses very early before anyone is awake. It tidies toys, irons clothes, washes dishes and does all sorts of helpful things in secret,&quot; replied his mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;That's great! How can we get one?&quot; wondered Betty. &quot;The Wise Owl in the woods would know I suppose,&quot; her mother said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Late that night, Tommy and Betty crept out of the cottage into the woods. It was cold and dark and full of shadows- or were they ghosts? &quot;We can't go back. We've got to find the Wise Owl,&quot; said Betty firmly. &quot;Twitt twoo. How do you do?&quot; a voice hooted at them from a nearby tree. &quot;The Wise Owl!&quot; Tommy hugged Betty in relief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And soon the children were seated on a branch snuggling close to the big bird's feathers. They explained they were looking for a Brownie. &quot;Do you know where we could find one?&quot; asked Betty. &quot;Indeed I do hooted the Owl, and, placing her beak close to Betty's ear, she explained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Tommy, imagine!&quot; exclaimed Betty. &quot;There's a Brownie in that pool over there. I've got to go to the pool over there. I've got to turn round three times and say:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Twist me and turn me and show me the elf, I looked in the water and there saw‚Ä¶&quot;.' &quot;Who? Who? Who?&quot; hooted the Owl. &quot;Look into the water and you'll find your Brownie looking back at you. Her name will finish the rhyme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The children raced over to the pool. Betty did exactly as the Owl had said: &quot;Twist me and turn me and show me the elf, I looked in the water and there saw‚Ä¶&quot; She looked into the pool. &quot;Well, can you see it? Can you see a Brownie?&quot; yelled Tommy, hopping from foot to foot in excitement. &quot;No,&quot; said Betty, All I can see is my own reflection.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tommy and Betty were so tired and disappointed that by the time they reached the tree again, they were in tears. &quot;Boo, hoo, hoo. What's the matter with you two?&quot; hooted the Owl, offering them a hanky. &quot;We didn't find a Brownie,&quot; sniffed Betty. &quot;I saw no one in the water but myself.&quot; &quot;Well, well&quot; said the Owl. &quot;Let's see if that fits the rhyme.&quot; &quot;Twist me and turn me and show me the elf, I looked in the water and there saw‚Ä¶&quot; &quot;Myself!&quot; finished Betty. &quot;But I'm not a Brownie!&quot; &quot;Too true, too true,&quot; hooted the Owl. &quot;But you could act like one for a change and so could Tommy. It would be fun.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tommy and Betty returned thoughtfully to the cottage. If you had passed that way very early the next morning, you would have seen a lamp burning in the kitchen window and two figures busily scurrying about inside. And when the children's mother came down for breakfast, she couldn't believe her eyes. There wasn't a toy in sight. Everything was clean and tidy. &quot;Why, a Brownie has been here. How wonderful!&quot; she gasped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From that day to this, the cottage has been a different place. And Tommy and Betty have been like different children. They never get bored now; they are too busy planning their secret good turns. Of course, their mother has discovered the truth. She thinks she is very lucky to have such helpful children. And Tommy and Betty have discovered how right the Wise Owl was: being human Brownies is FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There you have the story of the Brownie!! Now to find the cache...You are looking for a 2qt lock&amp;lock that had a bunch of neat things in it when it was was first hidden including some Girl Scout pins, patches and buttons.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the given key, decypher the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRNEPU SBE GUR PNPUR NG ABEGU SBEGL QRTERRF AVARGRRA CBVAG BAR AVAR AVAR JRFG RVTUGL QRTERRF MREB MREB CBVAG FVK BAR FVK &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decryption Key&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M&lt;br/&gt;-------------------------&lt;br/&gt;N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(letter above equals below, and vice versa)&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

After pulling in, running to grab (because it was so fridgid), running back to the car and pulling away, we realized we shouldn't have parked back in there.  Oops!  That was quite a little hike!

&lt;br /&gt;
South Park has a rich history.¬† This geocache is hidden in a long-forgotten portion of the park known as the Cascades.¬† A large parking lot is close by, across which sits historic Oliver Miller Homestead.¬†

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
South Park was designed by landscape architect Paul B. Riis in 1927.¬† Together, South and North Park hold designation as the first two parks in Allegheny County.¬†&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Riis aimed to design South Park in a prairie style by utilizing natural resources from the park itself.¬† This geocache is hidden in what was once known as the Cascades. It is a collection of strategically placed stratified rock which had been harvested from the park grounds. A small natural stream would fill the pools, cascading down multiple levels to the bottom pool.&lt;br /&gt;
Park officials decided to take South Park in a different direction to accommodate patrons of the Allegheny County Fair. They departed from Mr. Riis' vision and, sadly, have let the natural beauty fade into the background. You will see what is left as you search for the geocache.&lt;br /&gt;
Take a moment to look around and imagine the Cascades in its original grandeur. Despite the negligence, it is still a peaceful place. Perhaps one day it will be revisited and recreated for more people to enjoy.

&lt;br /&gt;
Please park on the street,but be sure not to block the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In order to find this cache you must first find the three traditional caches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OX25CG7
~ Ichi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OX3KG5H
~ Ni&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OXRGD0
~ San&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 3 caches will have the needed coordinates and a tool required to log this puzzle cache. Once you have the tool and needed information from those three, and have solved the following logic puzzle, you can then make your way toward the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The cache is located at : &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;N40 19.ABX W080 04.CYZ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the values of A,B,C,X,Y and Z in the three traditional caches. Having just the coordinates will not be sufficient enough to be able to sign the logbook. You must also solve the following logic puzzle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOGIC PUZZLE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With a field of five for the south hills marathon race,
there was little to no interest from the local gamblers. In order
to spark some interest in the event and earn some money, the local
bookie decided to open the books to multiple bets at high odds. In
order to place a multiple bet, you must bet on two propositions.
You will win only if both propositions turn out to be true.
Unfortunately, these 5 bets were not winning bets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    1) Frank Graham will not win the gold, nor
Billy Casker the silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    2) Edith Forge will win a medal, and Jack
Angel will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    3) Jack Angel and Darla Edwards will both win
medals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    4) Jack Angel will not win the silver, nor
Darla Edwards the bronze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    5) Frank Graham will win a medal, and Edith
Forge will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, who won each of the medals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Give your answers in initials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                Gold
 ___. ___.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                Silver
___. ___.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                Bronze
___. ___.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now that you have solved the logic problem and you have the coordinates, make your way to the cache site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The cache is placed on private property with permission, so please be respectful. Leave everything just as you found it. If you see the owner, feel free to say hello! Good luck and happy caching! Note: as always, the log book must be signed to earn that smilie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We also learned 2 things from this experience...be thorough and a chunk of ice is NOT a good snowball (sorry Dennie!). Learned some other stuff, too, but don't want to give anything away for the next folks. Took 2 TBs (Brenda has been wanting that bowling pin since the event), left 2 TBs &amp; duckie.

starting point for this night time cache. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be very hard to impossible to locate during daylight. You will need a flashlight to find the 18 reflectors to find the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The park closes at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Light versus Dark is one story that everyone
thinks they know. The light represents the good; the Dark
represents the bad, however, this is too broad of a statement. Not
all of those who follow the Light can be considered &quot;good,&quot; and
many ‚Äúgood‚Äù people do indeed follow the Dark, you may even know a
few yourself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beneath all of the apparent issues, the Light
and the Dark are very simple. It simply has to do with one's
personal point of view. An individual who sees the world as a bad
place, one who sees nothing good anywhere and who projects that
there is no hope of anything better is someone that has a &quot;dark&quot;
mind. These people are not necessarily followers of the Dark, but
they form the basis of that particular orientation. On the other
hand, an individual who has a positive outlook on life and tries to
find the good in everything and often tries to point out that the
world is not as bad as people think are those who are of the Light.
Neither one of these ways of thinking is necessarily right or
wrong. Both can make good arguments for their points of view, which
is where the problem lies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Over the years, all of the conflicts that have
taken place have somehow been in the form of Light against Dark.
People who had extreme opinions on either side would spark up the
problems. Once the problems had begun, other people, who normally
would have been more in the middle, would choose one side or the
other based on their opinions at that moment in time. Feuds and
animosity would then develop. This is how the problem began. The
designations of &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Dark&quot; started to be used to
differentiate between the two sides for &quot;good and evil&quot; This was
not appropriate, neither side was good or evil so to speak. Now,
keep in mind, it is true that too much light can do as much or more
harm than too much darkness, and, wherever you find one, the other
must surely exist. They are opposites, like north and south, and
there will never be one without the other. They must coexist in
order to balance each other out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a night time only cache, although, if you really wish to try it during the day, feel free to give it a shot. The page coordinates will take you to the starting place for the cache. You WILL NEED a FLASHLIGHT. In fact, I suggest bringing a spare or
extra batteries as this cache may take more than an hour to complete. &lt;i&gt;The park closes at midnight&lt;/i&gt;, so please plan your trip accordingly. You can find parking on the road to the Lebanon Pavillion, across 100 acre drive in the big lot or near the Silent Brook Barn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you arrive at the posted coordinates, use your flashlight to spot the first reflector, which will be north of your position. Once you spot it proceed to it's location, and begin scanning for the next. Some are farther apart than others and may be hard to see with out moving around. I tried to limit the amount of movement but you still will need to encompass about a 10' radius of the current reflector. In all you will visit 16 places with reflectors, with the third stage and the final having two reflectors. When you are standing in between the final 2 reflectors the cache container is approximately 35' at 270 degrees TN. This is where your geosenses will come into play and help you find the Ammo can, which is larger than a .50 cal can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall terrain is not too hard, but I added a half star to a star since it will be night. There are easy ways to get to each reflector, which is not always the most direct way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache does contain 2 prizes - one for the FTF and one for the 2TF. Please take only one of them. They are in the bag with the logbook. In addition to the prizes, there are a lot of trades in the can and they all follow a light theme somehow. There are flashlights, glowsticks, glow in the dark stickers, and a lot of other neat light up objects. Please try to stay on theme when making trades and as always, please sign the logbook with a little bit about your journey to earn that smilie.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FTF honors go to Lindsychris followed closely by Princess
Lisa as 2TF. WTG!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well...we started this one a few of weeks ago. We dragged the kids from reflector to reflector. I am sure that we missed a few along the way, but we made it pretty far. Unfortunately, once we got so far, the kids were too tired to continue. Just as we were about ready to go home, Brian  saw the double reflectors...but wait...the reflectors were moving a little bit. Hey...that's not part of the cache! I was a deer caught in the light of our flashlight. Our hopes crushed, we headed home, and emailed the cache owner to find out how much further we had to go (we were at #13 when the family quit...figures!). Luckily, I thought that I caught another reflector (turns out it was one of the doubles) on the way out, so we went back to this spot, and it was a reflector. We never found the other, but since we knew that we were at the end, we didn't even look for it...just the cache. The kids were thrilled with their goods. We left a flashlight &amp; light-up toy, and took home a sword &amp; some glow-in-the-dark bats. Also snagged the eyeball TB. TFTC! </groundspeak:text>

through South Park.&lt;br /&gt;
I drive past this site nearly every day, and
each time I say to myself, &quot;a P&amp;G cache would be perfect
here.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
So...HERE it is!&lt;br /&gt;
This is a simple offset cache.&lt;br /&gt;
You can park within 20 feet of the posted
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you walk to the coordinates, (which you
will know because of the distinct structure under your feet), set
your GPSr to the compass mode or use a traditional compass.&lt;br /&gt;
Turn to a bearing of 315 degrees and start
walking.&lt;br /&gt;
Keep walking until you run into the familiar
structure we all love to hate.&lt;br /&gt;
YES, it is a GRC. &lt;br /&gt;
The cache container is appropriate for your
surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;
Very small trades are all that will fit. Log
only; bring your own
pen.&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FI2RW2X - Cache location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ </groundspeak:long_description>

located just off of route 19. This cache is a micro. Please be sure
to put it back properly. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On September 8, 1994, ten members of the Upper St. Clair Community
perished on Flight 427 when it crashed in Hopewell Township near
Pittsburgh International Airport. In friendship and support for the
families and friends in our community, the Township of Upper St.
Clair constructed a permanent memorial garden with the hope that a
lasting memorial will comfort the families and honor the deceased.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The groundbreaking ceremony for the garden was held on November 9,
1994. The garden was designed to be a peaceful area along
McLaughlin Run Creek, near the Township Municipal Building. The
memorial garden includes benches, shade trees, perennial beds,
Nordic holly, rhododendrons and a walkway. Please respect the
environment. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will not have to leave the concrete pathway to find this cache.
The cache contains only a log sheet as there is no room for
anything else. Please bring a writing utensil to sign the log and
then gingerly replace the container where you found it. The cache
has been labeled handicapped accessible, however the container may
not be retrievable without assistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks and good luck hunting! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: As always, sign the logsheet for a smilie! Also, please do
not post spoilers in your online log. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
FTF honors went to roygpa with Ruffledostrich coming in a
very close second!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
update: October 2007- the container has been fixed and
there should not be anymore moisture issues. Please make sure the
lid is secure. Thanks and happy hunting!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hi, my name is Kerry and this cache is part of the Kerry,
Karey, Carrie, Kerry puzzle cache. We are all members of PAGA and
have been talking for a few months about each placing a cache that
would contain a clue for a 5th cache. We all live in different
areas, so getting our 4 caches, plus the final puzzle, may take
several trips.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keeping that in mind, my cache is located in Upper St.
Clair and you can make a day of caching in this area while
collecting my part of the puzzle.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is an .50 cal ammo can that started with a bunch
of books and a few other trinkets. Feel free to trade a book if you
would like or even borrow one and return when you are done reading
it. Also included with the logbook is a FTF prize containing some
geocaching things.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To start this search, park at the suggested coords, cross
the bridge and head up behind the batting cages. It may appear that
there is parking closer, but the cache is not accessible from that
parking!!! NOTE THE TERRAIN RATING!! There is no need to go wading
up to your knees in water! Please be safe and enjoy your walk. When
this was placed, there was another cache along the route:
Geocaching 101- Grade 1. If you haven't found it yet, this would be
a great time!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain might be a bit tricky...wouldn't suggest doing
this in a mini skirt wearing flip-flops, but to each his own. There
are some steep spots and on a wet day it could be slippery. Be very
careful. From the parking the cache is less than a quarter of a
mile.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

terrain raised from 2-3 after reading alanfreed's log. In
the growth months this is a nice bushwhack and if you take a wrong
step, you could find yourself going down a big hill! Have
fun!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;USC Rec building parking&lt;br /&gt;N 40¬∞ 20.102 W 080¬∞ 04.433&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerry's Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 40¬∞ 20.070 W 080¬∞ 04.440&lt;br /&gt;Enter the woods here...you might want some bug spray in the warmer months!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The purpose of this cache is to highlight one of the historic locations in our town.  You can park across the road at the municipal building and visit the Veterans Memorial first and then head over to the log house carefully crossing the street.   Please do not enter the high school drive during school hours, there is no need.  Also, there is no parking on the drive, so really no need to enter at any time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fulton Log House (USC Log Home) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alexander Gilfillan, who settled here in the late 1760's built a house and owned, in total, 413 acres. Around 1830, Alexander and his son, John, built four or five log houses as housing for hired men and their families. Just one of these survived- the 1830 Log House which still sits on its original site in the heart of Upper St. Clair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 1899 until 1923, the home changed ownership many times and in 1923 it was purchased by the Fulton family as a summer home. In 1939, it was deeded to Fulton's son, James Grove Fulton who served as the U.S. Congressman from the 27th District of Pennsylvania from 1945 until his death in 1971. A year after his death, his estate sold the house to the Township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the log house stands at the edge of the high school campus, but there is no need to go on campus any further than the cabin.  The cabin serves as a classroom to learn about the past. The house is furnished with articles from the day including furniture, cookwares, toys and lots of pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1830 Log House Association opens the doors to the house a couple of times a year for an open house, once in the fall and once in the spring. The spring open house occurs on USC Community Day which is usually the 3rd Saturday in May.  Please be sure to check the Upper St. Clair municipal site for more details.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To claim a find, please provide the following number:&lt;br/&gt;ABCDEF&lt;br/&gt;A= number of windows&lt;br/&gt;B= number of doors&lt;br/&gt;CDEF= year listed on the plaque on front of house&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

We were in the area teaching a geocaching class, so the time had come to get this (and another) cache. No problems finding the cache, but had to get creative getting around the sea of nettle. I left the girls in a nettle free zone while I retrived the cache. A couple of trades were made before heading out. I wish that I could say that I made it out without any problems, but...let's just say that one of my warning to my class included a discussion about nettle. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

He helped daddy paint the container and then the family headed out to help him find a nice place to hide it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the cache, you can park at Wingfield Pines which is now part of the Allegheny Land Trust and is located on Boyce Mayview Road just across from the entrance to the USC recreational complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walk is more than a quarter mile in each direction but for the most part is fairly level. The beginning (and the return to the car) will be the only elevation change you will meet. Of course, if you want to go straight down, the walk will be shorter, but Red k looked over the edge and definitely wouldn't take that route himself!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are paths and &quot;trails&quot; all the way to the cache, but be careful...if you take a wrong turn, you might wind up WET and icky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun and please enjoy the area. As always, CITO what you can and be respectful to the plants and animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first cache that he has hidden and he hopes you like it!!!  </groundspeak:long_description>

The Outdoor Classroom offers something for everyone, including programs for teachers, students, service groups, government officials, business leaders, and community residents. Visit their website to find out more!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed by PAGA in conjunction with The Outdoor Classroom to recognize our newly formed alliance and our first collaborative event in October, 2011. It is a short walk from parking and can be found alone or as the start of a great day of caching in the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container was created by thebuddhaman and given to renruts who needed a good place to hide it. They thought this would be the perfect place. It is a small cylindrical tupperware container that has a logbook and some trade items to start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to the cache, enter Boyce-Mayview at the Community and Recreation Center entrance on Mayview Road and veer to the left to travel towards the Parking Coordinates. You can then walk towards the classroom and take a right around the trees. At times there might be a slight water hazard to cross, but, regardless of water, you will have to go down a slight incline and up the other side. Please be gentle with the cache and remember to hide it exactly as you found it. We hope you find this to be a fun cache! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit www.theoutdoorclassroom.com for more information about The Outdoor Classroom! </groundspeak:long_description>

The walk is about a tenth of a mile with a bit of an elevation change. At certain times of day, the area will be full of muggles, but that shouldn't be a problem, although, you might get some strange looks while walking between the courts. If anyone says anything, tell them what you are doing and educate a muggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 parking areas, so if the court lot is full, cross the street and park at the soccer field. On that note, Saturday mornings during soccer season might be really tough to find a spot! After you park, you will want to cross the covered bridge and follow the path to the left and then turn right between the courts and up the stairs. Once you get to the top, you will be entering the woods and muggles shouldn't be an issue, but still be careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was placed with 2 FTF prizes, please take the appropriate one and feel free to take an information card if you are unfamiliar with what the second prize is for. There were also many trade items of varying values, so bring some swag with you...you might see something you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget to bring a notepad with you (or camera) so that you can collect the information needed for OXRGCV ~ 'Owney' and as always, don't forget to sign the logbook!! If the pens don't work and you don't have one, find a stick and a leaf and leave your mark!</groundspeak:long_description>

She has been on the go ever since! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hide is a camoflauged Lock-n-Lock in a nice little hiding place just over the edge. Enjoy the park, and replace it as you found it! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a recent trip to Nevada, she achieved #1000 (0468-E.T.) on a desolate road called the E.T. Highway. Not soon after this milestone, she commented, &quot; I've found more caches today than I found in all the time I have been geocaching...&quot; The next day, at 1468-E.T., she found # 2000!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are looking forward to seeing where she will be for #4000 and beyond. You Go Girl!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park entrance and parking lot is at the end of Robson Drive in Upper St. Clair.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;There used to be a cache in this location called ‚ÄúReal Riehl Tiny Cache‚Äù ( GC1F3HE ). This was the first cache I had ever found. My sister ( AKA The Nails ) and I looked for over an hour for this cache that now we would make short work of. It was a lot of fun. When I saw that this cache was archived I knew I had to take matters into my own hands. So I planted this Ode to Real Riehl Tiny Cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Original Description**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a real tiny cache. Just sign your name, don't worry about the date. Be sure to log online too. There is a very small playground here, a ball field and soccer ball field. Please be sure to put this back exactly the way you found it! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You were one of the few good parts of that job K.D.B.M.C.J. and to all the Plant Ops guys. This cache is in an Annexed location with a nice view. Can be a PNG if you want to pay for parking ($2  need token from hospital ) or you can park for free and walk down from the lot near the dermatology clinic on Segar Rd.  The cache is a good place for travel bugs and makes a good night Cache area is well lit and fewer muggles  but is not available when there is snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was one of the world's leading steel producers and eventually the world's largest employee owned (ESOP) company. Now it lies (nearly) dormant...a sad reminder of what we've let slip out of our country. Hope you enjoy the view - (reminiscent of 'Reckless' (the movie), probably the best view of the sleeping giant, which will rise again some day).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be discrete, there may be muggles around (though not that common for others to walk the path).

Park at the Park Office area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was originally a small-ish plastic spice jar covered in black duct tape but apparently we didn't clean it good enough and some critter wanted to eat it. So we placed a small plastic storage bin covered in camo duct tape. This was hidden by my son nka Well-Seeker (D).  He wanted it to be just about impossible to find but I encouraged him to make the hunt challenging yet reasonable.  (He wanted to climb 8-10 ft up a tree and hide the cache up there... I talked him out of it. phew.)  So after some compromising (on his part) and explaining (on my part) - I think we came up with an interesting location.  There are a couple of different ways to approach this cache from the parking lot but you will have to venture off the beaten walking path to get to it.  There shouldn't be too much bushwacking required as the area has a lot of ATV trails you can follow.   We were getting some variable readings on the GPSr so I will tell you the cache is in a tree (don't worry it is at ground level).  If you spot a &quot;Naked&quot; tree, you are close.  Need more help... see the hint. </groundspeak:long_description>

If you are an early finder there are a couple of nickels and several pennies that were custom smashed by the Indiana Railroad in southern Indiana (state).  No need to trade for a smashed coin.  Take one.  This area is highly visible but I don't think people are going be eager to run up and see what you are/were up to (muggle).

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After receiving some advice on this cache from a respected cacher we have decided to up the terrain and add that you should &lt;b&gt;BE CAREFUL&lt;/b&gt; while attempting this. It is potentially &lt;b&gt;DANGEROUS&lt;/b&gt; and you should use your own judgement before attempting. &quot;special tools&quot; are optional at your own discretion, so bring them along if you have them. We also added another spoiler pic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is one of a small series of caches we hid along this old County Road. Many signs of what used to be, along this road. Varying levels of terrain to the different caches, but the old road bed is level and will take you past all of them. Hope you enjoy finding these as much as we did hiding them!</groundspeak:long_description>

The area can be accessed from Route 19, both Northbound and Southbound. Just check a road map to plan accordingly for safe driving.</groundspeak:long_description>

We give much thanks to logsplitter1 for all the  time and effort he puts into hiding caches. We have really enjoyed finding every one and look forward to another 100. If we could just start finding them as fast as he hides them we might be able to catch up a little but thats a tall order. We spotted this blue beauty just hanging out where the coords took us and signed it quick. Thanks again logsplitter1 and GeoPiper too! TFTC's!!! SLWBP.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for a PURPLE container a little larger than a bison tube. I bought some energy drink mix that came in this tube and I just KNEW that it was screaming cache container!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, I got a job in this area and of course I wanted to start grabbing Smileys as soon as I arrived. Much to my amusement, I see that my RED and BLUE friends from PAGA have many, many, many color-coded caches in the area (I have logged several such smileys already)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have been talking about caching in the office and have hooked one colleague who in turn went out and hooked another! There is a cache just up the hill (GC26QQQ) that was the first find for both of these guys. I thought it would be fun to put out another one that is within 500 yards of the office and see how long it would take for them to find it. If I am going to do that anyway, how much fun would it be to make it color themed and see whether my RED or BLUE friend gets to it first...... or perhaps one of my PURPLE friends will swoop in first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the fun begin!!&lt;br/&gt;===============================================&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to jreeher for his first FTF!!  And thanks to Grinder79 for joining in the hunt and introducing new players to our obsession!</groundspeak:long_description>

BYOP      &lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to &quot;FreundFamily&quot; on the FTF!!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tucked into steep-sided valleys along the Ohio River and spanning the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border, the 130-acre &quot;Little Blue Run&quot; lake was opened in 1975 to store coal-combustion waste from the 2,490-megawatt Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in Shippingport, 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The power plant burns 7 million tons of coal annually and is connected to Little Blue by a seven-mile underground pipe that carries 625,000 tons of fly ash and bottom ash to the reservoir each year.&lt;br/&gt;Little Blue is one of seven permitted coal ash disposal reservoirs in the state but the only one in the southwestern region.&lt;br/&gt;The reservoir was scheduled to close in 2008. But after getting state approval in 2006 to make the impoundment up to 62 feet higher by stacking coal ash behind small dikes built on top of already solidified ash, its closing date was pushed back until 2031 or beyond.</groundspeak:long_description>

Ok thanks to F-eagle eye-S's post and clarification on the original
cache name, I changed the name of the cache from Shale to
Slate....sorry I never paid attention in rock class&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I've changed this one to a 35mm on a rope, hiden along a trail
that parallels the Connoquenessing Creek in Harmony. Considering
the name this one should give be a dead giveaway put the GPS away
and enjoy the walk along this nice trail. Please replace as hidden
or atleast in a way it cannot easily be seen from the
trail.&lt;/b&gt;

This should be a pretty easy find, just keep an eye out for muggles. It's located pretty close to the trail so you may need some stealth on this one

The Mennonite Meetinghouse pictured is where Harmony's
Mennonites built their stone meetinghouse back in 1825, and right
next to a cemetery. It is said to be the oldest Mennonite
meetinghouse west of the Alleghenies, so enjoy a little bit of
history while in he area.

first official visit to the United States earlier this year. The
purpose of course being to help President Nixon's administration
stop the evil Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Doctor enjoyed his time here so much he decided to
return again with all of his most recent companions. However the
TARDIS experienced some technical difficulties and crashed
somewhere in the Valley. The Doctor was able to get all his
companions to safety but has since gone missing. Your mission is to
track down the Doctor's six companions who each hold a clue to the
Doctor's location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each companion's cache has a letter written on the inside of the
lid. Be sure to record which letter was found in which lid. Once
you have found all six companion caches you should be able to find
the location of the Doctor (GC2XC1G).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Companion Caches are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Rose Tyler (GC2XC1B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Martha Jones (GC2XC19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: River Song (GC2XC17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Donna Noble (GC2XC14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Capt. Jack Harkness (GC2XC16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Amy Pond (GC2XC11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Final Cache is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Just the Doctor (GC2XC1g)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capt. jack landed near the southern end of the East Golf Road
Hike and Bike Trail. In true Jack fashion he was last spotted
hanging out not to far away from the unisex bathroom just down the
trail from the parking lot. The cache is a small camo plastic
cylinder. Very little bushwhacking will be involved with finding
this cache so long as you come in from the right direction. The
best parking for this cache would be the trail parking lot off of
224. Remember this park closes at dusk so absolutely NO night
caching. Also, you assume all risk when searching for this cache.
Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

There are many graves here dating back to the early 1800s as well as more modern ones. You will be looking for a camo 35mm film can. Please respect the area and follow all posted rules. Please do not seek this cache when services are being held. NO NIGHT CACHING! Shorter cachers may require the help of a taller friend to reach this cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK folks, rather than just complain about the coordinates being off why not post the coordinates you get for the final location. I have checked this one with several GPS units on several days and they all take em right to the cache. Additionally, others have also said they take them right to the cache. So please, if you are having issues with the coordinates please post the ones you got as well as what type of GPS you are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha managed to land in the woods near the parking lot on West
Golf Drive that is used to access the East Golf Drive Hike and Bike
Trail. This cache is nearly a cache and dash. HOWEVER, the woods is
very open around here so one must be very very stealthy to avoid
muggle attention. The cache is a small camo plastic jar. The park
closes at dusk so absolutely NO night caching. Also you assume all
risk associated with going after this cache. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

THERE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As any good Doctor Who fan can tell you, the Doctor made his
first official visit to the United States earlier this year. The
purpose of course being to help President Nixon's administration
stop the evil Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Doctor enjoyed his time here so much he decided to
return again with all of his most recent companions. However the
TARDIS experienced some technical difficulties and crashed
somewhere in the Valley. The Doctor was able to get all his
companions to safety but has since gone missing. Your mission is to
track down the Doctor's six companions who each hold a clue to the
Doctor's location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each companion's cache has a letter written on the inside of the
lid. Be sure to record which letter was found in which lid. Once
you have found all six companion caches you should be able to find
the location of the Doctor (GC2XC1G).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Companion Caches are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Rose Tyler (GC2XC1B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Martha Jones (GC2XC19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: River Song (GC2XC17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Donna Noble (GC2XC14)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Capt. Jack Harkness (GC2XC16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Amy Pond (GC2XC11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have located the six companions of the doctor and they
have shared their secrets, you will need to use the information
below to locate the Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For A subtract 7 from the final digit of the north coordinates
of the cache with the A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For B subtract 4 from the final digit of the north coordinates
of the cache with the B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For C subtract 4 from the final digit of the north coordinate of
the cache with the C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For D add 2 to the final digit of the west coordinates of the
cache with the D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For E add 0 to the final digit of the west coordinates of the
cache with the E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For F add 2 to the final digit of the west coordinates of the
cache with the F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Final coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 41*04.ABC, W 080* 43.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=9dfa0912d929c3403205b4d41d55b90c&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433258433147&amp;amp;name=44722057686f3a204a7573742074686520446f63746f72&quot;&gt;
Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done your math correctly, you should end up with the
Doctors location. You should be able to reach the Doctor with
little bushwhacking and few muggle encounters. This area can get a
bit cluttered with junk form time to time so feel free to practice
CITO. As always you assume all risk when going after this cache.
There should be No night caching at this location. I hope you have
enjoyed the Doctor Who series. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

White who taught Anthropology at the nearby Youngstown State University for many years and led the excavation of the Mill Creek Furnace which you will be viewing and learning about shortly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT CLIMB ON OR IN THE RUINS OF THE FURNACE! THE CACHE IS NOT LOCATED ON OR IN THE FURNACE! CLIMBING IN OR AROUND THE FURNACE IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL BUT VERY VERY DANGEROUS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS STRUCTURE IS NOT REINFORCED IN ANY WAY AND COULD COME TUMBLING DOWN WITHOUT MUCH HELP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 March 2011, the cache has been replaced and fixed so it should not go missing again. Also added an ID sticker so very important that it is hidden with that side covered. Please make sure to hide container very well when finished. New log so new first to find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that we have gotten the warning out of the way we can move onto the issue which has drawn you to this interesting site. The ruins of the furnace that sit before you are all that remains of the birth of Youngstown's legacy. To uncover the resting place of this cache you are going to have to learn a bit about the furnace and its neighbor, the Pioneer Pavilion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final coordinates: N 41¬∞ 0A.0BC W 080¬∞ D.E&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin by walking around the Pioneer Pavilion until you find a dated stone above a door. Add the last digit of each year to the value of A. Now for values B and C head over to the Mill Creek Furnace side of the state historical marker. Two years are given spanning the time period in which the furnace is believed to have been built. The second to last digit of the first year is the value of B and the second to last digit of the second year minus two, is the value of C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the value of D examine the other side of the marker which discusses the Pioneer Pavilion. The value of D is the same as the second decade in which the Pavilion was believed to have been converted into storage. Finally, to obtain the value of E, look back at the furnace side of the marker and find the the second of two years in which the furnace is believed to have gone out of operation. Take the second listed year and subtract 1018 from the year to get the value of E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If done correctly, you should now be able to locate the cache which is a well hidden 35mm film can. Please be careful to replace the cache as you found it so that it will not be muggled in this busy park.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Dr Who: Just the Doctor (GC2XC1g)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rose landed near the Ford Nature Center and can be reached
easily from the trail that leads from the parking lot there. Little
to no bushwhacking will be required if you choose the correct game
trail that intersects the nature trail. The cache is an ammo can
size camo plastic cylinder. Since this one is near the trails
stealth is a must! Be sure to check out the nature center if it is
open when you find this one. Also the park closes at dusk so
absolutely NO night caching! As with any cache, you seek this one
at your own risk. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

inside is not SWAG but is for stamping a letterboxing log book. DO
NOT TAKE THE STAMP!&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have already found the other caches in this series you
know that the Dr. has recently begun his first official visit to
our fair county. You also know that during this visit their were
some problems with the TARDI (Time And Relative Dimension In
Space). Thankfully the Dr. has finally returned from the local
hardware store with the items he needs to repair the TARDIS.
Unfortunately, during his absences, the TARDIS has moved to a new
location, as she has been known to do from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission is to help the Dr. locate the new location of the
TARDIS. When he left she was parked near the statue of Vollney
Rogers in Mill Creek Park. Through the use of his sonic
screwdriver, the Dr. has been able to obtain the new location of
the TARDIS at the coordinates posted above. Please help the Dr.
recover his beloved TARDIS, but DO NOT REMOVE the STAMP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As thanks, the Dr. has left several special prizes inside TARDIS
for those that have helped him on his way. For the first to find
their is a free pass to the Youngstown Museum of Industry and
Labor. Additionally, the Dr. has also left several small ready to
go cache containers. Due to the fact that his previous companions
are currently off exploring the area the Dr. is on the lookout for
individuals who are willing to help him on his many adventures. If
you would like to take one of these containers, all that he ask is
that you please name it Dr. Who: (your screen name. You are not
required to take one of these containers but if you do so please
name it as such and take care of the cache. The Dr. also ask that
you send him a message with the name and code for the new cache so
that he can keep an up to date list of his new companions on this
page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this cache is located inside Mill Creek Park so NO
night caching. The area where this cache has been hidden is very
steep and lacks official trails. Depending on which direction you
approach this cache from the terrain could be a 2 or 4. By going
after this cache you accept all responsibilities. Finally, the
TARDIS is hidden well off the beaten path so that it can remain
safe from muggles. A great deal of time went into creating the
cache container, as you will see when you find it, so please,
please make sure to rehide the cache so that it is not visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks goes out to the fine people who work at the Austintown
and Cornersberg Walgreens who were nice enough to save some of the
small containers for this cache. Additional thanks goes to
Phillips68 who I roped into helping with the placement of this
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy landed just west of Lake Glacier, between a ridge line and a
hiking trail. The cache you are searching for is a camo plastic
cylinder similar in size to an ammo can. Some bushwhacking will be
involved regardless of how you choose to approach this cache. The
best parking can be found in the parking lot off of West Glacier
Drive. Also the hill side can be slippery when wet so do be
careful. The park closes at dusk so absolutely NO night caching.
Also, you assume all risk while seeking this cache. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out I also forgot to post this cache for several months.  After checking to make sure it was still there I decided to finally publish this one.  THE CACHE IS NOT LOCATED NEAR ANY OF THE STONES.  DO NOT MOVE ANY OF THE STONES!  BE RESPECTFUL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best parking would be either at the cemetery to the north of this one or near the hidden drive sign.  You are looking for a small clear lock lock with a few trade items and a log.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cemetery is far older than the one just to the north.  Based on the dates that I could still read it seems that the last person to be entered here died in the mid to early 1800s.  Please be very respectful of these historic graves.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to get a better idea of what some of them say I would suggest bringing along some wax paper and a crayon.  place the wax paper on the stone and rub the crayon gently on the paper to reveal the long lost writing.  This will not hurt the stones and may actually reveal some of the beautiful faded carvings.  There is to be no night cache and please be respectful and practice CITO.  Also please feel free to snap some photos of the various stones and any rubbings you make so that we may all enjoy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to:  goalie003 and his son.</groundspeak:long_description>

The only help I will give you on this cache is that you will need tweezers to get the log out. ¬†Please be sure to replace just as you found it as this is a very high muggle area and I do not want to have to make a second container for this cache. ¬†Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find the cache please do not tell others what it is as this would ruin the surprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to:  Isherhouse!

Well a few days ago my curiosity got the better of me and I just had to stop to check this one out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden just inside an old cemetery that contains the Earthly remains of some of the local founders and their families.  The cemetery is located in the last place one would expect to find one.  A few years back the cemetery was repaired by some local Boy Scouts as part of their Eagle Scout project.  Please be respectful of those who rest here.  You will be looking for a small camo bottle hidden just inside the stone wall for the cemetery.  The best way to enter the cemetery is over the stone steps, though this will be challenging due to the bush that has started to grow over the steps.  Feel free to take pictures but do not touch the stones as they are very old.  NO NIGHT CACHING!  Also please practice CITO as the area seems to collect garbage from the nearby business.  Additional information about the cemetery can be found at the following website:&lt;br/&gt;http://youngstown-genealogy-website.tripod.com/lanmoh.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to:  Skibug9 &amp; farmgirl4266!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is my first cache.  I gave this an overall rating of 2.5 only because this is a very high muggle area so you will have to be very stealthy to grab this one undetected.  This cache is accessible 24 hours a day but I would advise against night caching this one.  Please do not damage any school property.  You will not need to dismantle anything to find this one.  This is a small round container, about half the height of a 35mm film can.  Only the smallest of trades will fit inside this one, nothing bigger than small coins.

Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to:   Bigdaddy Mark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the new piece being to near another cache, the cache is hidden near another nearby piece of art.  Please take time to check out both.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a copy from a local news source about this new work of art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new art sculpture at Youngstown State University named &quot;Mallorca VII&quot; was officially unveiled Thursday afternoon.  The piece is by internationally renowned artist Betty Gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I do most of my work for universities and museums,&quot; said Gold.  &quot;That's where my heart is.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold has sculptures all over the world, including Spain, Italy, even New York City. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular piece was donated by Sue and Marty Solomon of Vienna.  They say the university setting is the perfect home for the hand welded 6 foot tall structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I think that's what the university provides too,&quot; said Sue Solomon.  &quot;They get people that think outside of the box, and are excited about approaching any challenge from a different path.  And she's a perfect example of that for the univeristy.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the sculpture, the Solomon's also donated a painting of Gold's that now hangs outside of YSU's Ford Theater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold says the reason she enjoys having her pieces displayed on college campuses around the globe is fairly simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;It's real important to know something about the arts, know something about music, know something about education,&quot; she said.  &quot;And even if you don't become an artist, and you carry on, that should be part of your life.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University leaders hope this type of artwork can aid with inspiring students as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What we have outside is an example of public art,&quot; said Bryan DePoy, dean of the college of fine and performing arts.  &quot;What's important is that the students know that their art is visible, appreciated, and certainly acknowledged.  And pieces of art that are outside certainly serve that roll.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new sculpture is located between the McDonough Museum of Art and Bliss Hall, right on Wick avenue.&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 2011 WKBN All rights reserved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck with your search.  I hope you enjoy the new addition to our beautiful campus.  If you have time I suggest you step inside the near by building to view the painting she donated.  You should also take a look at some of the other outdoor installations near the museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USE STEALTH! There are many muggles around, curious college students, faculty, etc. that will wonder what you are doing. Try you best to look for this cache on weekends, early evenings, or in-between classes (if you know the class schedule).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temporary parking is available at the McDonough Art Museum, however, park at your own risk in other locations.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The Enigma Machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1122.photobucket.com/albums/l534/shaved_ewok/?action=view&amp;amp;current=Enigma.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the course of finding this cache you will learn about and how to use an Enigma Machine like the one pictured above. This information can be found at the following site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmasim.htm&quot;&gt;Enigma Simulator&lt;/a&gt; Additionally, an online version of the simulator can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://startpad.googlecode.com/hg/labs/js/enigma/enigma-sim.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site will tell you all you need to know to solve this puzzle as well as provide you with a digital Enigma Machine to use to crack the coded message. Now there are several sites on the internet that offer similar programs, and you are welcome to try to use one of them, but the only one that I know for sure that can be used is found at this site. Additionally, the tutorial located at this site greatly simplifies the use of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK then here is the message you need to crack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JYVZG GASWY RCQVJ ZHXOX HYBFN JNHTX ZMETE FPLCT QNNCX DXXNN VMPLG KEJSL RXUJI ICAFW FYLOA GYTCB GDIOX FTQGD BVZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple I will give you a few bits of information. First, you will need to use the B 3-rotor Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe model of the simulator, which is the default model the simulator is set to use. Second, I have removed the Kenngruppen setting part of the set up to make this cache a bit easier to complete. For the sake of this cache you will only have to figure out which three letters the rotors should be set to when you start. Finally, all the information you need to crack the code and discover the final coordinates can be found on this page. I have also decided to include a checker at the bottom of the page to help you verify that you have received the proper message. If you require additional help you may e-mail, but I must see signs that you have tried to crack the code first. It is highly recommended that you read through the how to use section on the simulator before attempting to crack the code. Remember, it took the Allies capturing these devices and their code books to finally break these codes. Luckily for you that part has been done for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code page you will use to crack the coded message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have cracked the code you must travel to the campus of YSU to find the cache and claim the smiley. The log will be checked regularly, and finds without signatures will be deleted. Please do not reveal the location of the final to others because that only cheapens the value of your handwork and find. Finally, just because you cracked the Enigma code doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of this cache will be easy. The container you are looking for is a small camo bison tube. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was originally placed by GOOLEBUG and as much of the original that could be salvaged was preserved, including the original final cache container and logbook.  This cache was in such a beautiful location and to well done to be aloud to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three leg multi-cache&lt;br/&gt;Just over a 1/2 mile walk total&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 1802 to about 1817, this was the homesite of William Holmes McGuffey (1800-1873), College professor and author, whose elementary school texts--the ECELECTIC READERS--were used for more than 70 years in schools in every part of the United States. Donated to the Millcreek MetroParks in 1998 by the William Holmes McGuffey Historical Society, this 78-acre retreat is located on McGuffey Road in Coitsville Township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The poem below is from one of Mr. mcGuffey's Readers.  I chose to included this poem because I can still remember my great grandfather reciting this poem from memory on his 75th birthday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.&lt;br/&gt;1. Under a spreading chestnut tree&lt;br/&gt;The village smithy stands,&lt;br/&gt;The smith, a mighty man is he,&lt;br/&gt;With large and sinewy hands`;&lt;br/&gt;And the muscles of his brawny arms&lt;br/&gt;Are strong as iron bands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. His hair is crisp, and black, and long`;&lt;br/&gt;His face is like the tan`;&lt;br/&gt;His brow is wet with honest sweat;&lt;br/&gt;He earns whate'er he can`,&lt;br/&gt;And looks the whole world in the face,&lt;br/&gt;For he owes not any man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Week in', week out` from morn' till nigh`.&lt;br/&gt;You can hear his bellows blow`;&lt;br/&gt;You can hear him swing his heavy sledge&lt;br/&gt;With measured beat and slow`,&lt;br/&gt;Like a sexton ringing the village bell,&lt;br/&gt;When the evening sun is low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. And children coming home from school&lt;br/&gt;Look in at the open door`;&lt;br/&gt;They love to see the flaming forge',&lt;br/&gt;And hear the bellows roar`,&lt;br/&gt;And catch the burning sparks that fly&lt;br/&gt;Like chaff from a threshing-floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. He goes, on Sunday, to the church,&lt;br/&gt;And sits among his boys`;&lt;br/&gt;He hears the parson pray and preach`,&lt;br/&gt;He hears his daughter's voice,&lt;br/&gt;Singing in the village choir,&lt;br/&gt;And it makes his heart rejoice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. It sounds to him like her mother's voice,&lt;br/&gt;Singing in Paradise`!&lt;br/&gt;He needs must think of her once more,&lt;br/&gt;How in the grave she lies`;&lt;br/&gt;And with his hard, rough hand he wipes&lt;br/&gt;A tear out of his eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,&lt;br/&gt;Onward through life he goes`;&lt;br/&gt;Each morning sees some task begin,&lt;br/&gt;Each evening sees it c!ose`,&lt;br/&gt;Something attempted, something done,&lt;br/&gt;Has earned a night's repose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Thanks`, thanks to thee, my worthy friend',&lt;br/&gt;For the lesson thou hast taught`!&lt;br/&gt;Thus, at the flaming forge of life',&lt;br/&gt;Our fortunes must be wrought`,&lt;br/&gt;Thus, on its sounding anvil', shaped&lt;br/&gt;Each burning deed and thought`.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H.W.

I found this in October. I think I mistakenly wrote September when I went back to the cache today I brought a pen.. 
I left something too. I think there was a dinosaur before that is now gone. Maybe others have found it but not had a pen to leave a note.
Happy hunting Rabbits!</groundspeak:text>

I could not believe this course was being overlooked.  The container is a plastic cylinder that has been painted a flat green.  The best way to find this cache without standing out would be to play a round on the course.  There are no fees for playing on this course.  If you are new to the idea of disk golf you can pick up a set of disk at the campus book store or at the drug store just down the road on Mahoning.</groundspeak:long_description>

As soon as I started looking someone came out the door and sat in their car.  Oh great.  Luckily after about 5 minutes the other party that belonged to the car came out and they drove off.  Once I was able to search with out being stealthy I was able to make a pretty quick find.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

The needed water may be located so far away from where it is needed that a fire department's ability to control the fire is impaired. Mobile water supply vehicles can move water from distant sources, but the critical factor is whether or not the fire department can maintain an uninterrupted supply of a predictable rate of water at the fire scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installation of dry hydrants into nearby and developed water supplies eliminates the inefficiency and complexity of long-distance water shuttle operations. This arrangement also allows access to water sources from a roadway instead of having to work on soft ground immediately adjacent to the pond or stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any area without water mains and domestic fire hydrants, the dry hydrant concept can provide a simple, cost-effective solution to the need for rapid access to water sources. A dry hydrant consists of an arrangement of piping with one end in the water and the other end extending to dry land and available for connection to a pumper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dry hydrants have the following features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢Use a non-pressurized pipe system.&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢Use relatively inexpensive piping materials and other supplies.&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢Are permanently installed in existing lakes, ponds, streams and cisterns.&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢Provide a means of access whenever needed, regardless of weather.&lt;br/&gt;‚Ä¢Allow years of simple operation with a minimum of maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It eased up quite a bit when we found the entrance to the cemetery but started up again once we got close to the cache.  Mrs.uccacher spotted it from the road and I drove right up to it.  Just like fireref, we had to use something to coax it out of it's hiding spot.  Luckily I had my multi-tool which did the trick.  It looks like there are now about 3 residents here.

On the way to the next cache it started to pour and the poor people on their loud motorcycles with no helmets looked like they were really suffering.  At least I couldn't hear the roar of their illegal exhausts over the pounding of the rain.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

Luckily I was able to kick the white stuff out of the way and make the find. I'd call this one not winter friendly even though it is right now since I cleared the snow away. I mixed this one up with #4 since the names and descriptions aren't very descriptive on the first hides in this series.  #4 was buried too deep so I didn't even get out to look.

During there drive they got to this corner and my friend didnt see the STOP sign. He was hit by an SUV on the driver side of his van at 70+ mph. 3 boys and the little girl were ejected from the van. The 2 boys died instantly. Sal JR. was 13 and Anthony was 8. The little girl was thrown into the nearby woods and only suffered a small cut. It has been almost 3 years, but it still seems like yesterday. This is a memorial cache for those 2 boys. When you go to this cache please look at those 2 lonley crosses and think how short life can actually be. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I didn't have my GPSr with me but I did have my iPhone.  Then again, I didn't need that either because I'd been here before for Kiawa's cache.  The snow was about knee deep at the edge of the road and in the dip, but that didn't stop me.  Found the goose first and then moved to the other side and found the cache.  Took a Green Jeep that hadn't been logged in to the cache and hadn't been logged in almost three years.  All of the other bugs/coins are there except for the Yellow Jeep.  That was the main reason I stopped.  Oh well.  I got a green one.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This was our third year at Splash Lagoon, and we look forward to coming back to Erie next year.  I was hoping to get more caching in while I was here, but I was wiped out by the end of each day!

The Nature reserve across the road had some concerns about cachers going off the trail and disturbing the wildlife. Small container room for some trackables, log and pen included.

This pavilion houses several musicians over the course of the summer months. Hosting free concerts and  is the summertime venue for the Port Dover ukulele club.  This park is also home to many other artisans who come to share their crafts. This park is centrally located in downtown Dover and parking is available on the street. This is a grab and go. Watch for muggles there are lots of avid dog walkers about. FTF gets change for a coffee and a super ball. Bring your own pen. This is the first time that we have hidden a cache we will be looking after it regularly any comments or suggestions to improve our cache hiding is appreciated. </groundspeak:long_description>

only. Use your own pen to sign the log. Replace the cache as found
and beware of muggles. May be better early am or late pm Plenty of

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The posted co-ordinates are for the parking area. You really
want to park here since you need some nearby information. The
actual cache location is determined after you visit a series of
virtual caches to arrive at the final co-ordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my Mother (Eunice) out geocaching about a month before I
placed this cache and she really had fun with it. So, for my first
cache placement, I decided to do it near her home in Tillsonburg.
This is now her little secret - a Tupperware container that started
with the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log book and Pencil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Tim Horton's Gift Certificate for the First Finder. Use it at
N42¬∞ 51.584' W80¬∞ 43.366'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A disposable camera. Naturally this is for you to take a
picture of your geocaching team. I'll develop the film and post the
photos once the camera is full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A kaleidoscope lens toy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A LED keychain light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 
Mocha's Goldfish Travelbug&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located along a stretch of the Trans Canada Trail
as it meanders through the heart of the town that Tobacco built.
Since the trend away from cigarettes, the area has become a major
Ginseng producer, but you'll still find plenty of tobacco fields
outside town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All co-ordinates start with N42¬∞ and W80¬∞ so we're going to skip
those digits for the math, and we'll do away with that pesky
decimal till the end of each calculation too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get out of your car, look around. If you've parked at
the posted co-ordinates, you should see a vehicle that won't be
moving anywhere soon.&lt;br /&gt;
 This vehicle has a couple buildings nearby that would be related
to it if it could move. Inside those buildings you can go in and
learn about the history of Tillsonburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a note of the number printed on the side of this vehicle
(digits only, we don't care about the alphabetic characters). We'll
call this number &quot;A&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate stage two, perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;


North Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ __ (A)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Add 33679&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 N42¬∞ __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

West Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ __ (A)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Add 26053&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Transfer to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 W 80¬∞ __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. As an error check, the next stage is within
600M of the Parking Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short walk, you should find yourself within a few feet
of a sign that has an animal on it. Look for a number at the bottom
right corner of this sign. We'll call this number &quot;B&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate stage three, perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the digits that make up &quot;B&quot; and add them together to
produce &quot;C&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


North Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ (B)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Multiply by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 __ __ (C)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 = D __ __ __ __ __ (D)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 + 5278&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;= __ __ __ __ __&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 N42¬∞ __ __ . __ __ __'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

West Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 __ __ __ __ __ (D)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Subtract 2227&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Transfer to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 W 80¬∞ __ __ . __ __ __'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Three&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stage three there are no numbers printed to write down.
Instead you're counting. At the location you calculated in Stage
Two, there is a structure. Simply count the number of supports this
structure has (at contact with the ground), and assign that to
&quot;E&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the location of the final, here's the math to stop you
from cheating, we're going to use a number from Stage Two in the
calculation.&lt;/p&gt;


North Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ (E)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Multiply by B&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;F&quot; = __ __ __ __ __&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Add 7932&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 N42¬∞ __ __ . __ __ __'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

West Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ __ (F)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Add 347&lt;br /&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Transfer to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 W 80¬∞ __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it! Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1) The number is white on red.
2) Think Fido.
3) Best view is a wet one
4) If a tree falls in the forest, will someone place a cache in it?

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Simrebel was here new container and new log,  What I had planned didn't work out
so had to leave the same kind of container.

Will try to come up with something to make it a little more weather proof
hopefully in the meantime cachers can make sure the zip lock bag and cache lid is closed before putting it back

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located right along the river, this cache is accessed from Highway 54 through the small gate near the front of the church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St. Paul's Anglican church is quite fascinating, as it is one of the few wooden Anglican churches in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wooden Anglican churches in Ontario of the second half of the 19th century are not plentiful. In the first place, rich, large and/or more ambitious congregations opted to build their churches in stone or brick rather than wood because a masonry edifice was seen to be more permanent. Secondly, wooden edifices were more susceptible to destruction by fire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survival of St Paul's Anglican Church in the village of Middleport is therefore quite remarkable. The History of Brant County published in 1883, records that St Paul's was 'erected during the year of 1868, on an eligible plot of ground, the gift of Robert Wade, Esq.'. The church is described as 'A neat frame building with tower and bell, its value being $1,500'. St Paul's was consecrated in 1880 by Isaac Hellmuth (1817-1901), Bishop of Huron (1871-1883).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The church history informs us that St Paul's was erected 'under the direction of Reverend Adam Elliott' but the name of the architect is not recorded. Be that as it may, it is clear that the person was well informed about ecclesiological principles of Anglican Church design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The church also backs onto the Grand River, and this is a great spot to take pics from. The cache is a small sized jar with a screw top lid, with logbook, swag and pen. Please leave the logbook and pen in the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small cemetery located along Highway 54 in Tuscarora Township, not far from Chiefswood Rd. It is named for the Jamieson Family, a very predominant name in the area, particularly on the Six Nations reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small cemetery hosts 20 monuments, 19 of which have the last name Jamieson on them, 8 of which are part of a family plot in the centre of the burial ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to access the cache, there is no need to enter the cemetery. There is a short trail (about 10m) straight past the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available on the side of Highway 54, although if your vehicle is much larger than mine, you will want to park on the NORTH side of 54 in the small parking lot. Please take care in crossing the road as cars do tend to speed down this stretch. Also please be careful as ticks are VERY prominent this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a regular sized lock and lock container, camo-taped and then hidden. Please rehide as well as or better than you found it. Even thought there is a pen in the cache, I always suggest bringing one, just in case (especially in winter when pens tend to freeze).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a fairly straightforward cache, with parking about 50m from the cache. However, you may have a heck of a time getting down the trail, as the trail is filled with thorns, fallen trees and eventually has you almost walking into a creek. Wllies/rubber boots are recommended after rainfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, while out driving from the barn to Caledonia for dinner after a hard ride, I took a wrong turn and ended up finding this little bridge, that seemed like the perfect place for a cache. I pulled off onto the side of the road and got out to explore. Down the trail I went, scraping my back as I climbed under a 2 1/2 foot wide downed tree. Got to the edge of the water and found where I wanted to place the cache... a place that required me to straddle a tree, and almost fall off the side of the bank to place it. What that means: you're going to have fun retrieving it. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's in the obvious spot, just please be careful while signing the log book. We don't want anyone riding home with wet feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please leave the logbook and pen in the cache - there is lots of other swag for trading. Thanks.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Have you ever had one of those weeks where NOTHING goes right? Injuries, bad marks in school, not enough hours in a day, DNFs and lack of financial means to do anything... you know those weeks where you just want to sit down and cry? Well, I am having one of those weeks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so, today to try and clear my head I went for a nice long walk by the river, placing a few caches while I was out. It's really amazing how much better you feel after a nice long walk. &lt;br/&gt;I happeed to have a few cache containers in the car, so I placed them out along the trail. It's a lovely trail I'd never been down before, so hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are nothing particularly special... log book, pen and some swag in tupperware.&lt;br/&gt;This was my favourite spot I saw today... I love the way the fields end and open up into this lovely forested area. The title refers to what I wrote down in my cachebook... &quot;Note to self: Bring diet (name of pop) next time you go caching&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Please enjoy this series and feel free to share your bad week stories with us, if you so desire.</groundspeak:long_description>

After placing many traditional caches, I thought it was time for one of these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is roadside. This road is fairly quiet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final is a regular size cache containing a stamp and inkpad plus logbook and other trading items.&lt;br/&gt;If you're not into letterboxing, you can still find this cache and trade some swag. There is room for small Travel Bugs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please trade up or trade even. The hike to this one isn't far but the bushwack isn't fun, hence terrain level.&lt;br/&gt;Stay safe!</groundspeak:long_description>

Log sheet damp but signable. The stamp and the stamp pad were wet inside their baggie. I still have pink fingers from handling them. Tried to dry it out as best as possible and closed the lid tight, but this type of container will probably leak again. Rehid it and covered it up a little better than found.

Hooper, who was then living in this township, Deacon Alfred Bingham of Glanford, and Rev. Job Moxom, of the Binbrook Church. They held meetings at the residences of brethren, and also in the school house at the Mulligan Settlement, converting many to Christ. In 1854 Elder Hooper, having the interest of his church at heart, succeeded in building a chapel for regular worship on Lot 19, 1st concession, on the farm of William Mulligan, for which he afterwards was paid by the members and friends of church enterprise. A meeting was called on the 13th of June, 1857, for the organization of the society. In July 1st of the same year it became an established church. There were, previous to and at the time of this church organization in this township, the following regular Baptist brethren and sisters: Elder Wm. Hooper, Christina Hooper, Elizabeth Hooper, David Jones, Elizabeth Jones, John Hicks, Harriet Hicks, John Boylan, Ann Elizabeth Creighton, Frederick Ricker, Eleanor Ricker, Catharine Ricker, John Cowie, Isabella Cowie, Mary Hooper, John Peddie (now the Rev. Dr. Peddie) John McConichie, Catherine Mulligan, Margaret Mulligan, Richard Mulligan and Robert Mulligan, all of whom became members of the Second Baptist Church after its reorganization, and with others making a total membership at that time of fifty-seven communicants. Elder Job Moxom was also largely instrumental in the formation of this society. Rev. N. Richards is its present pastor, and the members of the church in good standing now number seventy-seven. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elder William Hooper was born in England, and emigrated to this country in 1838, and to this township in 1839. He resided a short time in hamilton, where he subsequently received his ordination. Mr. Hooper died in the Township of Oneida, County Haldimand, on the 29th March, 1876, in the 74th year of his age, and in the triumph of his faith, beloved by all for his good works. He is buried in the cemetery attached to the church he was instrumental in building. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Peddie, one of the first members of the Second Baptist church, was a native of this township; entered the ministry, and is now a Doctor of Divinity, and has the pastorate of one of the most influential Baptist churches in New York City. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The church and cemetery are located at 330 Baptist Church road, next to the hydro land. This cemetry is under the supervision of the Cemetery Board of Onondaga Baptist Church. It is still active, accepting new burials, and is very well maintained, and currently contains 274 records. The church has not been used since the 1980's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a regular sized lock n lock, located in a camo bag. Please replace the cache in the bag, and then back into its hiding place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be respectful of your surroundings and leave the pen in the cache. :D</groundspeak:long_description>

It offers a great view of the city, a basketball court, a great play park (located 300m the cache, but still worth it to bring the kids) and a wooded area. The cache is located in the wooded area on a hill - it will be slippery when wet but isn't too steep. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck finding the cache, and please let me know if you think the terrain rating needs to be increased. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, please remember to hide as well or better than you found it.

Nothing fancy, just a roadside grab and go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is small but is big enough for smaller trade items, TBs, coins. It DOES have a pencil in it so you'll be ok for writing utensils, until the pencil runs out of lead anyways. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace as found and careful of the tree - it's a little rotten in places..&lt;br/&gt;Good luck...</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Another simple cache along an old, abandoned road. Parking is available at either end of the road, but I recommend parking on Johnson Rd as there is room for 3 or 4 cars to pull off here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small lock n lock container with a log book and swag. Please trade up or trade even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am almost certain we have all been there... we get so involved in the heat of the moment that we do something others would consider crazy/stupid, all in the name of finding a geocache. This cache is a tribute to those moments where we say to ourselves, &quot;well, hindsight is 20/20...&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My best hindsight is 20/20 moment came on a cache in Brantford, about 3 weeks after I purchased my new GPS. It was late spring, and I decided to go out alone to find a geocache that popped up about 3 km from home. That right there probably should have been enough to stop me - I was not confident with my GPS yet, and it was spring, so it was slippery and wet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I loaded the co-ords into my GPS and started on my journey... eventually coming to a stream that needed to be crossed. I had two options... wade across it, as it was only knee-deep, or proceed about 50m upstream and cross on a fallen log. I chose the high snd dry method, as it was quite cool and I didn't feel like getting wet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I started to cross the log when I heard a slight crack, but, focusing on finding the cache, didn't think anything of it. Took another step and CRACK! I fell right through the log... almost. As a female, I have a larger chest than I do stomach, and so I got caught! The log pressed against my chest and back, holding me about a foot above the water (so I was able to stay dry), but in the process I sprained my ankle and knee and broke two ribs, as well as tearing my jacket and shirt, and some cuts and bruises. Overall, not my finest moment... but it gets better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being 100% stuck in the log, I had no choice but to use my PAF to try and get ahold of someone to come resuce me. I was a new cacher and so the only cacher I had in my phone was my sister... who called the fire department. I have NEVER been so embrassed in my whole life... having 6 male firefighters come running down the bank to where I was (fortunately I had my co-ordinates so I was easy to find), and having them cut me out of the tree (while my sister sat on the sidelines and laughed, and laughed, AND LAUGHED!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worst of all... they made me go to Urgent Care and so I DNF`d the cache. BUMMER!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, I have been afraid to go across logs over streams ever since, and now try to go geocaching with a buddy whenever I can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you log your find, please feel free to share your best Hindsight is 20/20 geocaching moment. We, the geocaching community, will try not to laugh too hard at you.</groundspeak:long_description>

In any case, this cache is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As avid geocachers, there are lots of little things we do, that muggles would find strange or downright crazy. This cache is a tribute to all of those little (and not so little) things that make us unique from all the muggles out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have started the list off with 20 things, but think it would be fun if each cacher who finds the cache adds something to the list in their log. You don't have to play, but I'm sure you have lots of ideas out there! Let's see just how long we can make this list!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know you're a geocacher when:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.

Myrtleville House Museum still stands in a spacious lot in Brantford, Ontario, and serves as a memoir of life during this time period.  The traditional farmhome tells the tale of four generations of the Good family and their lives in Brant County as it expanded and grew through the remainder of the 19th and 20th centuries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myrtleville House Museum is operated by the city of Brantford and is open for tours throughout the year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, you don't have to do the tour to find this cache, although it's a great way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon if you're into history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you DO need to do to find this cache: you need to find out some info about Alan Good and his family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Info can be researched online, or you can go to Myrtleville House and do the tour. I don't feel that having to pay to do a tour should be a requirement to find a cache, so I am allowing for internet research to save y'all some $$; us college kids can't afford to spend any more than we already do!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Info you need to determine:&lt;br/&gt;a) The year Myrtleville House was built and furnished. Year = _ _ _ _ (sum should be 19)&lt;br/&gt;b) The year that William Charles Good (Allen's son) formed the United Farmers of Ontario.

While the original was a three stage multi, this is a traditional, regular sized cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On long, cold days, Pasha likes to wander around warm places. This is one of those places she frequents to wander, look around and grab a bite to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a regular sized lock'n'lock container that contains a log book and the usual geoswag. Please trade up or trade even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in a swampy area near the shopping centre, but you don't actually have to go in the swamp to get it. It should be perfectly accessible from dry land. Easiest access is off the Roy Blvd, rather than from the mall parking lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: June 1/2011 - the area has flooded this spring, with all of the rain we have been having, however the cache is dry. You MAY get your feet wet after extremely heavy rains. Will check on it again in a month or so and see what the water level is doing.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Today, I thought that I would go out and place a couple of simple caches for 13coach13's The Hides of March II event, occuring tomorrow. Apparently, it wasn't to be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a small lock n' lock container that contains log book and some tradables. The cache is not designed to be overly difficult or trecherous, however, for me, the difficult part came when it was time to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who don't know me, I drive a VW New Beetle, that I love and adore, but naturally isn't very good in the mud. Enter geocaching placement. I had the BRILLIANT idea to pull up off the road onto a little gravel driveway. PERFECT for one or two cars to pull off the road, so the cachers can find the cache. Right? WRONG!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though my car is not an overly heavy car, in the time it took me to place the cache, take three sets of co-ords and average them out, my car sank about 6 inches into the mud... just enough to get myself EXTREMELY stuck. So, what do I do? I decide to attempt to get myself unstuck by putting pedal to the metal and flooring it. What does this do? Absolutely nothing, except spray the entire front of my white car with mud. Yay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this point, I decide to get out and push it, seeing if my little car could be budged using my (weak) muscles. Nope, nothing. So I tried to put some rocks and random branches under the front tires, hoping to get some grip. Nope, they sank in the mud too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to phone a friend, I guess... until I realize all my geocaching friends are busy, and all my non-geocaching friends would just laugh at me for getting stuck in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily, while I was sitting in my car, a very friendly tow truck driver just happened to be driving by where the cache was placed, and noticed my little predicament. He was able to tow me out and save my littler car. Best of all - he was a geocacher, so understood the whole geocaching thing!! Hopefully he is reading this now and can try for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moral of the story - if it is wet/spring/fall/raining, DO NOT attempt to park on the gravel driveway that looks like it would be a safe place to park off the road, unless you have some good friends with tow lines you can call at a moments' notice. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please don't repeat my mistake. Stay safe!</groundspeak:long_description>

I am always looking for new, fairly level places to walk my new puppy, and happened to stunmble on this little place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a simple thermos-like container with a twist on/off lid. Currently it has a log book and some swag. Trackables and coins will fit if they are smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hike is about 150m from roadside parking. I saw a snake while placing this cache, so those who are leary of snakes should do this one with a buddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun and please trade up or trade even.</groundspeak:long_description>

I always love little, tranquil spots like this, especially since it's so close to the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a park and grab, with a mild incline. Light bushwack may be needed in summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please trade up or trade even. Cache is a small but still big enough for TBs, coins, keychains, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and see you on the trails!</groundspeak:long_description>

If you've stolen, borrowed without asking, or accidentally taken something without telling the person, here's your chance to get forgiveness without getting in trouble. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story behind this cache... well, this cache container magically appeared in my caching bag one day... and as a form of &quot;revenge&quot; I was told not to return it by the person who took it (not that I will mention any names, right D??). Don't worry, it's not one of the missing ones you all are worried about... it was a dummy cache on a &quot;multi&quot; that drove both theif and I NUTS!!!! If the former owner wants it back, (s)he's welcome to replace it with a container of his or her own choosing. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing hard about this cache, as the whole point of this cache is to seek forgiveness from those whom we may have hurt in the past. Should be a quick park and grab, although please make sure you recover the cache to ensure it stays protected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, let the sob stories begin!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No traders here... although there is a pencil in the cache you may want to take a pen in case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy hunting, and remember, please no negativities towards all those who have done wrong in the past!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>if you hated this container in it's original location... well, this spot really isn't much different.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Please BYOP, and possibly some tweezers depending on how small your fingers are. Please make sure the lid is replaced tightly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While out searching for a nearby cache, I looked down from the road and saw a beautiful lake tucked down in here. However, upon closer inspection, there doesn't appear to be a way to get to it without getting wet feet; at least not from this access point. This was the farthest possible point I was willing to travel to in my hiking shoes... but perhaps you will be braver?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITO is always welcome in the area. Parking is roadside or in the small lot across the road. Please think safety first when crossing the street, and be careful of heavy machinery in the area from the nearby storage facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update: 7/11/11 - increasing the difficulty of the cache due to the number of DNFs. Went to check on it, it is there.</groundspeak:long_description>

Pasha88 grabbed the cache and gave it to us, on chef's orders, for our program here at camp. But, we thought it would be a better idea to place it somewhere else, as a new cache for the chef to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pasha88 helped us pick out a spot on the map, then did the leg work for us, so we could place this special cache for an awesome cacher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is the original container that the chef had placed, but we added a few bits of ourselves as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope that you enjoy finding the cache. It shouldn't be too hard, as we asked Pasha88 to keep it &quot;kid friendly&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so we say, this one is for the chef... Galloping Gourmet!</groundspeak:long_description>

I know difficulty 5 seems quite high, but really it's easy if you look it up online and have a basic knowledge of math. Shouldn't take you that long to figure out once you know what you're doing. &lt;br/&gt;The first 4 are all related to one another on each other, the last one is a random fact you'll have to Google.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual cache is a 1.5/1.5. difficulty rating is for the puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 43 aa.bcc&lt;br/&gt;W 080 dd.eee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;aa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phineas and Ferb come by for a cold drink after work, but as they work as phsyicists at the local university, they only speak in Kelvins.

Maybe the reason the Earth is so wierd right now is because there's too much  technetium.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first of my geocaching hides that I have imported to opencaching
The cache is hidden in a school bus and even though many open water divers go through the bus it is still considered an overhead environment so I would recommend you have at a mininum cavern training. This cache while quite awesome is not worth dying over
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


I have submerged a regular size Tupperware container in the front
of an underwater school bus I used the Geocaching rating system
which gave the cache an automatic 5 for terrain and difficulty just
due to the fact that specialized equipment was needed. Assuming
that you can scuba it should be an easy find and the difficulty
would be a 2 at the most

  &lt;br /&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is a regular
Tupperware container 8x 3.5 inches that is filled with water (but
still floats)   You can open the container underwater and
sign an underwater dive slate which I am using as a
log.&lt;br /&gt;


 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the posted GPS
Coordinates enter the water which will put you to the left of the
bus&lt;br /&gt;
Descend to the bottom (about
20 feet) and turn right and the bus will be about 15 feet
away&lt;br /&gt;
It is best to do it this way
as the visibility can be near zero at times although when I hid it
I had at least 10-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trout Lake was a working
quarry from 1928 to 1937 when it flooded   Later turned
into a recreational facility it offers  camping, fishing
swimming and scuba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am embarassed to admit
that I have spent a week of my life  underwater here and the
quarry has sunk a couple of buses, fuselages of a cessna and
Harvard Trainer as well as a few cars and boats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Enter from the front door, keep your head under the steering wheel facing the side of the bus and reach directly forward to your right</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woohoo found it! Following our adventure/paddle weekend in Algonquin, we figured a nice little dive would be a good way to conclude it. I &quot;hired&quot; a buddy off the internets for the dive while t4e remained as shore support. The water was a nice 62F and the visibility was much better than expected, I'd say at least 20 ft at first with nobody else around, that's before we started kicking up all the muck that is. We found the bus immediately and the cache was also located after a brief search. The pencil I brought down worked nicely on the dive slate under water and I signed us in. That slate is gettng really full though! We then continued to explore the rest of the quarry. Only drawback to the whole adventure is that we're now late for the CREW event lol! Pictures to come when we're back home. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A tribute to the girls and boys I work with each morning; Bricker, Royal, Vitro and Rocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every morning for the last few months, I have gotten up before dawn and gone to work at the Paris race track, located at the Paris fairgrounds. Come by between 7 and 9 every morning and you will find many of us dedicated horse owners (or, in my case, the hired help) exercising some of the finest standardbreds in the area. Some, like Royal, have a real drive to win. Others, like Rocket, are just coming back from a long, tough injury. And, there are those who are just pets, like my &quot;little&quot; Bricker and Vitro. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located not too far from the race track, this cache was placed one morning after my chores were completed and Bricker and I decided to go for a wander to get some grass and stretch our legs (it's a tough life living in a safe stall, being fed food every 2 hours, all day every day). Across the street you'll find a small, field area that no one seems to really own, but is used for extra parking during the Paris Fair, Labour Day Weekends. The cache itself is a regular sized tupperware style container and contains a number of horsey items - Sires' Stakes keychain, toy horses and fencing, pins, a bridle charm, horsey bumper sticker, horse pen, etc. As I was trying to handle a horse and place a cache at the same time as I was placing it, it may not be perfect, but it's been averaged a few times for accuracy. Watch out for the horse tracks and come say hi if you notice a white VW beetle in the parking lot across from the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Originally there was one for each gold medal that Canadians won during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, plus a bonus. However, only a few remain active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a quick, roadside park and grab along a stretch of highway 2. Shoulders here are nice and wide and should allow for even transport trucks to pull off safely. Please remember to use your 4-way flashers and be careful if you find yourself crossing the road. Please do not enter private property - there is no need to find the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache has been placed with permission of the nearby business. The owner knows its there. If he sees you, please smile and wave rather than trying to hide what you're doing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small lock'n'lock container, with log book and small trade items. Please bring a writing stick as there isn't one in the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks and happy caching!!   </groundspeak:long_description>

The coach has hidden a few as well, making her one of my geo-heroes of Brantford. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you know the coach, you'll know she pretty much eats, sleeps and breathes geocaching... she was the organizer of Brantford's first ever event cache (along with Greenthumb9, talonnfenton and myself) and continues to come up with ingenious caches for her fellow geocachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyways, I have wanted to place one specifically for the coach since that event and am just getting around to it now. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the cache: small, round and should be a fairly quick grab and go. Parking is roadside. Please stay back from the nearby railroad tracks, there is absolutely no reason to approach them from any angle. You should be able to stay back 30 feet or so from the lights/crossing signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tall grass may contain critters, so careful at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Big Bang Thoery has many meanings, including the popular TV show of the same name. This is the third in a series of 10 caches created in a tribute to the Big Bang Theory and the hilariosity the show brings to TV, in particular, Sheldon Cooper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists working at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California. They are colleagues, best friends and roommates, although in all capacities their relationship is always tested primarily by Sheldon's regimented and non-conventional ways. They are also friends with their Cal Tech colleagues, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The foursome spend their time working on their individual work projects, playing video games, watching science fiction movies or reading comic books. As they are self-professed nerds, all have little or no luck with &quot;popular&quot; women. When Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring actress originally from Omaha, moves into the apartment next to Leonard and Sheldon's, Leonard has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his girlfriend.&lt;br/&gt;Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, is the nerdiest of them all; the king of the comic book geeks, the smartest of the group, and, of course, the character with some of the most hilarious one-liners known to the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my head, I see the nerds of Big Bang Theory enjoying geocaching due to the technological aspect of using government-placed, multi-billion dollar sattelites to find tupperware in the woods. Maybe it's just me though, as nerds typically don't like the outdoors, but I can dream, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyways, in this very memorable opening, the boys are in a VERY heated video game (World of Warcraft, for those who care)battle, fighting for the Sword of Azeroth. The boys played for 97 hours as a team until they arrived at the Gates of Elzebub. There, they battled a host of armed goblins protecting the sword, but instead of helping, Sheldon grabbed the Sword, teleported out of the dungeon, and sold the Sword on eBay. However, as you will see, another member of the squard buys it... and becomes the SWORD MASTER!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reference as it appears in the show is available here: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJoJn5M2Ov8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache should be a fairly simple find. Easy parking is roadside just a few metres from the cache. Careful as the &quot;concealment&quot; is rotting away quite nicely and will break if you apply too much pressure.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In order to solve this puzzle, you are going to have to use your deductive reasoning and logical thinking skills in order to sort out who Lucy's ideal man is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read the story below. In it, you will find clues to help you figure out which guy Lucy is likely to date. Once you decide who YOU think Lucy should date, find the associated co-ordinates (at the bottom of this listing) and go out to find the cache. There are four sets of co-ords below, one for each possible mate. Make sure you read the story carefully to be sure you get all the clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ideal Man&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy strutted up the street, passing a stranger who resembled Frankenstein carrying a six-pack of lager. She presumed they were headed for the same place ‚Äì who else would wear a costume in the middle of February. The dull thuds of distant music lead them both up the stone path to a small cottage. Sally opened the door, still sober enough to remember to greet her guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúLucy! Great! Now we can really get this party started!‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy was impressed with Sally‚Äôs outfit ‚Äì fake black and white Dalmatian fur and a matching black and white chapeau and wig for a great Cruella De Ville. Looking down, she wished she had made more of an effort with her own costume. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúWho are you supposed to be, then?‚Äù Sally asked Lucy, taking her coat and scrutinizing her brown dress. ‚ÄúGive me a hint.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frankenstein squeezed passed them, groaning. Lucy frowned.&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs not my fault if I can‚Äôt guess it!‚Äù Sally led her friend inside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy frowned again, shifting her frown slightly to the right. Sally was confused. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThe Mona Lisa!‚Äù Lucy exclaimed. ‚ÄúYou know, with that glum face?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs more of a smirk,‚Äù Sally pouted, ‚Äúand anyways, that skirt is WAY too short to be anything that Mona would have worn.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúOk, ok‚Ä¶‚Äù Lucy conceded, ‚ÄúI should have worn a better costume. I don‚Äôt know, Sal, you throw a party and give me a chance to meet some cute guys and I can‚Äôt even really tell what they look like! They‚Äôre all aliens and cowboys and kings.‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThat Frankenstein seemed to like you‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúNo way. He‚Äôs not my type.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sally and Lucy walked past a couple of mermaids and into the kitchen, pulling a bottle of wine out of the fridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúBefore you start whining about how you‚Äôre never going to meet the right guy, there‚Äôs something I should tell you,‚Äù whispered Sally, spotting a police officer in the hallway. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say I never do anything for you‚Ä¶ there are four bachelors here tonight!‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy wasn‚Äôt overly optimistic. &quot;But Sal, you know the only type of many I will go for is one who‚Äôs tall with big brown eyes, and rich!‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúYou forgot handsome,‚Äù Sally grinned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúNo, that goes without saying.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sally led Lucy by the hand towards the living room and the deep, pulsating music. ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù she trilled. ‚ÄúSadly, only one of the four guys is rich, and only two have brown eyes. But, three of the men are tall. Each man meets at least one of your criteria, and, of course, there is one man who is your ideal man ‚Äì big brown eyes, tall and rich! You won‚Äôt be disappointed.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúGreat party, Sally!‚Äù Captain Kirk gave a cheerful wave.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúHim?‚Äù Lucy immediately perked up. This was looking interesting. She realised her guess was wrong when Catwoman appeared and gave the man a kiss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúCome and try the dip,‚Äù smiled Sally. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs salsa, too.‚Äù Sally was making strange twitching movements with her head. Lucy realised this was some sort of signalling technique and scuttled to her side.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Sally pointed to the far corner. ‚ÄúSingle man number one ‚Äì Michael.‚Äù Then, she pointed over to the drinks table. ‚Äú Those two are Paul and Simon‚Ä¶‚Äù Sally nodded at a man chatting with some friends. ‚ÄúAnd last but not least, we have John.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy smiled. ‚ÄúNot bad going, Sally! I can see that three of them are tall and two have big brown eyes. I‚Äôd call this an impressive start.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúOf course. We aim to please.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúSo who‚Äôs who? Which one‚Äôs got all three?‚Äù Lucy glanced across at the four men. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sally smiled, teasing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for me to know and for you to find out.‚Äù Grinning, she wandered off to chat with some other guests, glancing back to see who Lucy aimed for first. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúPsst! You could at least introduce me!‚Äù Lucy exclaimed, grabbing her friend‚Äôs arm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúHello, are you a friend of Sally‚Äôs?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy spun around and saw Michael behind her, drink in hand. She smiled. Not a bad start to the evening. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúYes, and you?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Michael sipped his beer, froth clinging to his upper lip. ‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy did her frown, Michael didn‚Äôt understand. Lucy tried a lighter smirk. ‚ÄúThink art. Think Italy. Think Da Vinci.‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael looked her up and down, looking vague. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThe Mona Lisa!!‚Äù she exclaimed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúOh, right.‚Äù The man was obviously not impressed. ‚ÄúI meant, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy told him, and watched him wander off. What was so original about his costume anyways?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She turned around to find Paul at her side. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lucy, and before you ask, I‚Äôve come as the Mona Lisa, not as myself or as my look-alike cousin Val.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm Paul‚Ä¶‚Äù said the handsome young man. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm supposed to be‚Ä¶‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy drained her glass and nodded. ‚ÄúI can tell. Very nice.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul dutifully headed for the drinks table and brought back a bottle of wine, quickly refilling Lucy‚Äôs glass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was starting to enjoy herself. This was rather fun. Both he and Michael had the same colour eyes, and he had a lovely smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back in a minute,‚Äù Lucy raised her voice over the music, shouting up to Paul‚Äôs ear. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go away!‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;She rushed off to the washroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When she got back downstairs, Lucy found Paul standing with Simon, enjoying a man-talk about the hockey score. She smiled. They were quite different in appearance, but as they stood beside one another, Lucy noticed they were almost exactly the same height. This was getting interesting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs Mona Lisa!‚Äù Simon grinned. Lucy was impressed; Simon was intelligent as well. ‚ÄúPaul told me,‚Äù the man admitted. ‚ÄúBut, that‚Äôs a lovely dress.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Lucy‚Äôs eyes flitted between Paul and Simon enjoying the flirtation. She looked around for Sally, but her friend was nowhere to be seen. She smiled across at John, who gave a little wave. She noticed that he and Simon were not built of the same stature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Lucy,‚Äù She shook hands with the last man. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard a lot about you.‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúReally?‚Äù John seemed surprised. ‚ÄúI like your outfit, very smart.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy was having fun. She had to go and tell Sally. She found her friend in the kitchen, refilling the punchbowl. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a bit like Tom Cruise in ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äù, he‚Äôs perfect!‚Äù Lucy gushed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúOnly he‚Äôs not tall?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúWho isn‚Äôt tall?‚Äù Lucy asked, confused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúTom Cruise,‚Äù Sally replied. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only like five foot something.‚Äù &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‚ÄúWell, then he takes second place,‚Äù Lucy smiled, ‚Äúbecause I have already found my number one.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucy headed back into the party, drink in hand. She smiled; she‚Äôd found her ideal man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who was tall and rich with big brown eyes? Who was Lucy‚Äôs Ideal Man?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Lucy‚Äôs ideal man is Michael, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 14.338 W 080 16.934&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Lucy‚Äôs ideal man is Paul, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 13.332 W 080 15.308&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Lucy‚Äôs ideal man is Simon, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 15.476 W 080 15.474&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Lucy‚Äôs ideal man is John, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 14.329 W 080 15.468&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a regular sized lock'n'lock container with swag. There is a pen in the cache, but I would suggest bringing your own just in case. Please remember to cover the cache as well or better than you found it so it doesn't get muggled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have any questions, please email me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Placing a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is designed to be an easy roadside grab, although if you drive anything bigger than a smart car (or VW Beetle) I would suggest parking across the road at the local diner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache isn't big enough for a pen, so please bring your own, and remember to place it back where you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In order to solve this puzzle, you are going to have to help the Sherrif decide Whodunit in the case of a dead woman in small town rural Ontario. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read the story below and decide who you think is guilty. Once you know Whodunit, look at the co-ords below the story, then go out and find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're going to have to use your logical thinking skills to solve this one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a regular sized lock'n'lock container, well hidden. There is some swag in the cache (typical dollar store) so feel free to trade, just please trade up or trade even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dying for Snow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every fortnight when you make your mail flight up to Pickle Lake, you look forward to visiting old Hildie. All the folks up at the lake are fine by you, but when you deliver Hildie's mail, you're not just doing your job - you're exercising a genuine pleasure. Hildie keeps a moonshine still, way back in the pine trees of her 50-acre spread. This trip, though, Hildie was so overwrought she forgot her manners and pounced on the mail packet without offering you a drink. She found the envelope from the photo lab in Kenora and ripped it open, saying, &quot;Now those guys'll have to believe me.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A glance at the photograph showed Hildie was telling the truth two weeks ago when she handed you the film. As she had predicted, the picture showed a body lying in the snow, beyond the chain-link fence that the gold mine had erected around its mining site. Hildie was right about something else, too. This was a genuine mystery. The woman was lying between two great pines in the middle of an expanse of fresh snow. There were no tracks leading to her body, except the pockmarks of a large dog and the holes made by snow falling from the branches above. There was no snow on the woman, not even a dusting, so the only way she could have got there was if she had fallen from the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet this wasn't as far-fetched as it might sound. The arrival of the gold miners had also brought eco-warriors up from the south. The activists were intent on scaling the trees around the mines and this woman was likely one of them, a protester who had fallen from her perch. If that cleared up half the mystery, it didn't explain the rest of Hildie's story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hildie is in her 70s and had a bad limp. Rather than scrape through a gap in the chain-link fence to get to the body, she went home to radio for help. Unfortunately, she was out of methanol and her generator was dry, so the radio wouldn't work. You told her she should have filled the generator with moonshine, and she said she wished she had thought of that - the woman might still be alive. Instead, she locked up her dog, Betsy, and drove to the sheriff's office in Pickle Lake, taking the photo on the way. By the time the sheriff and Hildie returned to the site, the body was gone and a fresh fall of snow left no traces as to how she might have disappeared. With no body, there was no mystery. As the sheriff said at the time, no one knew how but the woman hadn't simply got up and wandered away? You had seen Hildie's photographs, you knew this was impossible. Dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, the woman would have died of hypothermia in half an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hildie asked, &quot;Do you recognise her?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't say you did, but these eco-warriors prefer to travel by sea rather than take your mail flight up from Kenora. The boys who came with you were Hildie's sworn enemies: lumberjacks. On this trip, you had flown out 10 big guys; no doubt hired to cut the eco-warriors out of the trees and maybe throw a scare into them. You apologised to Hildie for this, but she knows you don't get to pick and choose my passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hildie had lived the simple life in Pickle Lake for more than 40 years and she had no intention of selling up. She was even doing her bit for the protesters, allowing them to set up a base camp on her land. When you saw their camp on your last trip, you thought, that makes sense of the letters Hildie had been receiving from Toronto over the past year. She and the eco-warriors may have been in cahoots but Hildie was in a minority of one around the Lake. Everyone else would have welcomed an offer from the gold company - but only Hildie owned land in the right vicinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you left Hildie, you recognised one of the protesters, a youngster named Josh Abbot. You still felt guilty for flying up the lumberjacks, so you said hello and warned him the compound fence had been strengthened. It wouldn't be so easy for him to break in and scale the trees. In Hildie's photograph, the fence had been in poor shape, with holes cut out and a few strands of colourful nylon thread snagged on the wire where a protester must have snuck through. Josh thanked you for the information but told you that he and his partner planned to make rope walkways so they could flit from tree to tree. You wished him good luck, and worried that you might see another body on the ground before springtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you were talking, Betsy bounded up and jumped all over Josh. He had clearly made a firm friend. Josh laughed, telling you that he had no idea what kind of reception he would get up in Pickle Lake, but Betsy had made the trip worthwhile. As Hildie always said, Betsy was the smartest dog in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the sheriff saw Hildie's picture, he wasted no time calling in Frank Tanner, the watchman for the gold company. It wasn't the sheriff's style to move fast, but what you didn't know until you inveigled your way into his office was that he already had a body. The dead woman had been found in a ravine on the far side of the Lake, about 30 miles from the mining site, which was no distance in such a spread-out community. There was no doubt that this was the woman in Hildie's photograph: she was wearing the same dark jeans and sweats. The sheriff showed Tanner the picture and told him, &quot;This has to be embarrassing, Frank - a dead woman on your shift.&quot; Tanner claimed he didn't know a thing but the sheriff threw a curve-ball and said he'd found Frank's tire tracks around the ravine. There had been more than two feet of snow since the photo was taken, but Tanner was none too bright, and soon admitted to dumping the body. But he swore he had not killed her. Like the sheriff said, he was just saving himself and the gold company the grief of a dead eco-warrior on the site. Later, you asked the sheriff if he believed Tanner's story. The sheriff shrugged, but said once he got the forensic report, he would call the witnesses together and figure out the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things move slowly in Pickle Lake. You flew the woman's body down to Kenora for the autopsy and you were back by the time the sheriff got the results. Tanner was still in the sheriff's cell but the forensic report went some way to supporting his story: the woman had died of hypothermia, not trauma. She was about 40 years old and part native. The local native tribe claimed no one from their tribe was missing. You figured, if none of them knew the dead woman, maybe she was the illegitimate daughter of one of the old boys. The sheriff thought that sounded right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sheriff had four possible witnesses. Frank Tanner, of course. Josh Abbot and the other eco-warrior, his girlfriend, Flossie Jones. And finally, old Hildie. You were there, too, and you had to admire the professional set-up. The sheriff had wired up a projector so that you all sat in the half-light, looking at Hildie's photograph blown up on the office wall. Now you saw the photograph so big, you wondered about the faint swirling pattern in the snow, leading away from the woman's body. Hildie was more excited by the tail end of a rope, visible in one of the trees. Flossie and Josh had claimed they had made a start scaling a tree before the weather drove them back to camp. When Hildie said she had seen Frank Tanner cutting down the ropes the next day, he had called her a liar. The photograph clearly showed that Tanner was the liar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Josh asked the sheriff if the woman showed signs of having fallen from a height. The sheriff said there was nothing conclusive: she had cuts and bruises but no broken bones. Hildie pointed out that the snow was deep enough to have cushioned a fall. Flossie wondered if the dead woman could have got her injuries falling through the brambles into the ravine where she had been found. The sheriff asked how she knew about the brambles, but the girl refused to be trapped: she'd gone along to look at the crime scene after the news came out. The sheriff seemed to accept this. At any rate, he told us that the postmortem proved the woman was alive when she got her cuts and grazes and dead before she entered the ravine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What else could he tell us? The dead woman had come up from Thunder Bay on the train. Josh and Flossie were adamant they had never seen her before, but the sheriff said she fitted the eco-warrior profile: she had arrests for drinking, drug posession and tresspassing. This time, he got a reaction ... from Hildie. She told the sheriff he ought to be ashamed of himself, casting aspersions on two good kids. Hildie so identified with the eco-warriors, she had taken to dressing like them, though her jacket was a lurid, tatty ski jacket rather than the mountaineering jackets the kids could afford. Once the sheriff had calmed everyone down, he admitted that the crew of the train reported that the dead woman sounded more like a prospector than a protester: prowling the cars regardless of the time of day, wrapped in an old pink shawl as she bragged about a fortune waiting for her in Pickle Lake. The crewmen wrote her off as a fantasist, a damaged woman who was getting on in life and getting desperate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You said, &quot;However she died, she must have been drunk, stumbling around in the snow or falling out of trees.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I don't know if she was drunk,&quot; the sheriff replied. &quot;I can tell you she was blind. And that's the problem. I think we've got a murder inquiry on our hands.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You nodded sadly. &quot;I think so too, sheriff.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So Whodunnit? Think you know?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were 4 suspects: Frank Tanner, Josh Abbot, Flossie Jones or old Hildie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Frank Tanner is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 43 15.496 W 080 15.469&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Josh Abbot is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 43 15.388 W 080 14.681&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think Flossie Jones is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 15.017 W 080 12.793&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think that Hildie is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 43 17.976 W 080 16.791&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2WVHR - GC2WVHR Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A regular sized container in Santa Maria park in Cambridge, Ontario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who don't know, the Santa Maria was one of Columbus' ships during the late 1400's. This park, located in the south-eastern part of the city shares its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park itself boasts a lovely forested area, spray pad, swings and jungle gym. We chose to place this cache in the forested areas. Please be kind to the area and practice CITO and STAY ON THE TRAILS as much as possible - it is possible to get within a couple metres of this cache while still following one of the main trails through the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a square take out container. It may or may not have the name of another cache on the outside/log book cover - please ignore this as I do recycle caches and logs when possible..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Area gets slippery in the muddy season. May not be winter friendly, as is on ground level, but is waterproof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Path entrance, the one you will want to use, has been added as a waypoint. DO NOT use the path that goes across the back of peoples' yards. You won't be able to get to the cache from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is now located nowhere near the &quot;neighbour's dumping place&quot;, and is not deep within the trees. It is located in a root base, under a small rock. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are still having problems with it, please let me know, but hopefully no more DNFs to be logged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;GZ1Z9R0 - Path Entrance&lt;br/&gt;N 43¬∞ 20.868 W 080¬∞ 16.995</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache area isn't where I'd expect it to be.   We had a look around in the dark.  Cold, dark winter's night doesn't make for a long search.  The hint came in handy.

The area is lovely, even with the rain.  The path is awesome.  There is even a 10-15' waterfall near the tunnel.  I don't think you can ask for a nicer suburban location for a geocache.  I wish I had of found this spot!  I'll be adding this one to my recommended bookmark list.  There are a number of nice caches near here making this a good day of caching. 

The rain added some water to the creek.  The creek isn't too deep but there was more water at the GZ today than I suspect there was when the cache was placed. This cache got a bit more exciting for me on the way out.  My GPS got caught and was ripped off the lanyard.   The GPSr fell in the water, luckily it didn't fall in the creek proper otherwise it would be halfway to Paris by now. 

I grabbed a couple of pictures for my 400th.   

Thanks for the cache.  I really liked this one. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Night cache along a trail system near the village of Blair (part of&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge) with a total hiking distance of about 7 km.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;The Blair Witch is Back!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right! The infamous Blair witch has found a new home&lt;br /&gt;in a wooded area near her home village of Blair (now part of&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge), just off Blair Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear and terror is already spreading among the peaceful people&lt;br /&gt;living close by! Unfortunately there is no-one among the local&lt;br /&gt;population brave enough to face the horrors of fighting against the&lt;br /&gt;witch, so there is only one person left to do the job:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YOU!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hunt the Blair Witch!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Darkness. More specifically: Night. The darker it is, the&lt;br /&gt;better. Clouds will help you, full moon will not. You can&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; do this cache during the day, and you also cannot do it&lt;br /&gt;in the fog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;From that follows: A flashlight. And a proper one. A cell phone&lt;br /&gt;light or a 1-LED-keychain-light will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; do the job. Make&lt;br /&gt;sure you got full batteries too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The following table. The witch has left traces of her evil&lt;br /&gt;doings in the area she now calls home. The local villagers have&lt;br /&gt;collected those pieces of information over time and compiled them&lt;br /&gt;into a list. You will need this list on your hunt, so take it with&lt;br /&gt;you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.429 W 080¬∞ 22.525&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.435 W 080¬∞ 22.445&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.348 W 080¬∞ 22.521&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.296 W 080¬∞ 22.632&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.192 W 080¬∞ 22.504&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.432 W 080¬∞ 22.279&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.801 W 080¬∞ 22.486&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.748 W 080¬∞ 22.248&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.361 W 080¬∞ 22.248&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.754 W 080¬∞ 22.200&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.488 W 080¬∞ 22.138&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.691 W 080¬∞ 22.310&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.384 W 080¬∞ 22.655&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.471 W 080¬∞ 21.846&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.409 W 080¬∞ 22.209&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.187 W 080¬∞ 21.837&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.263 W 080¬∞ 22.491&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.262 W 080¬∞ 22.029&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.179 W 080¬∞ 21.853&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.379 W 080¬∞ 22.076&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.737 W 080¬∞ 22.230&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.714 W 080¬∞ 22.353&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.590 W 080¬∞ 22.301&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;X&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.656 W 080¬∞ 22.482&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.315 W 080¬∞ 22.282&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Z&lt;br /&gt;N 43¬∞ 22.613 W 080¬∞ 22.398&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Where to Start&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the header coordinates. They point to the entrance to the&lt;br /&gt;trail system you're about to explore. Limited parking is available&lt;br /&gt;across the road, with room for about 2 cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you arrived at the coordinates, take your flashlight and&lt;br /&gt;look around you. From where you're standing, you will be able to&lt;br /&gt;find a set of reflectors in the distance. This first set here will&lt;br /&gt;be close to where you are and should be easy to find, but that&lt;br /&gt;doesn't necessarily hold true for your onwards journey! Go to the&lt;br /&gt;reflectors and look at them closely, they will tell you where you&lt;br /&gt;need to go next...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of trails in this area and all stages can be&lt;br /&gt;reached by following the trails. However, not all stages are&lt;br /&gt;directly &lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt; the trails, some of them require some&lt;br /&gt;bushwhacking away from the trail to get to them. With some of them&lt;br /&gt;there is even a chance that you get your feet wet if you're not&lt;br /&gt;careful where you step, so you're definitely encouraged to stay on&lt;br /&gt;the trails for as long as possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not jump any fences! You also do not need to cross any&lt;br /&gt;roads!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will know when you have reached your destination. Once&lt;br /&gt;you've found the Blair witch's hideout, it's going to be obvious&lt;br /&gt;where her treasure is hidden. It's a winter-friendly hiding&lt;br /&gt;location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total hiking distance when following the trails in an optimal&lt;br /&gt;way is a little over 7 kilometers. Expect to spend about two hours&lt;br /&gt;or more in here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache contains the geocache essentials (logbook, pencils,&lt;br /&gt;sharper - do not remove those items!) and some trading items.&lt;br /&gt;There's plenty of room for swag and trackables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember: If you trade, trade equal or up! Also please stick&lt;br /&gt;to the halloween/witch theme if possible!&lt;/b&gt; Trackable items are&lt;br /&gt;always welcome, regardless of theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not leave spoilers in your logs, especially not&lt;br /&gt;about how many stages there are!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Have fun and good luck!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a few other caches in this area, which you may or&lt;br /&gt;may not want to get while you're out doing this one... ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Extra eyes were very helpful for this cache. We didn't use a straight-forward approach, but it paid off for us. We were able to find the cache in about 1.5 hours (with a few pit stops for the other caches in the area). Great set up for the cache, we really enjoyed it.  </groundspeak:text>

I'm sure the rain was keeping a few people away.  I spotted the container from the Trail as did Bakers Dozen.  The rain was giving O-ironman's GPSr a bit of a challenge.  We got him to the right area and he found it also.  He even scrambled up and grabbed the container. 

We all shared the FTF.

Pack up what I thought I would need for a complete day of geocaching as my plan was to get as much done while the sun was up.  Put my bike, kayak, rope, step ladder, rubber boots, hiking stick, lots of water, and other tools that would be needed for this adventure of caching.  My ever faithful geodog Champ also accompanied me, as caching can't be the same without him as he seems to have a very keen geosense.... of course he is a border collie.  Great day to cache before the temperature dips and the snow starts flying.  Know this area well so didn't find it too difficult but still enjoyed the challenge.  Great hide, well worth the adventure.  TFTH</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the starting point of the third annual Great Lord Simcoe
24 Hour Geocaching Marathon. &lt;br /&gt;
This carpool lot is the starting point for over a dozen geocachers
that went geocaching in the Kitchener-Waterloo area for 24 hours
straight, on August 12 2006.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cachers were being treated to the following this year: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full moon, which makes for easier night caching - One meteor
shower, so you can walk off the trail because you were looking at
the sky, not your GPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three vehicles to choose from! The &quot;Red Jeep&quot;, the &quot;Short Bus&quot;
and the &quot;Mobile Photo Hut&quot; -- all co-ordinated on Amateur Radio
using simplex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous antics during the silly hour at 3AM.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This year, the GLS Marathon included these noble cachers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keith Watson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jimminie Crickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northernpenguin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chris-mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HomerJFong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fizbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carrgirl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geek-e&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MsKardiac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCCooperAgency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dreadnaught&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff-Trex&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 ( more updates to come )&lt;br /&gt;
The cache container is classified as a micro, as it is too small to
accomodate a pencil (bring your own!) or trade items. Geocoins will
probably fit though, and it is on the larger end of the micro
size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I was in Woodstock tonight and this this one on the way down.

I had looked for this one before in the summer and could not find it. It is amazing what a difference some footprints in the snow and lack of foliage make. It looks like northernpenguin stopped after I did and replaced the cache.

Had to resort to the hint to find this tricky hide, but luckily the hint really helped and found it.

Left a newly created signature item which I see has already been picked up. [:)]

Congrats to all of the 24 crew for their achievement.

general target area. &lt;br /&gt; About the CC series: CC stands for Couch
Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains
instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those
yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time
you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are
relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will
always directly give you the required cache
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;

When I realized that the D/T combo was the last one needed to complete my Fizzy matrix...I was going if I had to swim. Besides....I knew this lake well from waterskiing here years ago, and knew the lake wasn't very deep. So....out comes my cheap Canadian Tire inflatable boat, and with a couple real paddles borrowed from Micd to replace the plastic ones that came with the boat...geob.o.b. &amp; I set out on the lake as the sun set. We had no luck keeping up with Micd &amp; F&amp;J, but managed to get to the shore of the island without any issues. After hunting down the &quot;Puslinch Lake&quot; cache, we decided that bushwacking to this one would be quicker than paddling the inflatable around the island. I'm not sure now that was the case, as the it was very slow going in spots. Once at GZ we quickly figured where the cache was, and though it was a bit of a reach, we were pleased to see it wasn't 25 feet up like so many other caches today. By the time we bushwacked back to our boat...it was totally dark out now...but the paddle back in darkness was a satisfying one...

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After arriving at the parking co-ords and Crystal realizing she went to school with the ski school owner, we set off to what we expected to be a quick grab after a short paddle. Well the paddle was short but the find not so much. We searched for the better part of an hour before resorting to the Blackberry. Emailed the owner in hopes of a hint. Crystal mistyped and said there was 33 of us on the island instead of three.  I would have loved to see his face when he opened the email. Got no reply from the owner or the PAF we used, so off we went tot the next cache on the island. After hearing from Lisdowney we returned to GZ. It took a little more searching to locate and the cache was retrieved shortly after. Thanks for the help Arnie and Gerry.
Thanks for putting this cache out here. The co-ords are bang on and the terrain rating is well deserved.</groundspeak:text>

fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.

1st of 1

Hmmm  Looks like a geocache, feels like a geocache, had trouble finding it like a geocache...  this is my first opencache find

I was here yesterday and had my first opencache DNF. Today I was not really planning on doing this but came back to map the trail for Northern Penguins Ontario Trail Project.   Once I finished I came back for another try and still could not find it so as I was heading out of bush admitting defeat for the second time I stumbled upon it

Thanks for the FTF prize.  Not often you can claim an FTF after 14 weeks

It's a traditional hide and should be an easy find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have won this container including the contents at GC2A10A as a prize for completing their specially set up multi-cache in the shortest time. It seems logical that it took us the longest time to actually put the container out. :-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;b&gt;FTF prize&lt;/b&gt; for this cache is something slightly different: Whoever finds the cache first gets to pick a name for it. Just include your choice in your FTF log and the listing shall be updated accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area around the cache site can get &lt;b&gt;slightly swampy&lt;/b&gt;, so if conditions are wet, make sure you bring good boots for the last few meters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is on the ground but in an easily visible and fairly obvious hiding spot and so may still be findable in winter. However you may run into problems under &lt;b&gt;heavy snow cover&lt;/b&gt; (more than a meter or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bugspray&lt;/b&gt; needed in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park is &lt;b&gt;closed at night&lt;/b&gt; between 23:00 and 06:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a pencil in the cache, but it hasn't been sharpened yet, so please either &lt;b&gt;bring your own pen&lt;/b&gt; or bring a sharpener.

Started in a small park that looked promising buit ended up bushwhacking for a bit. The area was a bit swampy will be easy in a few days when everything freezes solid. Nice easy find once we reached gz.

prepared to answer a few questions about geocaching if they check

She was joined shortly by HikerT and Dr. House who snuck up on her and banged on the window. It was after midnight by this time and I could hear them all talking as I was returning to the truck.Another car pulled up and shined its high beams on me. thinking it was another BFL member I proceeded to put my flashlight on high beam and return fire. Well, when I got back the OPP officer in the car wasn't too impressed. He simply asked what I was doing in a very abrupt manner then left. That'll teach him for high beaming someone.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is NOT at the posted coordinates, those are just suggested
parking coordinates. &lt;br /&gt; About the CC series: CC stands for Couch
Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains
instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those
yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time
you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are
relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will
always directly give you the required cache
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Paula, Sue and Daisy are mathematical geniuses. They can do any
number of calculations in their head instantly. One day, they're
given the task of figuring out two numbers. Those two numbers are
in the range between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and they're whole
numbers (no decimal numbers). Both numbers can be the same
too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paula is told the &lt;b&gt;product&lt;/b&gt; of both numbers (one number
multiplied with the other), Sue is told the &lt;b&gt;sum&lt;/b&gt; of both
numbers and Daisy is told the &lt;b&gt;difference&lt;/b&gt; between the two
numbers (one number substracted from the other). However, they're
not allowed to tell those numbers to each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, the following conversation ensues:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; I don't know the two numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sue:&lt;/b&gt; You don't need to tell me that, I've known that
already.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, in that case, I know the numbers now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sue:&lt;/b&gt; Ok, I know the numbers now too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daisy:&lt;/b&gt; I still don't know the numbers. I can guess one
number, which is likely to be one of the two numbers, but I don't
know for sure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; I know which number you're thinking of, but this one
is wrong. It's not one of the two numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daisy:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, then I know the numbers now too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that's it! :-D&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Believe it or not, it's actually possible to figure out the two
numbers. There's several different approaches to solving this, so I
cannot give any hints, as one way may be easier for some people but
harder for others, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Write the two numbers as 4 digits (add leading zeroes if necessary)
and call the smaller one ABCD and the larger one EFGH. (Example: if
the smaller number was 345, A would be 0, B would be 3, C would be
4 and D would be 5.)&lt;br /&gt;
N = G*G*G + B*D + C*E*F + (C+A)*G + G&lt;br /&gt;
W = C*C*D*H + (B+D)*(E+G) + D - H&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is at: N 43¬∞ 28.N' W 80¬∞ 32.W'&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is NOT at the posted coordinates, those are just suggested
parking coordinates. &lt;br /&gt; About the CC series: CC stands for Couch
Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains
instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those
yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time
you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are
relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will
always directly give you the required cache
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Ever dreamt of winning the lottery? Well, here's your chance!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You have just invented a device which allows you to retrieve pieces
of information from the future. Howver, it is still a beta version,
so you can only use it to get information about a week ahead of
time, and only a few small bits of information per week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since you always wanted to be rich, you instruct the device to get
you the lottery numbers for the next drawing of the 6/49 lottery.
Unfortunately 6 numbers at the same time is too much information
for the machine, and it just spits out an error.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being a smart cookie, you try and ask the device for the &lt;b&gt;sum&lt;/b&gt;
of the 6 lottery numbers. The machine starts rattling, and voila -
spits out a piece of paper with a number on it. Looking at the
number, you start to realize your mistake: There's got to be
thousands of possible number combinations that yield this
particular sum!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luckily the machine is also quite smart and feels your despair. It
starts working again and spits out some more information: It tells
you that if you figure out exactly how many possible number
combinations there are (from 6 out of 49 numbers) to yield this
particular sum, and then multiply this number with the sum on the
paper, it will yield a new number of around one million, and you
will also get the same number if you multiply all 6 lottery numbers
with each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After that, the machine went silent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now you need to figure out those 6 numbers! Rest assured that this
is enough information to find a single set of 6 winning numbers for
the lottery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to find the cache: Take the 6 numbers you got and call them A,
B, C, D, E and F, in ascending order (that is, the smallest number
will be A, and so on). Now some simple maths:&lt;br /&gt;
N = (C * F) + B&lt;br /&gt;
W = (D * F) - (A * B) + 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is at: N 43¬∞ 28.N' W 80¬∞ 32.W'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can check your answer on the Geochecker: http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=1f7412188dda74babf59c16f34d59c20&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433152353042&amp;name=57696e20746865204c6f747465727921202d204343202331&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please re-hide the cache carefully the same way as you found it. At
times the area is highly muggled, so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Emzernask, Geob.o.b. and myself had figured this one out some time ago...but didn't know about the change of location and hence the puzzle. We spent some time searching the wrong area without success...and with the construction going on feared the worst A couple visits back to the vehicle to double check coords, consult a PAF...and still had no luck.  By now it was dark out...and we decided to try another PAF...where we got a bit more info that narrowed down our search area. It was still frustrating because the info could be interpreted different ways depending on the approach. After a good hour of looking we finally discovered the elusive cache.....
A very satisfying find.....
Thanks to Chrismouse and Northernpenguin for the help...
and to the cache owner for the challenge...

A brand new Multi that will start with easy access followed by a short hike into the woods. You can either leave from here or take your car to the trail head. The round trip is a little under 2 KM. The trails are there but not wide and well groomed. You will need to have good footwear and it is likely wet in the spring and late fall. I am sure the mosquito's will be brutal in the spring and summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to use your stealth skills for Stage 1 and I don‚Äôt recommend trying stage 1 during school rush hours. 9AM and 3PM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a MUST MARK your parking and trail heads. It is very easy to get turned around in here. I thought I had the coords wrong when I entered recently because it was taking me a way I didn't remember. Also the trees are blocking good satellite pick up so you may need to keep a PAF number handy. The hike near the final is guarded by thorn bushes and will probably be better in the winter. So put on your GPS thinking hats and let me know how I did. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The quest offers four challenges to those that seek MuggleScript,
the ancient parchment. It remains here, undisturbed in these woods,
as the developments of your modern world encroach upon this Olde
Forest. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is said that by visiting this place and inscribing your names
upon the parchment, that you will become immune to the gazes of
muggles. While you would be wise to leave this script to rest in
the darkness, there is a way to visit this place. Follow the Olde
Forest Road, and confront 3 challenges along the way, each
requiring a unique solution. Be warned: This is a long and perilous
journey that will take you into the wilds of the Forest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Gatekeeper's Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You must first seek out the Gatekeeper of the Olde Forest Road.
From the posted coordinates, seek out the gate very close by, and
follow the orange eyes to the Gatekeeper‚Äôs home. His home is to the
left of the gate a short distance. Here you will be presented with
the first challenge. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gatekeeper often gets bored, as many days will pass without a
single visitor to these parts. He has devised a way to amuse
himself while he is here. While he knows the Olde Forest well, he
is often amused by leading travellers astray. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You must be sure of your path before you set off on the next part
of your journey. All is not always as it seems. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Second Challenge: Night Vision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You next meet a band of Elves that camp in these woods.These Elves
live within a colony of Entmoot. They have the ability to
communicate with the Entmoot in a most unique way. It will be your
task to learn this language before you will learn of the next step
in your quest. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Third Challenge: Perseverance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your travels will eventually lead you to the ancient Golems of the
deeper woodlands. These Golems are not fond of visitors at all -
many times they will remain perfectly still as to not attract your
attention. They WILL be watching you so take care not to offend
them. Nothing ruins the day quite so fast as getting slammed (in)to
the ground by an angry giant. If you are respectful, you may find
one of the Elders are willing to share the location of the
MuggleScript. These Rock Golems detest any type of noise, climbing
over them, harming the forest or clumsily waving torches around.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MuggleScript&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is vital that you carefully scribe your names onto the
MuggleScript and replace it precisely where you found it. Do not
attempt to take the MuggleScript with you, as a terrible curse will
be cast upon your party if the parchment is moved from its resting
place. If you remove one of the treasures nearby, be sure to place
another one in its place lest you anger the Forest Gods.&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: B11W3ZC - Stage 1 - The Beginning&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Small lock-n-lock tucked beside a boulder&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: B21W3ZC - Stage 2 - The Writing&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Small lock-n-lock in a rock pile.&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: B31W3ZC - Stage 3 - The Golems&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Regular size container between large boulders&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: BF1W3ZC - FINAL Location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Small Ammo Box wedged between boulders.&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: R11W3ZC - The Ent Council&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ¬∞ __ . ___ W/E ___ ¬∞ __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Reference point: Group of trees where players will be required to perform a projection.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a great cache!! Without the teamwork of everyone there (and a PAF) this one would have been a DNF.  Cachers use many things to help in their search. The attributes. The D/T rating. The container size. Previous logs. And previous experience of the cache owner's hides. It was this last one that had us all suspicious of the first Stage (only after searching for a while and returning to re-read). We all learned from this caching experience.  It was very well set-up and thought out. Without a doubt, one we will remember for a long time. </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Oh wow,  this was a stumper.  Our first clue that we weren't doing something right should have been how easy it was to find the first stage.  This is a BFL, it can't be THAT easy, and it wasn't.  We set off and searched and searched and searched.  We read the description, once, twice, maybe even three times.  It was decided that we should start over as it was felt we were missing something, and so we were!  Thanks to Treknschmidt and phone a friend!  Why does it seem so easy when you know what you are doing?  

Off we went on a bit of a walk.  The pines at night was pretty cool.  I really wish I could have taken a picture that captured the essence of what it was like to be there.  Stage two was found and the deciphering started.  We had to do a little work to get it right but what we really wanted to know was how do you plot this out in advance?  While working out stage three we saw some lights on the trail.  I thought we were a little odd being out at night hiking but these guys were on bikes!   Coordinates input it was off to stage three. 

This stage proved a little elusive. Searchers should pay attention to the note about getting slammed.  The Golems are serious about that.   Our newbie cacher, Fletchworks found this stage.  Bakers Dozen having learned from the first stage figured out what to do. 

The final required a bit of a hunt.  The great thing about going as a group is there are many eyes looking for the cache. 

Another wonderful BFL cache.  Thanks so much for organizing the event and placing some very inventive geocaches. </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one was quite the lengthy and time consuming night cache. Someone told us earlier in the day that it took their group 2.5 hours to do this one and we now understand why. Stage 1 had us fooled. Stage 2 took some time to figure out and still we were wondering. Stage 3 we pretty much gave up on after a lot of searching and searching in completely the wrong side, but then got lucky on our way back to the trail and found the stage in a totally different spot than we were searching, but we figured it out based on the description. Final had us searching once again and had to expand our search to find it. All 3 of our GPSes were atleast 10m off on stage 3 and the final. If it wasn't for a couple of calls to a phone a friend, then we would probably still be there there. Looking at the cache page now, I see that there are hints that we didn't even think of looking at while doing this one and that would have helped us greatly and probably saved us a lot of time. All 3 stages were definitely unique in their own way. This one took us atleast a couple hours.</groundspeak:text>

The highlight of the this one had to be a dozen or more cachers, sitting/standing in the middle of the woods, silent, with flashlights off waiting for something to happen..lol
And an added bonus...a group FTF!

The trail offers many scenic views of the river and of the millrace constructed in the 1860's that used to power the village's gristmill. The trail has a length of 2.5 km and can be used year-round. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located along The Millrace Footpath, at times it may be a busy area, especially in the weekends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache contains log only, please BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace as found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located in a partially submerged cave, reachable by canoe or small boat.  The coordinates will get you to the mouth of the cave, but the method of searching the inside of the submerged cave will be up to you. You are looking for a black 35mm film canister with log only.  Please BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an admission fee to use the facilities within the park and canoe rentals are available seasonally.</groundspeak:long_description>

My Oregon had a broken digitizer and my wife's iPhone didn't have the OpenCaching app so I navigated here by memory. It didn't take long to find what had to be the right cave, but even after several attempts by different members of our party (including myself) we couldn't find a cache.

We all found a dock spider which caused some of us to get a bit worried, but I doubt he was hiding the cache. There were the remnants of a large nest in there, but I don't think that a cache was concealed in it either (I felt around a bit) so unless we were in the wrong cave (or the hide is tougher than the difficulty level would indicate) I think that this one is gone. I have a picture of the cave mouth if you'd like to verify that we were in the right spot before taking action.</groundspeak:text>

I seemed to recall something about it from my last visit. I had walked right past here but hadn't found the cache. At first I thought I'd passed it up, but when I read the description it looked interesting so we started searching.

After a couple of minutes I remembered something and checked the logs, and sure enough a previous finder had reported it missing, so we threw in the towel.</groundspeak:text>

Ontario. Also known as St Joseph Pioneer Cemetery.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The property for the cemetery and church was donated by Matthew
McCann and John Mulholland in 1856. Construction of the church was
started on March 18th of that year. In 1887 the congregation needed
more room so they bought a church in Acton which they renamed St
Joseph's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church building on this site was sold, torn down and became
a private residence elsewhere. There is a sign showing the location
of where the church used to stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lock on the gate is to keep vehicles out. There is a latch
on top of the gate to let people in.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I came back to find this cache after finding &quot;Claustrophobic Cave Crawl&quot;. (Thanks so much for linking to that cache from the description for this one). It was the hottest part of the day so it was a real relief to wade through the water and cool off. I didn't have a GPSr since I broke my digitizer crawling out of the last cave, but I was pretty sure where this one was and it turns out that I was right . Last time I was in the series of caves directly above this one, but I couldn't find a way down.

I was quite surprised by the size and shape of the cave, and it was a bit of a slither to get to the cache, but it was pretty easy compared to the last one.  No technology was harmed in the finding of this cache.

When we emerged from the cave there was a large group of muggles in canoes and one of them asked me what was in there. I told him &quot;Secrets&quot;, which surprisingly enough seemed like a good enough answer for him.

We ended up returning here by canoe later in the day after a string of DNFs on the water. This really is a nice spot. Many years ago I attended a wedding at the mill ruins, but it was such a cold day that we didn't even venture this far to look at the falls. Pity.

Thanks for hiding a great cache in a really spectacular spot. TNLN</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">decided to got for this after a long week at work and what a treat
the canoe trip to the cave was indeed pleasant 
once we got close to the bridge it got quite shallow so we hopped out of the canoe and walked the last few meters, all good water was half way up my calf than i took the next step to the left and water was suddenly hip high and after next step was waist high lol...luckily the water was nice and warm
once we pulled the canoe on the rocks by the cave dfx jumped right in, while i was getting ready to take some pictures
when i pointed the flashlight in the ceiling looked like it was covered in glitter, no idea what that is but sure is beautiful
when first spot dfx checked didn;t turn out anything i pointed my flashlight around and there it was just a bit above where dfx was standing, although is not concealed by a rock as the description says
tftc and the adventure, excellent  job at finding such a great spot [:D]

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">this one was the main goal of today's trip, and what a different kind of after-work cache this was. the canoe trip was very pleasant (only our third time taking it out) and we arrived at the cave without major problems - we had to wade the last few meters, as the water was getting too shallow.

wasting no time, i crawled right into it, and wow, didn't expect it to be that big (relatively speaking), and it was sparkly too! i had to crawl around quite a bit to find the cache, and didn't see it until t4e was pointing me towards it, as i was concentrating my search on the wrong elevation. got nicely dirty too, but thankfully the water to clean myself was just outside the cave [:P]

while searching, i spotted something that resembled camo tape at first glace. at a closer look, it turned out to be a frog! just sitting there, watching me, not moving at all.

many thanks for this adventure [:D]</groundspeak:text>

I had it on my mind to do this cache today, so I made sure I took an extra pair of shoes with me as my intent was to walk across the water to this cache and that is exactly what I did...twice! I put on my old shoes, rolled up my pants to about my knees and had no problem crossing the water and it was below my knees in the deepest part. Once I got into the cave, Mr. Girls Phind Squirrels was already in there, so we chatted a bit and then headed out. This was definitely a memorable experience and I am glad we decided to do this one today. Later we passed by again after doing another cache and watched several canoers going for it and also the odd person wading through too like I did.</groundspeak:text>

As soon as I heard this was a cave that required a water crossing I knew I had to give it a go.  My caching partner Bakers Dozen was also up for it.  Off we went.  I forgot the flashlight and by the time I returned BD had already found it but was good enough to let me find it myself.  

So many geocachers were here today but not so many went for this one.  This was a great little cache, thanks!  </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located within Rockwood Conservation area you will find numerous caves and potholes, a geological playground. This cache is located in one of the more difficult caves to get to within the park but will give you the true experience of &quot;caving&quot;.  The coordinates will get you to the mouth of the cave, which is an entry hole at ground level about 2.5ft in diameter.  You will be required to crawl through the opening for a distance of a few feet at which point the cave opens up into a fairly large room which you can stand up in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of side chambers you can explore once you are in and the glittery ceiling will catch your eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a good flashlight, and prepare to get dirty.  Protective headgear is advisable, since rocks on noggins can hurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once in the main chamber the cache can be located on the left hand side of the wall furthest from the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please do not do this cache alone, always cave with a partner.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to get to the cave entrance, you can follow the trailhead at N43 36.694 W080 08.531 and follow the trail along the face of the cliff.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first Open Cache! And what a great way to start. I may have to retroactively log some of my cross listed finds.

About a month ago I found myself standing outside the entrance to this cave. I was hiking alone with Dakota. I had hoped that I could enter the cave safely and find the cache, but when I took a look at the size of the opening I decided it wasn't worth the risk. Besides, I'd left Dakota tied to a tree at a fork in the trail where I'd climbed down a small cliff face and I was a bit worried about him.

Today I returned with my wife and some co-workers. As we met in the parking lot I was starting to get worried about my ability to fit through the hole. It was starting to seem pretty small in my memory. When we got to the base of the cliff I realized that it was even smaller than I remembered. This was our goal however, so I flopped down on my belly and tried to slither in. I had to turn on my side at one point, but after that I was able to squeeze through into the large chamber.

After assuring those outside that there was lots of room I was soon joined by Fraser and Sonja. As we got more people in the cave we had more voices to entreat the others to come in after us. I was surprised when almost everyone in our group finally chose to crawl in. Even the ones who had assured me before we left that they wouldn't crawl through the mud made the trip, and we ended up with eight people in the tiny cave. We still had room for more, and we crawled around a bit exploring some of the deeper chambers, but we soon found passages that even our skinniest members weren't willing to enter.

When we finally left I really goofed. I've explored many caves in the last few years, and found caches in several. I almost always leave my GPSr outside, but this time I brought it in with me to have access to the description. Cave caches can be a bit tricky to find without notes. When I pulled the Oregon out of my pocket after crawling out however there was a fine spiderweb of cracks on the screen and the touch sensor wasn't working. I must have pushed it down on a rock as I was twisting around to get out.

I didn't even need to bring the unit into the cave. I spotted the cache before I was even fully inside since it was a little exposed. I took care to cover it properly before leaving to ensure that it doesn't get muggled. We also spotted another 'cache' over the entrance of the cave (on the inside), a small tupperware with some trinkets in it. It had no logbook, but I left it in place and moved it aside to keep it out of view as well.

All in all a truly excellent cache. If only I could give it a favourite on the cluttered geocaching site so that more people would find out about it :-) TNLN</groundspeak:text>

County.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This pioneer cemetery dates back to 1828. The land was donated
by Mr. McCormick who is rumored to be the first person buried here.
The cemetery was renovated by the Eramosa Council in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the stones have been moved to the display in the
center there are still pieces scattered around. One such piece is
visible near the cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is room in the cache for geocoins and small travel

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in an abandoned cemetary where an old
Catholic church once stood north west of Alma, Ontario. I know
little about the cemetery but will add details to this page as I
uncover them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice quiet area with some old headstones, mostly
dating between 1830 and 1880. You can still see the few remains of
the old church from the bricks scattered under the grass. Enjoy the
area while you're visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARKING&lt;br /&gt;
The best bet for parking is at the waypoint included with this
cache. This location is right beside the cemetery along the side of
the road. This shouldn't be a problem during the spring/summer/fall
seasons as a car can easily fit on the shoulder. I don't know yet
what it'll be like in the winter. If you have any problems with
parking, you can park &lt;u&gt;temporarily&lt;/u&gt; at the end of the laneway
of the property immediately opposite of the cemetery with the
property owners permission. They know of the cache and are friendly
towards respectful cachers. Do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; park in the
laneway/driveway of any other private property in the area. If this

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A travel bug trading post just north of Fergus along Highway 6 -
a popular north/south travel route. The location is at a ghost town
named Cumnock. You'll still find the town name on Google Maps and
associated with the 2 forests on either side of Hwy 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can easily accommodate a number of trackables so feel
free to drop any you picked up while traveling along the
highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like Ponsonby, Cumnock began as a stopping place on one of the
early pioneer trails. It was founded in 1852 by a James Samson who
emigrated from Scotland. With a partner, John Muir, they built a
hotel and named it the Red Lion Hotel. Later, Muir opened his own
hotel and named it the British Hotel in competition with his former
partner. Samson then added a store to his growing list of business
and opened the town‚Äôs first post office naming it after
Cumnock in Scotland. The village grew to include a blacksmith, a
cheese factory, a shoemaker, a flax mill, a sawmill, and a small
number of houses.


As the railroads came through the area, traffic along the roads
dwindled and the town began to decline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Some cachers in the Counties of Lambton, Huron, Oxford and
Bruce,set up the C.C. Series to get people to visit their local
cemeteries. We thought it was an excellent idea to follow their
lead and set up a series in &lt;strong&gt;Grey&lt;/strong&gt; County, which is
called &lt;strong&gt;G.C.C.Series&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone wanting to add one in
other regions of Grey County, please do so, just enter &quot; G.C.C.
Series - &quot; and the name of their cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;The beginning of St. Paul's Lutheran Church of the twelfth
concession of Normanby dates back to 1859 when a request for a
pastor, Rev. Charles Rechenberg, was sent by the Canada Synod. He
conducted the first Christian service on September 25, 1859 and
organized St. Paul's congregation.&lt;br /&gt;
Thirty-seven members, mostly heads of families made up the charter
roll. In the same year, one acre of land was procured from Paul
Mueller. The first elders were Jacob Weber and John Weltz. The
first trustees were George Schenk, John Lantz and George
Hartman.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1859 one acre of land, across from the Church was donated by
Mr.&amp; Mrs. Daniel Hollinger. Here the first GERMAN Lutheran
Setters in the area were buried. The first burial was Maria
Frohlich in 1856. Some names in the cemetery are: HAAK, WEBER,
WEBER BAETZ, HILL, KNAPP, HOPF, KROLLER, WEIGEL, WEPPLER, PETER,
HOLM, BRUK, RUPPENTHAL, DEMMERLING, AND ORTMANN . This is just a
small list of names. Most of the above names are related.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is an active cemetery, so please have respect and absolutely
NO NIGHT CACHING PLEASE!! The cache is big enough for a log only,

speak. The cache is big enough for a log only, so bring your own
writing instrument.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some cachers in the Counties of Lambton, Perth, Huron, and Bruce,
set up the C.C. Series to get people to visit their local
cemeteries. We thought it was an excellent idea to follow their
lead and set up a series in Grey County, which is called G.C.C.
Series.&lt;br /&gt;
As genealogists we feel this is a way to honour and respect our
ancestors. Thanks for the great idea! Anyone wanting to add one in
other regions of Grey County please do so, just enter G.C.C. Series
and the name of their cache. These caches will take you to some
large and some small cemeteries to focus on the history, family and
friends who have gone before us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please, always be respectful in these areas. This is a non-active
cemetery, so please have respect and absolutely NO NIGHT CACHING
PLEASE!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cemetery is listed as being at Concession 1 NDR Lot 16 -
Bentinck Township West. The name on the fence says St. George
Cemetery with dates of 1847 to 1968. That is all the info I can
find out about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates listed will not lead you to the cache but to a
grave stone. What you have to do is, find the age of this person
when he died and add the numbers together. (treat them as single
digits)&lt;br /&gt;
From this number, subtract 8. The number that is left is subtracted
from the North Co-ordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
Next, add all the numbers that are in the date of his death
together. (treat them as single digits) To this number add 22.
Using this number, subtract it from the West Co-ordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
The resulting co-ordinates will take you to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congrats

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our very first cache was GCG5H5 McGowan Falls so it has a fond
place in our hearts. Since that cache was archived we thought that
this area deserved another as it is the only falls in our area
without one and it has a lot to offer. This is a fairly simple
multi with one offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the posted coordinates (stage 1) you will find the
coordinates for the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to explore the Riverview Trail west towards the
middle dam where you will find another swimming area, playground
and washrooms. The trail east leads into the Durham Conservation
camp ground with more trails and facilities. Pack a picnic, your
fishing poles and swimsuits, there are so many great spots along
this stretch of the Saugeen river!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a bit of history of the the falls from the SVCA site:
The area formerly known as the home of Edge's Mill, hosts a
spectacular falls which has been named McGowan Falls as atribute to
one of the historical pioneer families of Durham. Samuel and James
Edge came into possession of land along the Saugeen River in 1847,
which included the present day McGowan Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert McGowan bought the Edge property in 1888. The McGowan
family started operating &quot;The People's Mill&quot; at the falls, along
with other water powered mills on the Saugeen in 1888, which
produced flour, oatmeal and many other by products associated with
the milling of grain. Beginning in 1890, local electric power would
be generated compliments of this beautiful, natural attraction.
Tormented by flood and fire under the supervision of John McGowan,
the People's Mill perished. The flume and waterwheel deteriorated
and disappeared, but the dam, after extensive repairs, today serves
as a recreational and conservation flood control project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durham Conservation Area is situated in an ideal location,
nestled along a picturesque stretch of the winding Saugeen River.
It is also a leisurely trek from the heart of the Durham town
centre. It covers over 61 ha (150 acres) including over 3 kms (2
miles) of Saugeen River frontage. Scenic McGowan Falls is one of
the highlights of this beautiful park. McGowan Falls gorge is a
wonderful stop along the trail. you'll often see fishermen near
this area, angling for that prized catch in the cool waters
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail surface consists of a combination of gravel, grass and
hard packed earth and rock. For more information check out the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitgrey.ca/travel-experiences/waterfalls-and-waterways/waterfall-tour/&quot;&gt;Waterfall Tour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svca.on.ca/ca.php?page=durham&quot;&gt;Durham

number for the combination lock on the cache. The posted
coordinates are for the final.

&lt;p&gt;This pretty little creek recently received a name due to the
efforts of a local family and their friends. Please read the
article in the web page link near the top. Bell creek crosses our
property so we are glad that it finally has a name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 3 stages are quick stops at various places where the
creek crosses the road. At each one you will find a number on the
sign post. Record these in order as they are the combination to
open the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice other signs where Bell creek crosses the road but
you do not have to stop at those. However at one of them I caught
the biggest speckled trout in my life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creek runs through some private property so please stay on
the road allowance except at the final which is on SVCA property.
As you approach along the river you may catch a glimpse of the busy
beavers working here or some of the other abundant wildlife. This
is near where Bell creek ends as it meets the Saugeen River. Your
ears will lead you to the best place to see the merry creek racing
down to join the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the final you are seaching for a small hide-a-key container.
Please ensure the cache is locked, scramble the combo and close the
cover over the dials after you sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visiting this tiny village is almost like a trip back in time as
many of the original buildings from the mid to late 1800's are
still standing. Historical plaques have been placed on some of the

nearby plaque explains that Priceville was one of the last

Within walking distance of the village is the entrance to an
extensive conservation area with delightful trails crossing a
creek, then meandering through forested areas that break into open
views of old meadows. Grey-Sauble, working with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theflesherton.ca/pdfs/walking%20village%20flyer%20small.pdf&quot;&gt;Walking Village Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, is currently
developing a figure-8 loop hiking trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a 3 stage multicache that will take you on a pleasant walk
to explore this peaceful forest. The posted coordinates are for the
first stage where you will find a tag with the coordinates to the
next stage and then the final.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have enjoyed walking here with our dogs while observing much
flora and fauna along the way. Please take pictures and leave
nothing but footprints!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Was caching in the area with my wife, daughter, brook22 and hubcap33 today. This one was quite the adventure. We found the first 2 stages and then continued along on the trail towards the final, except the trail led us into a large pit so we went up the side and the trail disappeared so decided to go through the tall grasses and then as I was dragging our 2 year old daughter behind me in her stroller, suddenly my leg went all the way into a hole in the ground and the others said I disappeared. Lost my shoe in the hole and got it back out and we continued on our way and then came across the trail that led us to the final. After finding the cache we continued along the trail which took us quite a bit out of the park as we saw on our GPS maps. Eventually we found ourselves in some kind of workshop (?) area in the middle of the woods with 3 abandoned cars, tonnes of atvs and lots of other &quot;junk&quot;. We picked a trail that seemed to go where we wanted, but it zig-zagged, but eventuallyh we got to a trail that took us close to where we came in. What an adventure it was and we even lost a wheel to the stroller, one of 3 that we would lose today. I think we hiked about 3 times as far as we had to.</groundspeak:text>

Once on top of the hill, you can see the stacks in the town of Falconbridge in one direction, the ones in Coniston and even the Super Stack!  The coordinates are for the cache; you‚Äôre looking for a 2 kg plastic olive container under rocks (good thing it wasn‚Äôt buried at the start of the climb eh?).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our second hide!  It‚Äôs a traditional cache that leads you to prime blueberry picking spots in Greater Sudbury.  We got the cache container at a cache exchange at the 3rd Annual Sudbury Geocache Hike &amp; Seek.  Ours was from Ted who challenged us to hide it as is, so please leave the container as you find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to get to the cache but we suggest you park off Notre Dame Ave. at these coordinates: N 46 32.061, W 080 58.786 and follow the trail in.  You might be able to ride the trail if you have a 4x4 vehicle.  There is a creek crossing at the start of your walk where you might be able to skip across on rocks but depending on the water level, you might need rubber boots.  The rest of the trail also has lots of huge puddles but you can usually walk next to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates are for the cache.  I have spotted wildlife while on mountain bike rides back here so please be mindful of that.  Also be careful as you make your way to the hiding spot as the rocks can be slippery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache Original Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Log book and pencil&lt;br/&gt;-FTF prize&lt;br/&gt;-Big rubber ducky&lt;br/&gt;-VW Beetle toy&lt;br/&gt;-Golf thingny&lt;br/&gt;-Land Shark pin&lt;br/&gt;-Calculator and pen&lt;br/&gt;-Yummy erasers&lt;br/&gt;-Diabetes wrist band&lt;br/&gt;-Fishing Lure&lt;br/&gt;-Coloring pencils&lt;br/&gt;-IP-SUISSE sticker&lt;br/&gt;-Trans Canada Trail patch</groundspeak:long_description>

We love to go there and pick blueberries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of this area is a bit tricky to nail down, but what I know is this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current location of the Goldlands cemetery was the former location of the community of Goldlands, which was burned to the ground in the Porcupine Fire of 1911 that decimated much of the area from Porcupine to Porquis Junction. The grave markers that were mostly made of wood were destroyed and the burial records were destroyed along with the church. You will notice that the area of the graveyard near the cache appears empty, but this is just because nobody actually knows where the graves are located in this area. I have never been able to find any evidence of the community in my explorations of the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has also been a rumour that some gold was buried in the area and people have tried to find it for years. So far - no luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a camouflaged 1.5 litre mayonnaise jar and should be winter friendly.</groundspeak:long_description>
