 This area is known by old timers as &quot;Snowden's&quot;.  Snowden's used to be a little store in the area that would sell liquor to anybody, any age, maaaaany years ago.  It was a popular place, and fortunately for us responsible parents, it's no longer there!  Nowadays when people talk about Snowden's, they are referring to the bridge that is a popular place for kids to hang out in the summer time.  Of course, jumping off the bridge is illegal, so the cops are always running the kids off.  The county has now made a small parking area for people who want to fish or just hang out and look at the bay.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
If you attempt to find this cache, try not to panic.&lt;br/&gt;
I think you should just log the DNF and end your search.&lt;br/&gt;
But if your alter ego insists, then a find I cannot
guarantee.&lt;br/&gt;
It just proves that your a caching maniac,&lt;br/&gt;
and you may need help from a professional shrink.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I will help you on your journey to find it.&lt;br/&gt;
I made this container while sitting on my porch.&lt;br/&gt;
It is quite tiny, a pico - that I am sure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Where the cache really is; is anyone's guess.&lt;br/&gt;
Is it a leaf above your head or a bottlecap beneath your
feet?&lt;br/&gt;
I would of just logged the DNF by now, how about you?&lt;br/&gt;
Stay if you must, soon you will just be another DNF victim.&lt;br/&gt;
If you find without the hint, you are a caching champ.&lt;br/&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Gated Park - observe park hours. $1.50 per person on weekends and
holidays. Cache is just off the nature trail. Might need some
skeeter spray.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This pleasant little area is where I spent most of my time as kid. We used to ride our bikes up and down the hills and spend most of our time off the ground, up in the trees. If you look hard enough in some of the trees you may even see my initials, which I carved many, many years ago. 

You will not find this cache if you keep your feet on the floor. So, if you are afriad of heights I would suggest that you bring along a buddy who can help you with the dirty work. You do not need to climb to the top; however, you will need to go up a bit. 

I chose the attribute &quot;Difficut Climb&quot; just to specify that climbing was nessecary. No gear is required.

The container is small... large enough for small trade items and TBS.

Good luck and be safe!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
I remember watching this project from its infancy to the present as
I drove by each day for work. Lane closures were a bit of a pain
but it certainly did entertain for the few minutes each day. The
other day I finally got a chance to walk the Wyland Walk and
realized this mural is much better up close.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is plenty of parking nearby – I recommend parking at
Walgreens if you have little artists or Walmart for daredevils.
Feel free to post as many pictures as possible of the mural. I love
looking at different aspects of it. please include in your find
what you like or dislike about the mural. Hope you enjoy it as much
as do. BYOP - no room for swag please rehide cache well</groundspeak:long_description>

 This is a fun one, should take a moment to find this mad cow and then you can choose either a cool crisp $1 bill or a Florida Lottery Ticket - yes I said OR - so, 1st to find has choice, 2nd to find gets what the 1st to find left behind! Have fun and post a log! You might want too look out this area is covered with Turnpike workers and there is usually an undercover police car nearby giving out speeding tickets, so check your doped it's 35 thru here...

Oh the ettiquet questions! Do I go back &amp; sign the log twice!? Surely not.  What about trackables? 
For now I will leave the big questions like this for later and log this as my first official opencaching.com find.  I'll have to check and see what other caches i've already been to. ;)

This is an easy cache on a nice island in Lake Worth, Florida. I only rated it &quot;5&quot; because you need a boat or kayak to get there! But once you are on the island, it's not hard to find. There are nice picnic areas too... While your there practice some CITO, there are plenty of trash cans in the area as well. Be careful not to run into one of the many spiderwebs! I recommend wearing long pants because the area is slightly overgrown and there are plants that do &quot;bite&quot;, sort of....</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a container about 4 inches long and one inch diameter. There is a log but no pen so bring your own.

This cache is about out in a portion of Loxahatchee Slough Natural Area.
 
I placed it off the ground. Think ornament. There is a lot of Feral Hog activity out here, and I just wanted the caches out of their reach.

~15 ft accuracy on this one, but you'll know where to look.

Bring water and snacks.

Everyone at one time or another has played the &quot;shell game&quot;. Well this cache is just like it. The coordinates will get you there and then it's up to you to guess which &quot;shell&quot; the &quot;pea&quot; is under..You have 3 possibilities. Once found, sign in and replace in the same &quot;shell&quot;. I call this a mutiple choice micro. There is an emergency pencil but BYOP just in case.

Congratulations to the “famous” caching family
of rngirl, Froggy girl, and Zeke the Peak on FTF.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can anyone geocache in northern Palm Beach County for long
and not know these names, that of Bonsairad as mentioned by Zeke or
rangergirl141 who gets the STF. Thank you all for your caches I
have found along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to note that this was the first find of a cache I own and
the day of my 100th find. Mrs Egger and I did not know about my
cache being found when we the started out in Tequesta heading south
on US 1 toward PGA Blvd to find 4 caches I needed to get to 100. It
was not until I was entering them that I realized that rngirl owned
my finds #97, #98, and #99. It was by plan that number my #100 is
owned by Bonsairad as was my first find. &lt;strong&gt;Thanks to all
again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was about as far as my little car could drive. Exploring new places is by far the most enjoyable part about geocaching - once I get a new vehicle I will have to see what lies down this path.  I certainly was not expecting to find a derelict house down this road.

As I was scouting this area I noticed some very cool tree parts sticking up out of the ground.  I suppose they are technically roots but they look more like woody stalagmites rising from the Earth.

This is an area we have been driving past for months saying that it would be a great location for a cache - today we finally stopped!  Florida never ceases to amaze me in that you can get to somewhere that feels so secluded and still be only a handful of steps from a dozen businesses.  You are hunting for a cammo'd Rubbermaid container.

For a Hirogen, it is all about the hunt for the prey. This series is intended to challenge you in unique and interesting ways.

To find this prey, you will need to use all of your geo-senses. The posted coordinates will take you to a location where the final coordinates may be revealed.

This prey is extremely cunning and can recognize neophyte cachers before they are even out of their vehicles. Approach with caution!

The final cache is located in an area prone to alligators, snakes, fire ants, attack birds and other hazards so please do not attempt alone.

FTF gets a fifty dollar bill located in the bag with the log book and accolades in this description.

Everyone who finds this cache (without a hint) will be rewarded with the rank of Gamma Hirogen which is the lowest rank in the Hirogen hierarchy. Beta Hirogen is the next rank and is achieved only by the most tenacious hunters. The highest rank attainable is that of Alpha Hirogen. Put simply, the Alpha Hirogen has outstanding hunting skills and is the best of the best.

To attain the two highest ranks, you must have found the preceding cache for the lower rank without a hint. No skipping ranks.

A special prize will be awarded to the first team to attain Alpha Hirogen status. Log entries will determine the victor.

'The wildlife alone made this one of my favorites!! We had a relatively close encounter with a Bald Eagle, a Great Blue Heron that allowed us to pass within 10 feet of him, and several small birds that were moving too fast for me to identify them. 

I can't wait to see if Tryllast can turn some of his incorrect bizarre theories into caches!!

Great execution on this cache, thank you!
The cache container, as other have said, does not latch closed however, all the contents appeared to be safe and sound.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My friend Bjorn is a brilliant chef from Stockholm. We correspond on a regular basis, and I’ve been telling him about Geocaching. Recently, Bjorn surprised me by telling me he hid a cache on his last trip to the United States. Bjorn’s not much of a computer person, so he mailed me a letter explaining where the cache was hidden. Since Bjorn doesn’t even know how to spell GPS, I had to find it the hard way. Once I found it, I nabbed the coordinates so everybody could join in.

Since Bjorn did go to the trouble of hiding this cache, I’ve added a rather unique requirement for logging a find; Obviously, you need to sign the logbook. You also must post your log in Bjorn’s native language, so that he can read them. No English allowed! LOL! Here’s a copy of the letter Bjorn sent, which should explain the difficulty I had in locating the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Good evening fellow cachers, and welcome to the Seminole Ranch Conservation Area.
Break out your flashlights &amp; skeeter repelant. This is gonna be a lotta fun!

I was speaking with Jo Anna Babar of the St. John's River Water Management District about hiding another night cache, and I was bemoaning the scarcity of locations that are swampy, critter infested, and accessible after sunset. She suggested this area, formerly home to Fergie Le Frog's &quot;Reflection Cache&quot; (GCGXYG), and after some initial scouting, I gotta say, &quot;Thanx Jo Anna&quot;!

Park at the posted coordinates, which is on Hatbill Rd, off of State Rd 46, a little over 4 miles West of I-95. Proceed on foot roughly 0.43 miles west along the main grade, then slightly north, to N28* 37.205 W080* 58.366, where you'll find three reflectors in a triangle shape, stapled to a tree.

From here, shine your light around till you locate a small reflective marker stapled to another tree. Proceed to this marker, then look for the next marker. Sounds easy, right? Heh!

Jo Anna asked that I stick to existing game trails when the foiliage got too thick, to reduce our impact on the property, which is why your trail meanders all over the place. At some point near the end of the reflector trail, you'll find a tree with a 3 pointed reflective star. Affixed to this tree is a soda bottle preform with the final coordinates inside. From here, continue to follow markers, which will lead you out of the woods. Whwn you find three reflectors pointed down, continue that direction for about 50' and you'll be out of the woods. Watch your step coming out of the woods, as there are ankle breaking holes and dilapidated barbed wire waiting to ruin your day.

As with my other night cache, the marker rules are very simple; If the arrow is pointing up, go straight. If it points right or left, go that direction. If it points slightly right or left, turn slightly in that direction.

I strongly recommend you do not attempt this cache alone. These woods are somewhat perilous during broad daylight, as they are replete with venomous snakes, wild hogs, nasty spiders, and other critters that go &quot;bump&quot; in the night. The perils are significantly increased once the sun sets.

To survive your quest, I suggest you wear rugged boots, long pants and a long sleeve shirt. Bring bug spray, lots of water, at least two flashlights, a spare GPSr, a cell phone, extra batteries and a stout walking stick.

I spoke with a Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife officer regarding this cache, and he requested that folks attempting it leave a cache page printout, or something denoting the fact that they are geocaching, on their dashboards. He advised that, when they find vehicles in the parking lot at night, they assume the owners are poaching, and hoof into the woods in search of them. By placing a cache page printout on your dash, they'll know why you're out there. Please leave your firearms at home, since possession of a gun is an arrestable offense in these woods.

The encrypted hint is actually the coordinates for the tree with the soda bottle preform attached to it. In the event that Mother Nature wipes out a section of reflectors, you'll be able to decrypt the hint and finish the hunt.

FTF prize is a silver 1968 Juego De La XIX Olimpiada Mexico 25 Pesos coin.

Good luck!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We again joined forces with The Kelt and Navigatrix to seize another night cache.  The night started with a nice relaxing drive, even though we were stuck behind a slow bunch of cars, to the parking area at GZ.  Once we parked, we quickly hopped out of the car and felt the crisp cold air, so we added another layer of clothing, suited up, and headed out to the hog trap.  Along the way we saw something we have not seen in awhile, a crystal-clear view of the stars.  We soon arrived at the hog trap and started our frolic (or swagger) through the dark and cold woods.  Unlike Mr. Riffster’s other night cache, we did not encounter much wildlife, except for the unlimited amount of spiders and the &quot;smells like something is dead.&quot; Shortly after we passed the &quot;smells like something is dead,&quot; we came across a small patch of land that recharged or sense of smell with wild mint and irises. Later on our trek, we heard what sounded like people using semiautomatic handguns from airboats for unsavory reasons, but as we stomped through the woods, we were relieved that the shots seem to be getting further and further away.  Once we arrived at the Klingon looking reflectors, The Kelt quickly found the micro and we loaded up the coords in our Garmins.  Then a literal hop, skip, and a jump away to avoid barbed wire and holes in the ground we made it back to the main trail.  We scampered to the final GZ, and again The Kelt made the find.  We left a rubber ducky and after much negotiating, we took wiggle headed pen.  On the trip back, The Kelt made contact with Geolytical (it was great meeting you) and we all met for a pint at an Irish Pub and traded geo-war stories.  Thanks Trev and Miriam for another fun night of caching!  Mr. Riffster, thanks for another wonderful cache experience! </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A kwick glance at the cache page might lead you to suspect that the Riffster Clan was suddenly in the business of spiritual conversion. Au Contraire Mon Frair! You see, in this case, the statement was issued as an expletive, and should not be considered an agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;expliquez, s'il vous plaît?&lt;/i&gt; Of Course! Telling embarrassing tales about myself is one of my favorite past times!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I found myself in Cocoa the other day, with Mark &amp; Peggy of The JailBirds, eating dinner at a restaurant that serves Americanized Spanish food such as burritos and enchiladas. While the food is pretty good, what sets this place apart is their sauce bar, where they have multiple dispensers, brimming with potential pain. This place labels its sauces with cartoon faces, with a smiley [:)] for &quot;Mild&quot; and a death mask [xx(] for &quot;You Gotta Be Kidding Me!&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I learned a while back that I wasn't man enough for the really hot stuff, so I thought I would try one degree milder, which was marked with a frowny face [:(]. I saturated my burrito with the stuff, and commenced wolfing it down, admiring right away the forehead sweats and scalp tingle that comes with a really good hot sauce. Apparently, this particular sauce has a delay built into it, because as I took my last bite, it hit me all at once, smacking me right between the eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Holy Mother Of God!&quot;&lt;/b&gt; I exclaimed at the top of my lungs, as I dove for my beverage and several handfuls of chips. Once again, I've proven to the entire free world, that I'm dumber than a bag of hammers. Perhaps I should invest in an mp3 player that loops words to the effect of, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Hey Riffster, if a place that specializes in hot sauce tells you a sauce is hot, maybe you should freekin' listen to them!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Just sayin'... Apparently, my agony was amusing, as Mark &amp; Peggy began utilizing the aforementioned expletive catch phrase to define any situation that seriously kicks your butt.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The next day, we met up with Vince, of The Flatouts, and splashed our kayaks at N 28* 39.957 / W 080* 54.686, for an exploratory paddle upstream, just to see where it went. The area to the north of the launch site is one of Florida's largest natural watersheds, comprising over 5,000 acres, all of which is channeled down 6 Mile Creek during times of rain. Central Florida had been inundated with gobs of rain recently, turning 6 Mile Creek into a swift moving river. As we worked our way upstream, the river banks grew closer together, forcing the steady flow of water through an ever narrowing channel, requiring greater and greater efforts to continue upstream. We made it through the torrent, into the primary wetland, and it was like someone turned off a fire hydrant. The gush turned to a sedate trickle, and we breathed a collective, though premature, sigh of relief, thinking the worst was behind us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because of the high water, the plain was mostly flooded, with clumps of grass poking through the water's surface. We hoped to find the main channel, so we could continue upstream, however, I fell victim to illusion. Scanning the plain, we found water flowing in from several directions, and after a few false starts, I finally detected what appeared to be the strongest current, which, I assumed must be the channel. In just a few strokes, we found ourselves hopelessly mired in submerged obstructions, requiring Herculean efforts just to move a few feet. After what felt like several miles, (but was, in reality, only a few hundred feet), Mark expressed best, what we were all thinking:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Holy Mother Of God!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hid an ammo can to mark this auspicious occasion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As an indication of how much effort was expended in creating this hide, it took us 3 hours to get from the launch site to ground zero, but less than half an hour to get back. I don't know if it will be easier, or harder, as the water level drops.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This area is closed to the general public during hunting season, which takes up about 3 weeks each year, over various dates. You can find the hunting dates here: 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This location needs a cache just because of the historical
significance to New Smyrna Beach. It is a small lock 'n lock
box.&lt;br/&gt;
Should be open sunrise to sunset.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This virtual cache is about the characteristics/function of coastal sand dunes.

There is parking near the cache, but you have to pay to park. The parking fees are $4 Adults 16+, $2.50 Senior 65+, $1.50 Youth 6 to 15 years and under 6 free. The park hours are Standard Time: 6:00 AM—6:00 PM and Daylight Savings Time: 6:00 AM—9:00PM.

Hunting Island is a barrier island and serve a specific purpose in protecting the coast as well as providing a habitat and ecosystem in the tidal marshes for many animals and plants. The dunes on the sea side of the island also serve specific purposes. The dunes develop when winds blow in from the beach. The sand then accumulates around something that slows the wind, such as plants. 

Over time, a mound develops which slows the wind which helps create a larger mound. Sand continues to be added to the front (windward side) and removed from the back (leeward side). Plants growing in the dunes help stabilize the loss of sand. Dunes can develop in parallel rows perpendicular to the wind. Dunes farther from the beach are older and have a larger amount of vegetation growing on them. 

Logging requirement: You must answer the code phrase correctly using the following answers to these questions (i.e. answer 1 space answer 2):

1. Does the beach and dunes here on Hunting Island experience more or less erosion than other SC barrier islands? (Answer can be found on a sign nearby.)

2. What specific reptile depend on these dunes for survival? (Answer can be found on a sign nearby.)

Note: Please do not post the answers to these questions in your log.

Happy Hunting!

Inspired by other guardrail series in other counties, the Wholly G'rail caches are designed to be quick P&amp;G's for the busy cacher, because you know when you're on a long trip, you don't have a lot of time to stop and hunt.

I intentionally didn't number the caches in this series so other people could add some later without worrying about which number was next.

This Wholly G'rail is a magnetic key holder near the parking lot of a big home improvement store. There are some good places to eat in this shopping center, as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is no parking here. The best available parking is across WT Harris Blvd at Wallace Dr. To get to the Park you will need to cross Harris Blvd in &quot;Frogger&quot; style. Once at the site you will find a tool to aid in retrieval of the cache as well as coordinates for the final. 

Upon finding the final you will discover the second reason for the cache name. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Smoking Gun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;The year is 2011. It is a dark time for cachers across
the area. A killer is on the loose.&lt;br/&gt;His target? Creative geocache
hiders and those who seek them. It appears the&lt;br/&gt;killer is shooting
cachers just before they make the find as numerous cachers have&lt;br/&gt;
been shot, wounded or killed with the unsigned log in
hand…&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;*beep* … … … *beep* … …
… *beep* … … …&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A steady beep wakes you as quickly become aware of a sharp pain
in your shoulder and dull ache in your head. Your vision is blurry
but you can make out three people standing over you as your realize
you are laying in a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*beep* … … … *beep* … …
… *beep* … … …&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hear a woman's voice, “We have a steady pulse. I think
they’re starting to wake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As your eyes come into focus you see that you are laying in a
hospital bed with a nurse and two men in suits standing over you.
The taller man speaks with a polite tone, “We pardon the
abruptness but we have some urgent questions for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where am I?” you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shorter man speaks in a gruff tone, “You are in
hospital. You’ve been shot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You react in a panic, “Am I alright?? What
happened??”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurse quickly responds, “You’re fine. The bullet
appears to have gone straight through you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She then props you up with a pillow behind you and leaves the
room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short man quickly speaks again, “We need to know what
you were doing there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man speaks again as if he has been waiting on the short
man to finish, “We... we are just trying to piece together
the incident so we can locate the shooter. Once again, we apologize
for questioning you so soon but we need to gather the facts while
things are fresh in your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You rub your head as if deep in thought. “I don't quite
remember what happened. I was out geocaching with a group of other
cachers in north Charlotte. We had made a few finds in area. We
were looking for a particularly tough micro. I had just found it
and... and then I woke up here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short man nudges the other man in the arm and the tall man
leans over to whisper something in the other's ear. “Go
on,” says the short man in an abrupt and matter of fact
tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is all I remember.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interesting,” the short man concludes as the taller
man once again leans over and whispers in his ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man then turns to you and speaks in an exaggeratedly
slow manner, “We need to know who was with you. We think one
of the other geocachers might have been the one who shot you. Can
you please describe them to us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, there were nine of us. I didn’t know the
others too well. I am new to the group. We just met up to do some
caching on the north side of town since it has so little geocaching
activity but really great caches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short man’s brow furrows as he gives you a puzzled
look, “Can you describe the other cachers to us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man pulls out a note pad and pen and stands poised
ready to notate anything you say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, there was a quiet salt and peppered haired
gentleman who smelled of wet paint. He was very polite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there was a squirrelly looking fellow who looked
like he might have enjoyed crawling under houses or into
tunnels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a man in a suit and tie who stated he loved
beer but that he rarely ventured out of Mint Hill - especially
after being attacked by an assailant in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there was a gentleman who had an infatuation with
Sherlock Holmes stories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man speaks with a bit of a troubled tone, “We
know these men as Therapaint, TermiteHunter, Rvstauff and
David2400nc. Please continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there were two guys who said they worked nearby.
They were both very out of shape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short man grumbles, “That must have been
FailedApparatus and Puttzy. We have a file on those two. Was a
third guy with them - looked like he was nearly always covered in
thorn and briar scrapes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You nod as recall the man they are referring to and his little
red car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is SmithyPeaknuckle - a North Mecklenburg
geocacher,” the tall man explained politely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short man interrupts, “That makes seven and with you -
eight. I thought you said there were nine geocachers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man pauses from his notation and for the first time
gives you a stern look, “Yes, who was the ninth
geocacher?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think hard trying to remember who you had left out,
“There was a guy who kept to himself. He wore a shirt and tie
and dark sunglasses the whole time. I got the impression that he
was new to the group as well. He didn’t seem to know much
about the creative ways caches are hidden in the area and always
suggested we check under lamp post covers first. I thought this was
ironic since he stated his geocaching name was 'BrightIdeas'.
Another geocacher usually came up with the find nearby while he
spent time getting the lamp post cover back on straight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man leans over and speaks quickly to the short man in a
hushed tone before diverting his attention back to his notepad. The
short man nods and announces, “I think we’re done here.
We’ll be in touch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short man takes a business card from his pocket and places
it on the bedside table. The two men then turn and leave the room
just as a doctor enters. You look down to see a giant blood-soaked
bandage covering your left shoulder. Just as you run your hand over
the bandage you feel the pain return as the doctor speaks,
“You are lucky. The bullet missed your heart by about three
inches. The police just arrived and have a few questions for
you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A puzzled expression fills your face as two uniformed officers
enter the room. You look to the doctor as you quickly recall the
two men who were just questioning you. One of the officers speaks,
“Hello. We need to ask you a few routine questions. What is
this geocaching that you were doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were two men just here asking me questions!,”
you proclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, you remember the business card and pick it up off the
table beside you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card reads,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Bright Ideas - Lamp Post Cover Sales and
Distribution.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Shedding light on the importance of Lamp Post Covers
worldwide!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;p&gt;Released from the hospital a few hours later, you contemplate
what all has occurred. Your memory is still fuzzy but you are
determined to sign your name to that tricky cache you know you
found... somewhere. Retrace your steps to reveal the coordinates
for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At N 35° 20.731 W 080° 50.811, locate white lettering on the glass
nearby.&lt;br/&gt;
You'll know you are in the right spot when the cache name becomes
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = The number of letters in the top line in white minus 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = The number of letters in the 2nd line in white from the top
minus 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = The number of letters in the 3rd line in white from the top
minus 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = The number of letters in the 4th line in white from the top
minus 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = The number of letters in the 5th line in white from the top
minus 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = The number of letters in the bottom line in white minus
5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G = The number of letters in the 2nd line in white from the
bottom minus 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H = The number of letters in the 3rd line in white from the
bottom minus 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I = The number of letters in the 4th line in white from the
bottom minus 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J = The number of letters in the 5th line in white from the
bottom minus 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located within 15 feet of the solved coordinates.
You’ll just have to remember where.&lt;/p&gt;
Checksum: A+B+C+D+E=20, F+G+H+I+J=23&lt;br/&gt;

This film, which takes place in the Alaskan Wilderness, inspired a highly successful TV reality show of the same name in Brazil, where participants were selected from normal people, including executives, graduates and clerks, left in a wild and deserted area of Brazilian landscape and had to survive using techniques similar to the ones mentioned by one of the main characters.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the first cache in the new Crouching Tigers Movie (CTM)
series. We have noticed a general lack of caches in our area and
have decided to remedy this. The CTM series is going to be puzzle
caches that will range in difficulty from stupid easy to majorly

titles. Have fun fellow cachers and may the PAF be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case you haven't picked up on it yet, this movie may
have something to do with baseball. The name of this cache is a
adaptation of a popular (although mis-quoted) line from the movie.
The movie debuted in the late 80s and quickly gathered a following.
Critics were not as enamored, as the movie was eventually named one
of the &quot;20 Most Overrated Movies of All Time&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now given you all the clues you should need to figure
out which movie this cache is based on. Below are 4 options, one of
them being the correct movie. The coordinates next to the correct
movie is the actual location of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo'd lock-n-lock. Be confident in your
answer and patient with your GPS. (Tree cover tends to make it
bounce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is for the second movie of a very popular trilogy. We
recommend finding these caches in order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah But You Have Heard of Me&quot; contains the North coordinates for
&quot;How's Mum&quot;, and this cache contains the West coordinates for
&quot;How's Mum&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second movie in a blockbuster trilogy. It earned
$135,634,554 opening weekend breaking the record previously set by
Spiderman 2. Release prints of this movie were delivered to
theaters with the fake title &quot;Rummy 2&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The central figure in this movie is William Wilberforce
(1759-1833). He is a zealous believer in God, human rights activist
and British member of Parliament, who battled through
discouragement and illness for two decades to end the slave trade
in England. In a time of personal crisis, Wilberforce is inspired
and encouraged in his long fight to abolish slavery by the former
slave ship master, John Newton, who wrote a beloved hymn following
his conversion to Christianity. William helped found the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, his home was like an
animal sanctuary. In the movie he had cats, dogs, goats, horses,
lizards, porcupines, monkeys, and a VERY large rabbit.</groundspeak:long_description>

The area just begged for a cache, so we put out a container large enough to hold several travel bugs and geocoins.  Feel free to leave and take other things, too -- even travel bugs need toys from time to time.

This can be a hot spot during certain seasons, so watch for muggles.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is another cache in the Crouching Tigers Movie (CTM)
series. We have noticed a general lack of caches in our area and
have decided to remedy this. The CTM series is going to be
traditional, multi, and puzzle caches that will range in difficulty
from stupid easy to majorly hard. We will give you information or
clues about the movie -- stuff that we know and find rather
interesting. We expect this series to be never ending, as our
current movie collection has 476 titles. Have fun fellow cachers
and may the PAF be with you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache contains the North coordinates for &quot;How's Mum&quot;, and
&quot;Are You Afraid of Death&quot; contains the West coordinates for &quot;How's
Mum&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie has a star studded cast including one of our favorite
actors in a role that he will never leave behind. The movie was
released in July of 2003 and by December 2003 it had grossed almost
$306 million. Robert De Niro was originally approached to play of
one of the title roles, but declined because he felt that the movie
would not do well. He later went on the play a similar character in
another movie that ironically did not have nearly as much
acclaim.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

We have found where the Jolly Old Elf keeps his nice list, and we're going to let you in on the secret.  Normally, you have to be on your best behavior, but now you can add your name to the list directly!  So sign your name, and feel free to leave small toys for other cachers.

There is excellent parking and cover.  Flip-flops are NOT recommended.  Always beware of muggles, but be extra careful that Santa or the reindeer don't catch you!

This is disguised, so look carefully!  Cache does not contain a pen or pencil, so bring your own.  There is enough room for one or two TBs and small trade items.</groundspeak:long_description>

Was going to call this &quot;lake view&quot; but after caching today changed my mind.  Hard cache, easy cache, after finding one I seem to always ask &quot;WHY OH WHY&quot; (YOY) do I make it so hard on myself.  If it is up, I spend all my time looking down.  If it is in the front, will start in the back.  If hanging in a tree, will start in the bush.  YOY will I bushwhack when there is a trail?

Hopefully you will be asking YOY after finding this one.

Your looking for the allusive Silver Bison Tube.  Difficulty is for the beginners.  Experienced cachers should have an easy time of it. 

Need help?  post a Did Not Find and drop me a note. 

Most of all enjoy the cache</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend of the Fairy Stone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Many hundreds of years
before Chief Powhatan's reign, fairies were dancing around a spring
of water, playing with naiads and wood nymphs, when an elfin
messenger arrived from a city far away. He brought news of the
death of Christ. When these creatures of the forest heard the story
of the crucifixion, they wept. As their tears fell upon the earth,
they crystallized to form beautiful crosses. When the fairies
disappeared from the enchanted place, ground about the spring and
the adjacent valley was strewn with these mementos of the
event.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For many years people held
these little crosses in superstitious awe, firm in the belief that
they protected the wearer against witchcraft, sickness, accidents
and disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairy stones are
brown staurolite, a combination of SILICA, IRON and ALUMINUM (and
dots of real garnet). Together, these minerals crystallize in twin
form, accounting for the cross-like structure. Staurolite is only
found in rocks that have been subjected to intense
heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This earthcache is located in Fairy Stone
State park in Stuart, Virginia. Fairy Stone State Park is the
largest of Virginia's six original state parks and is home to its
namesake &quot;fairy stones.&quot; For more
information on the park, click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state_parks/documents/fairst.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The Earthcache is located in the &quot;stone hunting area&quot; of the park.
The parking area is on private property, but the land owners permit
parking for this purpose. The hunting area can include hills that
are quite steep. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIGGING IS STRICTLY
PROHIBITED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


To claim this cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the name of the business where you parked as the code phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Micro is placed at a
monument that honors my family heritage. It is placed in honor of
my Great Grandfather, Berman C. Snidow, and my Grandmother, Kay
Snidow Sowers. Both of them had a
profound effect on my life. My Great Grandfather lived to be 106,
and he
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sowersnet.com/genealogy/BC_Snidow.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;told a much
     &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sowersnet.com/genealogy/kss.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; embellished version
     of the facts on the monument. Whenever any family member came
     to visit, he ALWAYS looked at them and said &quot;Where'd you come
     from?&quot; My Grandmother instilled in me the importance of
     knowing my lineage and keeping this information for
     future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is limited parking at
the site, but parking is plentiful at the surrounding businesses.
The monument can be seen from US Rt. 460.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is being
maintained by my father, known to the geocaching community as
Ham_N_Aches.&lt;/p&gt;

I quickly spotted many interesting locations for a cache; I brought Fredhead and Queenie-Boo-Bay back to have a look they loved the spot, and soon agreed on a suitable location.

The adventure begins as you start to look for the cache, the roads are winding and hilly, you will go up and down, side to side but you will enjoy the ride. The scenery is great as you make your way to this cache just do not plan to do it fast. We think you will enjoy this hide, as much as we enjoyed making it, we hope you enjoy it.

If you are careful you may not get wet, but do not count on it.

Please replace the cache as found, this location looks as if it might have flooded in the past, and as stashed it should survive for many years to come, high water or not.

We headed out before early enough to reach the cache and return to the car before the rain started. It was a slippery, mudfest walking to and from the cache (everything was melting), but we did not care. Dad did the honors of retrieving the cache, and the girls dug thru the loot (I don't know how you manage to cram so much goodies into that box!). They made some festive trades before dad rehid it. This cache definately hit the spot today! THANKS!</groundspeak:text>

Seems like the caching sprits have been trying to stop us from going out lately. It did not look like it was raining thru my windows today, so I loaded up Heather &amp; we headed out. I needed a pick-me-up, and this cache promised merriment! As soon as I pulled out of the garage, I realized that it was misting a bit. Oh well, maybe it would stop. Very nice park and walking trail. I made quick work out of the first stage, and down the trail we went. No trouble finding the final...Heather was absolutely THRILLED to pull out a Scooby Doo toy from the cache. We traded TBs and headed back to the car, just a little more damp than when we got there (the misting never stopped). No &quot;merry men&quot; (women or children) in the park today, but we left merrier. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So today is our geocaching 1 yr anniversary and mommy and the lil ruts weren't going to let the rain stop us from fiding a cache, so out we went.  Found the park rather easily and headed on out trek.  We found stage one, but mommy had to retrieve it because of the prickers gaurding it.  We quickly solved the puzzle and continued on the trail.  Of course we had to stop to play for a few on the really cool playground, but then we continued on to the cache.  Lil C was basically standing on the cache saying &quot;it has to be here somewhere&quot; as mommy touched something and uncovered it to laughter from the lil ruts.  We made our trades and continued to the car.  Thanks for the nice walk in such a great little park.  It is a lot bigger than i thought it was going to be and the walking trail was quite enjoyable.

of the cache can be found so that you don't get caught in the

park in Upper St. Clair! This is a 29oz clear Lock 'n Lock
container that contains information for the puzzle cache 
OXRGCV ~ 'Owney'.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are small trades in the cache and a log book that needs to
be signed to earn your smilie. Please be careful when retrieving
this cache. The terrain rating is for the last 50' and can be very
muddy. Of course, there might be an easier way to go, but we will
let you decide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hay's Park has 1 basketball court (no lights), 1 tennis court
(no lights) and Playground Equipment (in wood chips) that includes
1 swing set, red cement climber, 1 play structure with small slide
and tire swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park also has several other miscellaneous items such as an
asphalt walking trail, a spraypool, a small shelter, a water
fountain, a grass multi-purpose area, perimeter lighting and a
barbecue grill. There are a few parking spaces as well off the side
of Hays Road.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This micro cache is located in Wiltshire park. The park is located in the township of Upper St. Clair on McMurray Rd. There is a small parking lot located on Wiltshire Dr. at N40 19.404 W080 04.143. 

This is just your basic south hills micro cache with a twist (or
two). One twist is that it holds the information to unlock the
puzzle cache

OXRGCV ~ 'Owney'.

 
Please bring a writing utensil to sign the log for your smilie.
It might also be a good idea to bring some paper so that you can
write down the information that will be given for the puzzle. In
this cache you might also find a tool that you might need for the
puzzle.
If there are any, please only take one, but please do not leave anything in
its place.


Although trades will not fit in with the log sheet and tools,
there is a possibility that micro sized TBs and very small trades
could be left (if they are weatherproof).

Please remember to place it back just as you found it!  Also, bring a garbage bag out with you and CITO a little if you want!!  
Good luck and happy caching!

&lt;br/&gt;
Please park on the street,but be sure not to block the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In order to find this cache you must first find the three traditional caches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OX25CG7
~ Ichi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OX1CW8R
~ Ni&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OXRGD0
~ San&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 3 caches will have the needed coordinates and a tool required to log this puzzle cache. Once you have the tool and needed information from those three, and have solved the following logic puzzle, you can then make your way toward the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The cache is located at : &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;N40 19.ABX W080 04.CYZ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the values of A,B,C,X,Y and Z in the three traditional caches. Having just the coordinates will not be sufficient enough to be able to sign the logbook. You must also solve the following logic puzzle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOGIC PUZZLE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; With a field of five for the south hills marathon race,
there was little to no interest from the local gamblers. In order
to spark some interest in the event and earn some money, the local
bookie decided to open the books to multiple bets at high odds. In
order to place a multiple bet, you must bet on two propositions.
You will win only if both propositions turn out to be true.
Unfortunately, these 5 bets were not winning bets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    1) Frank Graham will not win the gold, nor
Billy Casker the silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    2) Edith Forge will win a medal, and Jack
Angel will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    3) Jack Angel and Darla Edwards will both win
medals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    4) Jack Angel will not win the silver, nor
Darla Edwards the bronze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    5) Frank Graham will win a medal, and Edith
Forge will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, who won each of the medals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Give your answers in initials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                Gold
 ___. ___.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                Silver
___. ___.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                Bronze
___. ___.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now that you have solved the logic problem and you have the coordinates, make your way to the cache site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The cache is placed on private property with permission, so please be respectful. Leave everything just as you found it. If you see the owner, feel free to say hello! Good luck and happy caching! Note: as always, the log book must be signed to earn that smilie.&lt;/p&gt;

We also learned 2 things from this experience...be thorough and a chunk of ice is NOT a good snowball (sorry Dennie!). Learned some other stuff, too, but don't want to give anything away for the next folks. Took 2 TBs (Brenda has been wanting that bowling pin since the event), left 2 TBs &amp; duckie.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There is nothing hidden at the given coordinates! They are the
starting point for this night time cache. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be very hard to impossible to locate during daylight. You will need a flashlight to find the 18 reflectors to find the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The park closes at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Light versus Dark is one story that everyone
thinks they know. The light represents the good; the Dark
represents the bad, however, this is too broad of a statement. Not
all of those who follow the Light can be considered &quot;good,&quot; and
many “good” people do indeed follow the Dark, you may even know a
few yourself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beneath all of the apparent issues, the Light
and the Dark are very simple. It simply has to do with one's
personal point of view. An individual who sees the world as a bad
place, one who sees nothing good anywhere and who projects that
there is no hope of anything better is someone that has a &quot;dark&quot;
mind. These people are not necessarily followers of the Dark, but
they form the basis of that particular orientation. On the other
hand, an individual who has a positive outlook on life and tries to
find the good in everything and often tries to point out that the
world is not as bad as people think are those who are of the Light.
Neither one of these ways of thinking is necessarily right or
wrong. Both can make good arguments for their points of view, which
is where the problem lies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Over the years, all of the conflicts that have
taken place have somehow been in the form of Light against Dark.
People who had extreme opinions on either side would spark up the
problems. Once the problems had begun, other people, who normally
would have been more in the middle, would choose one side or the
other based on their opinions at that moment in time. Feuds and
animosity would then develop. This is how the problem began. The
designations of &quot;Light&quot; and &quot;Dark&quot; started to be used to
differentiate between the two sides for &quot;good and evil&quot; This was
not appropriate, neither side was good or evil so to speak. Now,
keep in mind, it is true that too much light can do as much or more
harm than too much darkness, and, wherever you find one, the other
must surely exist. They are opposites, like north and south, and
there will never be one without the other. They must coexist in
order to balance each other out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a night time only cache, although, if you really wish to try it during the day, feel free to give it a shot. The page coordinates will take you to the starting place for the cache. You WILL NEED a FLASHLIGHT. In fact, I suggest bringing a spare or
extra batteries as this cache may take more than an hour to complete. &lt;i&gt;The park closes at midnight&lt;/i&gt;, so please plan your trip accordingly. You can find parking on the road to the Lebanon Pavillion, across 100 acre drive in the big lot or near the Silent Brook Barn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you arrive at the posted coordinates, use your flashlight to spot the first reflector, which will be north of your position. Once you spot it proceed to it's location, and begin scanning for the next. Some are farther apart than others and may be hard to see with out moving around. I tried to limit the amount of movement but you still will need to encompass about a 10' radius of the current reflector. In all you will visit 16 places with reflectors, with the third stage and the final having two reflectors. When you are standing in between the final 2 reflectors the cache container is approximately 35' at 270 degrees TN. This is where your geosenses will come into play and help you find the Ammo can, which is larger than a .50 cal can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall terrain is not too hard, but I added a half star to a star since it will be night. There are easy ways to get to each reflector, which is not always the most direct way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache does contain 2 prizes - one for the FTF and one for the 2TF. Please take only one of them. They are in the bag with the logbook. In addition to the prizes, there are a lot of trades in the can and they all follow a light theme somehow. There are flashlights, glowsticks, glow in the dark stickers, and a lot of other neat light up objects. Please try to stay on theme when making trades and as always, please sign the logbook with a little bit about your journey to earn that smilie.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FTF honors go to Lindsychris followed closely by Princess
Lisa as 2TF. WTG!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well...we started this one a few of weeks ago. We dragged the kids from reflector to reflector. I am sure that we missed a few along the way, but we made it pretty far. Unfortunately, once we got so far, the kids were too tired to continue. Just as we were about ready to go home, Brian  saw the double reflectors...but wait...the reflectors were moving a little bit. Hey...that's not part of the cache! I was a deer caught in the light of our flashlight. Our hopes crushed, we headed home, and emailed the cache owner to find out how much further we had to go (we were at #13 when the family quit...figures!). Luckily, I thought that I caught another reflector (turns out it was one of the doubles) on the way out, so we went back to this spot, and it was a reflector. We never found the other, but since we knew that we were at the end, we didn't even look for it...just the cache. The kids were thrilled with their goods. We left a flashlight &amp; light-up toy, and took home a sword &amp; some glow-in-the-dark bats. Also snagged the eyeball TB. TFTC! </groundspeak:text>

I was just finishing my vacation and decided to top it off with this cache on an excellent day. I packed up the gear and headed to the cache. I made an error in calculations and contacted the CO and was informed of my error. The cache was safe and sound as well as me. What a view, I must add this cache as one of my all time favorites thus far. TFTC and the awesome adventure.</groundspeak:text>

located just off of route 19. This cache is a micro. Please be sure
to put it back properly. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On September 8, 1994, ten members of the Upper St. Clair Community
perished on Flight 427 when it crashed in Hopewell Township near
Pittsburgh International Airport. In friendship and support for the
families and friends in our community, the Township of Upper St.
Clair constructed a permanent memorial garden with the hope that a
lasting memorial will comfort the families and honor the deceased.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The groundbreaking ceremony for the garden was held on November 9,
1994. The garden was designed to be a peaceful area along
McLaughlin Run Creek, near the Township Municipal Building. The
memorial garden includes benches, shade trees, perennial beds,
Nordic holly, rhododendrons and a walkway. Please respect the
environment. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will not have to leave the concrete pathway to find this cache.
The cache contains only a log sheet as there is no room for
anything else. Please bring a writing utensil to sign the log and
then gingerly replace the container where you found it. The cache
has been labeled handicapped accessible, however the container may
not be retrievable without assistance.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks and good luck hunting! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Note: As always, sign the logsheet for a smilie! Also, please do
not post spoilers in your online log. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
FTF honors went to roygpa with Ruffledostrich coming in a
very close second!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
update: October 2007- the container has been fixed and
there should not be anymore moisture issues. Please make sure the
lid is secure. Thanks and happy hunting!

coordinates to the KKCK puzzle cache if you so choose.***
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hi, my name is Kerry and this cache is part of the Kerry,
Karey, Carrie, Kerry puzzle cache. We are all members of PAGA and
have been talking for a few months about each placing a cache that
would contain a clue for a 5th cache. We all live in different
areas, so getting our 4 caches, plus the final puzzle, may take
several trips.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Keeping that in mind, my cache is located in Upper St.
Clair and you can make a day of caching in this area while
collecting my part of the puzzle.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is an .50 cal ammo can that started with a bunch
of books and a few other trinkets. Feel free to trade a book if you
would like or even borrow one and return when you are done reading
it. Also included with the logbook is a FTF prize containing some
geocaching things.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To start this search, park at the suggested coords, cross
the bridge and head up behind the batting cages. It may appear that
there is parking closer, but the cache is not accessible from that
parking!!! NOTE THE TERRAIN RATING!! There is no need to go wading
up to your knees in water! Please be safe and enjoy your walk. When
this was placed, there was another cache along the route:
Geocaching 101- Grade 1. If you haven't found it yet, this would be
a great time!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The terrain might be a bit tricky...wouldn't suggest doing
this in a mini skirt wearing flip-flops, but to each his own. There
are some steep spots and on a wet day it could be slippery. Be very
careful. From the parking the cache is less than a quarter of a
mile.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

terrain raised from 2-3 after reading alanfreed's log. In
the growth months this is a nice bushwhack and if you take a wrong
step, you could find yourself going down a big hill! Have
fun!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;USC Rec building parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 20.102 W 080° 04.433&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kerry's Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 20.070 W 080° 04.440&lt;br/&gt;Enter the woods here...you might want some bug spray in the warmer months!</groundspeak:long_description>

The Outdoor Classroom Parking N 40° 20.162 W 080° 06.314  

The Outdoor Classroom is an educational facility nestled within 475 acres of Boyce Mayview Park just 12 miles south of downtown Pittsburgh. The Outdoor Classroom offers something for everyone, including programs for teachers, students, service groups, government officials, business leaders, and community residents. Visit their website to find out more!  

This cache was placed by PAGA in conjunction with The Outdoor Classroom to recognize our newly formed alliance and our first collaborative event in October, 2011. It is a short walk from parking and can be found alone or as the start of a great day of caching in the park.

The container was created by thebuddhaman and given to renruts who needed a good place to hide it. They thought this would be the perfect place. It is a small cylindrical tupperware container that has a logbook and some trade items to start.

To get to the cache, enter Boyce-Mayview at the Community and Recreation Center entrance on Mayview Road and veer to the left to travel towards the Parking Coordinates. You can then walk towards the classroom and take a right around the trees. At times there might be a slight water hazard to cross, but, regardless of water, you will have to go down a slight incline and up the other side. Please be gentle with the cache and remember to hide it exactly as you found it. We hope you find this to be a fun cache!

park can be full at times...might want to rethink looking if a game
is going on! There are 2 parking areas for this park- the main one
appears closed most of the time. The other area is closer to the
cache area and the ball field and there is a bridge right into the
park!! Be careful...there might be muggles, but if all else fails,
tell them what you are doing and educate a muggle.
 Inside the lid you will find the
information needed for Owney and in the container you will find a
bunch of signature items that we have collected over the years.
Please feel free to trade and leave your own if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring a writing utensil so that you can sign the logsheet
to earn your smilie. In addition, it might be a good idea to bring
some paper so that you can write down the information that will be
given for the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be cautious when retrieving it and please place it back
just as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unscratched lotto ticket for the FTF...please let us
know if it was a big winner!!
&lt;/p&gt;
Good luck and happy caching!




Congratulations PrincessTiki on your FFTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Dirty Caches Job 1, Bower Hill Volunteer Fire Department, is the
first cache placed in a series of caches we hope to place based on
a theme from Discovery Channel's &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; hosted by Mike
Rowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is slightly larger than a normal bison tube and was
placed with permission of Bower Hill Volunteer Fire Department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plan for this series of caches is to exemplify the same
attributes as the show, and as thus the premise for each cache will
follow the theme of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with the show, the theme quoted
directly from Discovery's website is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to Dirty Jobs, the new Discovery Channel
series that profiles the unsung American laborers who make their
living in the most unthinkable — yet vital — ways.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Our brave host and apprentice Mike Rowe will introduce
you to a hardworking group of men and women who overcome fear,
danger and sometimes stench and overall ickiness to accomplish
their daily tasks.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further information on the program, feel free to visit
the
Dirty Jobs Website&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How does B.H.V.F.D. Station 255 fit in the grand scheme of the
theme?&lt;br/&gt;
Well, here is a short synopsis from &quot;Life of a Fireman&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could see the sadness of a business man as his
livelihood goes up in flames, or that family returning home, only
to find their house and belongings damaged or lost for
good.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could see what it is like to search a burning
bedroom for trapped children, flames rolling above your head, your
palms and knees burning as you crawl, the floor sagging under your
weight as the kitchen below you burns.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could comprehend a wife's horror at 3 am as the
Fireman checked her husband of 40 years for a pulse and find none.
They start CPR anyway, hoping to bring him back, knowing
intuitively it is to late. But wanting his wife and family to know
everything possible was done too try to save his life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you knew the unique smell of burning insulation, the
taste of soot - filled mucus, the feeling of intense heat through
your turnout gear, the sound of flames crackling, the eeriness of
being able to see absolutely nothing in dense smoke - sensations
that Firemen become too familiar with.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could understand how it feels to go to work in the
morning after having spent most of the night, hot and soaking wet
at a multiple alarm fire, or spending the night running on EMS
calls for people who are in need of help and assistance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could realize the physical, emotional and mental
drain or missed meals, lost sleep and forgone social activities, in
addition to all the tragedy seen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could know the brotherhood and self - satisfaction
of helping save a life or preserving someones property, or being
able to be there in time of crisis, or creating order from total
chaos.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish you could understand what it feels like to have a
little boy tugging at your arm and asking, &quot; Is Mommy okay? &quot; and
not even being able to look in his eyes without tears from your own
and not knowing what to say. Or you to have to hold back a long
time friend who watches his buddy having rescue breathing done on
him as they take him away in the ambulance. You know all along he
did not have his seat belt on. Another sensation that Firemen have
become too familiar with.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And finally I wish you could understand what it is like to go
on a call, and to find out that a child has shot another child, and
to pull out every trick in your book to save the child from death
but you lose in the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have lived with this kind of life, you will never
truly understand or appreciate who a Fireman is or what their job
really means to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Have fun with the cache. Please be respectful of the area, and
park in a designated space. There may be parties or receptions in
the hall at times, although you should be able to find the cache as
long as you are comfortable hunting it with out disturbing the
occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks go out to Bower Hill V.F.D. Station 255 for their
co-operation in placing this cache and the volunteers for their
dedication and commitment to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a 2006 Micro Mini Geocoin and a GeoCoin Club Pathtag in
the cache for FTF and STF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FTF honors went to Lindsychris and STF honors went to The
Chihuahua Cacher!&lt;/p&gt;

The cache site overlooks a 'sleeping giant', what was once the lifeblood of the Upper Ohio Valley. It was one of the world's leading steel producers and eventually the world's largest employee owned (ESOP) company. Now it lies (nearly) dormant...a sad reminder of what we've let slip out of our country. Hope you enjoy the view - (reminiscent of 'Reckless' (the movie), probably the best view of the sleeping giant, which will rise again some day).

Be discrete, there may be muggles around (though not that common for others to walk the path). Parking at 40° 24.824 / 80° 841.</groundspeak:long_description>

After waiting about 3 hours I stopped by the cache location and was presented with an interesting situation. The entire parking lot was closed off for repaving. I proceeded to park on the side road and blazed a path to the cache. TFTC and the FTF again. Sorry I keep getting these before anyone, I like others to have a chance for them.</groundspeak:text>

If you are an early finder there are a couple of nickels and several pennies that were custom smashed by the Indiana Railroad in southern Indiana (state).  No need to trade for a smashed coin.  Take one.  This area is highly visible but I don't think people are going be eager to run up and see what you are/were up to (muggle).

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache is a milestone for tweetybugs. It is our 100th logsplitter1 find. We give much thanks to logsplitter1 for all the  time and effort he puts into hiding caches. We have really enjoyed finding every one and look forward to another 100. If we could just start finding them as fast as he hides them we might be able to catch up a little but thats a tall order. We spotted this blue beauty just hanging out where the coords took us and signed it quick. Thanks again logsplitter1 and GeoPiper too! TFTC's!!! SLWBP.</groundspeak:text>

 Tucked into steep-sided valleys along the Ohio River and spanning the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border, the 130-acre &quot;Little Blue Run&quot; lake was opened in 1975 to store coal-combustion waste from the 2,490-megawatt Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in Shippingport, 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The power plant burns 7 million tons of coal annually and is connected to Little Blue by a seven-mile underground pipe that carries 625,000 tons of fly ash and bottom ash to the reservoir each year.
Little Blue is one of seven permitted coal ash disposal reservoirs in the state but the only one in the southwestern region.
The reservoir was scheduled to close in 2008. But after getting state approval in 2006 to make the impoundment up to 62 feet higher by stacking coal ash behind small dikes built on top of already solidified ash, its closing date was pushed back until 2031 or beyond.</groundspeak:long_description>

Congratulations to &quot;FreundFamily&quot; on the FTF!!! 

 Tucked into steep-sided valleys along the Ohio River and spanning the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border, the 130-acre &quot;Little Blue Run&quot; lake was opened in 1975 to store coal-combustion waste from the 2,490-megawatt Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in Shippingport, 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The power plant burns 7 million tons of coal annually and is connected to Little Blue by a seven-mile underground pipe that carries 625,000 tons of fly ash and bottom ash to the reservoir each year.
Little Blue is one of seven permitted coal ash disposal reservoirs in the state but the only one in the southwestern region.
The reservoir was scheduled to close in 2008. But after getting state approval in 2006 to make the impoundment up to 62 feet higher by stacking coal ash behind small dikes built on top of already solidified ash, its closing date was pushed back until 2031 or beyond.</groundspeak:long_description>

 There is a pull off near the cache. BE CAREFUL as this road is rough, has NO winter maintenance, and the locals travel faster than they should sometimes.

It is a shame that so many dump garbage along these back roads.

 There is a pull off near the cache. BE CAREFUL as this road is rough, has NO winter maintenance, and the locals travel faster than they should sometimes.

It is a shame that so many dump garbage along these back roads.

Ever think up the perfect name for a spot?  We have been tempted to erect a sign at locations like this around the city, but we decided that a geocache would be a much more legally appropriate way to name the spot.

Extreme stealth required at some times of day.  Please make sure the lid snaps when you've signed it.  Micro - bring your own pen, or avoid if you're a trigo-micro-hater.

We recommend using the parking coordinates below and not parking on Warrendale-Bayne Rd./The Red Belt, or I-79.

Happy geocaching and enjoy the view!

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We drive down this road often to visit with family, and the
tree/bush at GZ has aways had my attention for a cache. So here it
is...The container is a clear rubbermaid container, which will hold
small swag and trade items.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The bench mark is just given as a fun starting point but will give
you no assistance in finding the container location.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I've changed this one to a 35mm on a rope, hiden along a trail
that parallels the Connoquenessing Creek in Harmony. Considering
the name this one should give be a dead giveaway put the GPS away
and enjoy the walk along this nice trail. Please replace as hidden
or atleast in a way it cannot easily be seen from the
trail.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is an ammo can located along a trail that runs past the
Mennonite Meetinghouse, a Cemetery and Connoquenessing Creek. This
should be a pretty easy find, just keep an eye out for poison ivy
and muggles. It's located pretty close to the trail so it will be
hard to hide when grabbing your treasure.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Mennonite Meetinghouse pictured is where Harmony's
Mennonites built their stone meetinghouse back in 1825, and right
next to a cemetery. It is said to be the oldest Mennonite
meetinghouse west of the Alleghenies, so enjoy a little bit of
history while in he area.&lt;/b&gt;

Not too far from an intersection however cache is hidden in a wet area. There is some heavy brush that you must get through. Both terrain and difficuly change with the seasons. Difficulty becomes a 1 when it is warmer. I do not have any idea what may happen to the terrain come spring. Log and a few small trade items - you MUST supply your own pen or pencil.&lt;b&gt; ***STRONGLY recomend high, waterproof boots***&lt;/b&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

There used to be a multi here in this park, but the owner shut it down. So, we decided that this would be a great place to do our first!

This is only a dawn to dusk. No motorized vehicles beyond the parking area. Definitely not wheelchair accessible unless it can go off road, but the park itself is. The path from the parking area is paved, but you need to leave the path to get to the cache site. During heavy leaf cover your GPSr may/will jump.

DO NOT stop on the interstate.
Use the Sagertown exit.



There is no need to cross the guardrail along the road
and no need to go up the small hill toward the highway... SO
DON'T.

A simple micro hidden in the normal fashion please BYOP.This hide is NOT at the dry hyrdant so please do not mess with it or look around it. 
Having water available in area streams, ponds and cisterns helps a fire department only if the water is readily accessible. The needed water may be located so far away from where it is needed that a fire department's ability to control the fire is impaired. Mobile water supply vehicles can move water from distant sources, but the critical factor is whether or not the fire department can maintain an uninterrupted supply of a predictable rate of water at the fire scene.

Installation of dry hydrants into nearby and developed water supplies eliminates the inefficiency and complexity of long-distance water shuttle operations. This arrangement also allows access to water sources from a roadway instead of having to work on soft ground immediately adjacent to the pond or stream.

In any area without water mains and domestic fire hydrants, the dry hydrant concept can provide a simple, cost-effective solution to the need for rapid access to water sources. A dry hydrant consists of an arrangement of piping with one end in the water and the other end extending to dry land and available for connection to a pumper.

Dry hydrants have the following features:

•Use a non-pressurized pipe system.
•Use relatively inexpensive piping materials and other supplies.
•Are permanently installed in existing lakes, ponds, streams and cisterns.
•Provide a means of access whenever needed, regardless of weather.
•Allow years of simple operation with a minimum of maintenance.

It eased up quite a bit when we found the entrance to the cemetery but started up again once we got close to the cache.  Mrs.uccacher spotted it from the road and I drove right up to it.  Just like fireref, we had to use something to coax it out of it's hiding spot.  Luckily I had my multi-tool which did the trick.  It looks like there are now about 3 residents here.

This is a simple micro hidden in the &quot;normal fashion&quot;. However the Terrain is bumped up slightly since you have to cross over a drainage ditch along the road. 

There is a new housing development going in across the road, you may safely park there. </groundspeak:long_description>

This one was quite a long drive from the last one but it was nice to cool off after doing a couple of short hiking caches.  Mrs.uccacher told me where to look and watched from the cool comfort of the Jeep while I retrieved it.  I guess the deer must have decomposed since it didn't stink here anymore.  On the way to the next cache it started to pour and the poor people on their loud motorcycles with no helmets looked like they were really suffering.  At least I couldn't hear the roar of their illegal exhausts over the pounding of the rain.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I mixed this one up with #4 since the names and descriptions aren't very descriptive on the first hides in this series.  #4 was buried too deep so I didn't even get out to look.

During there drive they got to this corner and my friend didnt see the STOP sign. He was hit by an SUV on the driver side of his van at 70+ mph. 3 boys and the little girl were ejected from the van. The 2 boys died instantly. Sal JR. was 13 and Anthony was 8. The little girl was thrown into the nearby woods and only suffered a small cut. It has been almost 3 years, but it still seems like yesterday. This is a memorial cache for those 2 boys. When you go to this cache please look at those 2 lonley crosses and think how short life can actually be.

A Travel Bug &amp; Geocoin Hotel just off the I-90 Peach St Exit. The container is Lock-n-Lock equal to the size of 2 .50 ammo boxes.

Just a little place for weary TBs, Pathtags &amp; Coins to rest a spell while trying to make it to their requested destinations.

There is no need to go BEYOND the posted no trespassing signs &amp;/or to the retention ponds.

The cache is placed with permission of the business nearby. It is asked that ALL CACHERS DO NOT go near the retention ponds, harrass, harm or attempt to lure the wildlife in the area. There is no need to go beyond the platform at all. As long as this is adhered to the cache can &amp; will stay active.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After running to the Millcreek Mall for the second day in a row (I really don't like going there once a year let alone two days in a row), I decided that it was time to get this cache off of my first page of unfound caches.  I didn't have my GPSr with me but I did have my iPhone.  Then again, I didn't need that either because I'd been here before for Kiawa's cache.  The snow was about knee deep at the edge of the road and in the dip, but that didn't stop me.  Found the goose first and then moved to the other side and found the cache.  Took a Green Jeep that hadn't been logged in to the cache and hadn't been logged in almost three years.  All of the other bugs/coins are there except for the Yellow Jeep.  That was the main reason I stopped.  Oh well.  I got a green one.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU PARK FOR THIS CACHE, THIS IS WHY I ADDED THE DANGEROUS AREA ATTRIBUTE TO THE PAGE. 


Another micro hidden in the somewhat normal fashion and to help boost a cacher's numbers.

Please BYOP 
DO NOT stop on the
interstate.





There is no need to cross the fence along the
road

and no need to go down the hill toward the highway... SO

DON'T.

Tonight Mrs.uccacher and I were at the Union City Community Foundation tent at Liberty Park for the first Eight Great Tuesdays concert and since things were hectic at work, I still needed my cache for the day.  Muggles be damned this time I told myself.  There were only 5 girls and a gnarly looking older guy sitting at the bus stop this time.

After checking the spot that the hint seems to refer to and finding nothing, I called a lifeline and he told me I was looking in the wrong spot. Where I was looking first probably would have been a better spot since where it's hidden is in full sight of the muggles waiting for the bus.  I made the grab and took the container back to the Jeep to sign the log.  The girl muggles left and Mrs.uccacher made a comment about pimp and hookers.  She's so mean.

We could have sat there all night waiting to replace the container but I said the heck with it and put it back.  I didn't hear anything on the news about the Erie bomb squad blowing anything up so I guess no one noticed.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

We met up with DnF and added one of the team to our group and had a nice cache train going, LOL. We met up early in the morning to grab some caches along the route to our destination. We made pretty quick work of this one and got back in the car and on our way. TNLNSL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The posted co-ordinates are for the parking area. You really
want to park here since you need some nearby information. The
actual cache location is determined after you visit a series of
virtual caches to arrive at the final co-ordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my Mother (Eunice) out geocaching about a month before I
placed this cache and she really had fun with it. So, for my first
cache placement, I decided to do it near her home in Tillsonburg.
This is now her little secret - a Tupperware container that started
with the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log book and Pencil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Tim Horton's Gift Certificate for the First Finder. Use it at
N42° 51.584' W80° 43.366'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A disposable camera. Naturally this is for you to take a
picture of your geocaching team. I'll develop the film and post the
photos once the camera is full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A kaleidoscope lens toy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A LED keychain light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 
Mocha's Goldfish Travelbug&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located along a stretch of the Trans Canada Trail
as it meanders through the heart of the town that Tobacco built.
Since the trend away from cigarettes, the area has become a major
Ginseng producer, but you'll still find plenty of tobacco fields
outside town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All co-ordinates start with N42° and W80° so we're going to skip
those digits for the math, and we'll do away with that pesky
decimal till the end of each calculation too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get out of your car, look around. If you've parked at
the posted co-ordinates, you should see a vehicle that won't be
moving anywhere soon.&lt;br/&gt;
 This vehicle has a couple buildings nearby that would be related
to it if it could move. Inside those buildings you can go in and
learn about the history of Tillsonburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a note of the number printed on the side of this vehicle
(digits only, we don't care about the alphabetic characters). We'll
call this number &quot;A&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate stage two, perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;


North Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ __ (A)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Add 33679&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 N42° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

West Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ __ (A)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Add 26053&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 Transfer to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 W 80° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. As an error check, the next stage is within
600M of the Parking Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short walk, you should find yourself within a few feet
of a sign that has an animal on it. Look for a number at the bottom
right corner of this sign. We'll call this number &quot;B&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate stage three, perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the digits that make up &quot;B&quot; and add them together to
produce &quot;C&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


North Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ (B)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Multiply by&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;= __ __ __ __ __&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 N42° __ __ . __ __ __'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

West Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 __ __ __ __ __ (D)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Subtract 2227&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Transfer to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 W 80° __ __ . __ __ __'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Three&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stage three there are no numbers printed to write down.
Instead you're counting. At the location you calculated in Stage
Two, there is a structure. Simply count the number of supports this
structure has (at contact with the ground), and assign that to
&quot;E&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the location of the final, here's the math to stop you
from cheating, we're going to use a number from Stage Two in the
calculation.&lt;/p&gt;


North Co-ordinate

&lt;p&gt;__ __ (E)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Multiply by B&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &quot;F&quot; = __ __ __ __ __&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Add 7932&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 = __ __ __ __ __&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfer to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 N42° __ __ . __ __ __'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__ __ __ __ __ (F)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 Transfer to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 W 80° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it! Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

St. Paul's Anglican church is quite fascinating, as it is one of the few wooden Anglican churches in the world.

Wooden Anglican churches in Ontario of the second half of the 19th century are not plentiful. In the first place, rich, large and/or more ambitious congregations opted to build their churches in stone or brick rather than wood because a masonry edifice was seen to be more permanent. Secondly, wooden edifices were more susceptible to destruction by fire. 

The survival of St Paul's Anglican Church in the village of Middleport is therefore quite remarkable. The History of Brant County published in 1883, records that St Paul's was 'erected during the year of 1868, on an eligible plot of ground, the gift of Robert Wade, Esq.'. The church is described as 'A neat frame building with tower and bell, its value being $1,500'. St Paul's was consecrated in 1880 by Isaac Hellmuth (1817-1901), Bishop of Huron (1871-1883).

The church history informs us that St Paul's was erected 'under the direction of Reverend Adam Elliott' but the name of the architect is not recorded. Be that as it may, it is clear that the person was well informed about ecclesiological principles of Anglican Church design.

The church also backs onto the Grand River, and this is a great spot to take pics from. The cache is a small sized jar with a screw top lid, with logbook, swag and pen. Please leave the logbook and pen in the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small cemetery located along Highway 54 in Tuscarora Township, not far from Chiefswood Rd. It is named for the Jamieson Family, a very predominant name in the area, particularly on the Six Nations reserve.

This small cemetery hosts 20 monuments, 19 of which have the last name Jamieson on them, 8 of which are part of a family plot in the centre of the burial ground.

In order to access the cache, there is no need to enter the cemetery. There is a short trail (about 10m) straight past the cache. 

Parking is available on the side of Highway 54, although if your vehicle is much larger than mine, you will want to park on the NORTH side of 54 in the small parking lot. Please take care in crossing the road as cars do tend to speed down this stretch. Also please be careful as ticks are VERY prominent this year.

Cache is a regular sized lock and lock container, camo-taped and then hidden. Please rehide as well as or better than you found it. Even thought there is a pen in the cache, I always suggest bringing one, just in case (especially in winter when pens tend to freeze).</groundspeak:long_description>

In the spring, this is a great place to catch a few fish. Every Sunday afternoon during the summer, you can expect to find between 10-15 horses and riders wandering through here, taking in the sights. Its a great place to see deer and other wildlife.

The cache is a regular sized lock'n'lock container filled with log book, pen and swag. Please feel free to trade but remember, if you take something, leave something of equal or greater value.

Well, I am having one of those weeks. 


And so, today to try and clear my head I went for a nice long walk by the river, placing a few caches while I was out. It's really amazing how much better you feel after a nice long walk. 
I happeed to have a few cache containers in the car, so I placed them out along the trail. It's a lovely trail I'd never been down before, so hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did.

These are nothing particularly special... log book, pen and some swag in tupperware.
This paricular tree caught my eye due to its size and shape. I just thought it looked cool.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a fairly straightforward cache, with parking about 50m from the cache. However, you may have a heck of a time getting down the trail, as the trail is filled with thorns, fallen trees and eventually has you almost walking into a creek. Wllies/rubber boots are recommended after rainfall.

One day, while out driving from the barn to Caledonia for dinner after a hard ride, I took a wrong turn and ended up finding this little bridge, that seemed like the perfect place for a cache. I pulled off onto the side of the road and got out to explore. Down the trail I went, scraping my back as I climbed under a 2 1/2 foot wide downed tree. Got to the edge of the water and found where I wanted to place the cache... a place that required me to straddle a tree, and almost fall off the side of the bank to place it. What that means: you're going to have fun retrieving it. :)

It's in the obvious spot, just please be careful while signing the log book. We don't want anyone riding home with wet feet.

Please leave the logbook and pen in the cache - there is lots of other swag for trading. Thanks.</groundspeak:long_description>

At this particular place, I saw something a little funny on one of the rocks in the middle of the river, clearly visible from where the cache is placed... about a dozen turtles (of all sizes) sunbathing themselves on a rock! It was the most peculiar thing I had ever seen, so thought a cache would be a great way to mark this spot.

This place is nothing super special. The title of the song refers to an album by the Barenaked Ladies, which I was listening to as I placed this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My first letterboxing cache. After placing many traditional caches, I thought it was time for one of these.

Parking is roadside. This road is fairly quiet.

The final is a regular size cache containing a stamp and inkpad plus logbook and other trading items.
If you're not into letterboxing, you can still find this cache and trade some swag. There is room for small Travel Bugs. 

Please trade up or trade even. The hike to this one isn't far but the bushwack isn't fun, hence terrain level.
Stay safe!</groundspeak:long_description>

Log sheet damp but signable. The stamp and the stamp pad were wet inside their baggie. I still have pink fingers from handling them. Tried to dry it out as best as possible and closed the lid tight, but this type of container will probably leak again. Rehid it and covered it up a little better than found.

Nice to see a cemetary cache with a pen in it :D

You know who you are...

This church has a LOT of interesting history behind it, which is why I felt the desire to place a cache here.

The Second baptist Church of Onondaga Township, before its reorganization, was in connection and under the superintendence of the regular baptist Church in Binbrook, Wentworth County, and prior to 1857 was visited by Elder Wm. Hooper, who was then living in this township, Deacon Alfred Bingham of Glanford, and Rev. Job Moxom, of the Binbrook Church. They held meetings at the residences of brethren, and also in the school house at the Mulligan Settlement, converting many to Christ. In 1854 Elder Hooper, having the interest of his church at heart, succeeded in building a chapel for regular worship on Lot 19, 1st concession, on the farm of William Mulligan, for which he afterwards was paid by the members and friends of church enterprise. A meeting was called on the 13th of June, 1857, for the organization of the society. In July 1st of the same year it became an established church. There were, previous to and at the time of this church organization in this township, the following regular Baptist brethren and sisters: Elder Wm. Hooper, Christina Hooper, Elizabeth Hooper, David Jones, Elizabeth Jones, John Hicks, Harriet Hicks, John Boylan, Ann Elizabeth Creighton, Frederick Ricker, Eleanor Ricker, Catharine Ricker, John Cowie, Isabella Cowie, Mary Hooper, John Peddie (now the Rev. Dr. Peddie) John McConichie, Catherine Mulligan, Margaret Mulligan, Richard Mulligan and Robert Mulligan, all of whom became members of the Second Baptist Church after its reorganization, and with others making a total membership at that time of fifty-seven communicants. Elder Job Moxom was also largely instrumental in the formation of this society. Rev. N. Richards is its present pastor, and the members of the church in good standing now number seventy-seven. 

Elder William Hooper was born in England, and emigrated to this country in 1838, and to this township in 1839. He resided a short time in hamilton, where he subsequently received his ordination. Mr. Hooper died in the Township of Oneida, County Haldimand, on the 29th March, 1876, in the 74th year of his age, and in the triumph of his faith, beloved by all for his good works. He is buried in the cemetery attached to the church he was instrumental in building. 

John Peddie, one of the first members of the Second Baptist church, was a native of this township; entered the ministry, and is now a Doctor of Divinity, and has the pastorate of one of the most influential Baptist churches in New York City. 

The church and cemetery are located at 330 Baptist Church road, next to the hydro land. This cemetry is under the supervision of the Cemetery Board of Onondaga Baptist Church. It is still active, accepting new burials, and is very well maintained, and currently contains 274 records. The church has not been used since the 1980's.

The cache is a regular sized lock n lock, located in a camo bag. Please replace the cache in the bag, and then back into its hiding place.

Please be respectful of your surroundings and leave the pen in the cache. :D</groundspeak:long_description>

I just love this park - it is nice in the summer. It offers a great view of the city, a basketball court, a great play park (located 300m the cache, but still worth it to bring the kids) and a wooded area. The cache is located in the wooded area on a hill - it will be slippery when wet but isn't too steep. 

Good luck finding the cache, and please let me know if you think the terrain rating needs to be increased. 

Also, please remember to hide as well or better than you found it. THANKS</groundspeak:long_description>

Just a medium sized take out container, black plastic with a clear lid. Inside, you'll find a collection of construction-related items, mostly small toys resembling the big toys my dad likes to work with and play on. 

Should be well hidden, but please rehide it as well or better than you found it. No tricks, no puzzles, just a good old traditional cache. Please stick to the theme. Thanks.

Cache is located on crown land, but the store owners ARE AWARE of the cache and don't mind if you borrow their parking lot for the quick find.

Just another simple roadside cache in an area that, prior to today, was devoid of caches. Nothing fancy, just a roadside grab and go.

Cache is small but is big enough for smaller trade items, TBs, coins. It DOES have a pencil in it so you'll be ok for writing utensils, until the pencil runs out of lead anyways. :)

Please replace as found and careful of the tree - it's a little rotten in places..

I am almost certain we have all been there... we get so involved in the heat of the moment that we do something others would consider crazy/stupid, all in the name of finding a geocache. This cache is a tribute to those moments where we say to ourselves, &quot;well, hindsight is 20/20...&quot;

My best hindsight is 20/20 moment came on a cache in Brantford, about 3 weeks after I purchased my new GPS. It was late spring, and I decided to go out alone to find a geocache that popped up about 3 km from home. That right there probably should have been enough to stop me - I was not confident with my GPS yet, and it was spring, so it was slippery and wet. 

I loaded the co-ords into my GPS and started on my journey... eventually coming to a stream that needed to be crossed. I had two options... wade across it, as it was only knee-deep, or proceed about 50m upstream and cross on a fallen log. I chose the high snd dry method, as it was quite cool and I didn't feel like getting wet.

I started to cross the log when I heard a slight crack, but, focusing on finding the cache, didn't think anything of it. Took another step and CRACK! I fell right through the log... almost. As a female, I have a larger chest than I do stomach, and so I got caught! The log pressed against my chest and back, holding me about a foot above the water (so I was able to stay dry), but in the process I sprained my ankle and knee and broke two ribs, as well as tearing my jacket and shirt, and some cuts and bruises. Overall, not my finest moment... but it gets better.

Being 100% stuck in the log, I had no choice but to use my PAF to try and get ahold of someone to come resuce me. I was a new cacher and so the only cacher I had in my phone was my sister... who called the fire department. I have NEVER been so embrassed in my whole life... having 6 male firefighters come running down the bank to where I was (fortunately I had my co-ordinates so I was easy to find), and having them cut me out of the tree (while my sister sat on the sidelines and laughed, and laughed, AND LAUGHED!)

Worst of all... they made me go to Urgent Care and so I DNF`d the cache. BUMMER!!

Naturally, I have been afraid to go across logs over streams ever since, and now try to go geocaching with a buddy whenever I can.

When you log your find, please feel free to share your best Hindsight is 20/20 geocaching moment. We, the geocaching community, will try not to laugh too hard at you.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is for all of my cache-addict friends... you all know who you are. Maybe you're the one who's found a cache every day for 200+ days. Maybe you're the one who has a bunch of really awesome hides all over Ontario. Or maybe you just like caching as an activity and find ways to make the sport better for others. In any case, this cache is for you.

As avid geocachers, there are lots of little things we do, that muggles would find strange or downright crazy. This cache is a tribute to all of those little (and not so little) things that make us unique from all the muggles out there.

I have started the list off with 20 things, but think it would be fun if each cacher who finds the cache adds something to the list in their log. You don't have to play, but I'm sure you have lots of ideas out there! Let's see just how long we can make this list!

You know you're a geocacher when:

1. Your new favourite store is Canadian Tire/Princess Auto.
2. You buy groceries based on what containers could be reused as geocaches.
3. You keep a GPS, spare batteries, extra geocaches and a flashlight in the car at all times, &quot;just in case...&quot;
4. You've found a cache at 2 am.
5. You've gone out for a FTF at midnight.
6. You have skipped work/school to go geocaching.
7. You plan your vacations based on geocaching events or cache density.
8. You find yourself on the GC.com forums at 2 am.
9. You have no tupperware in the house (it's all in the woods somewhere...)
10. the address printed on your checks is N 43° 12.389 W 080° 13.992 (or similar)
11. Your car/boat/truck is a trackable.
12. YOU are a trackable.
13. You know what a 'gerr' is...
14. You no longer need a legend to decrypt hints.
15. You have signed an official document using your geocaching name.
16. You have a pile of 30 ready-to-place geocaches in your bedroom, just waiting to be place.
17. You teach your 3 year old neice/nephew/daughter/son/grandchild to read a GPS...
18. You start ordering Kids Meals so you can have the toys as swag.
19. You dress up as a geocache for Halloween.
20. GC.com is your homepage.

Difficulty rating is for math calculations and research online/around the historial site.
Terrain rating for for the crawling you'll have to do if you're taller than 3'0 to get to the cache.

Myrtleville House was built by Irish settler Allen Good in the early 19th century. Myrtleville House Museum still stands in a spacious lot in Brantford, Ontario, and serves as a memoir of life during this time period.  The traditional farmhome tells the tale of four generations of the Good family and their lives in Brant County as it expanded and grew through the remainder of the 19th and 20th centuries.  

Myrtleville House Museum is operated by the city of Brantford and is open for tours throughout the year. 

However, you don't have to do the tour to find this cache, although it's a great way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon if you're into history.

What you DO need to do to find this cache: you need to find out some info about Alan Good and his family. 

Info can be researched online, or you can go to Myrtleville House and do the tour. I don't feel that having to pay to do a tour should be a requirement to find a cache, so I am allowing for internet research to save y'all some $$; us college kids can't afford to spend any more than we already do!!

Info you need to determine:
a) The year Myrtleville House was built and furnished. Year = _ _ _ _ (sum should be 19)
b) The year that William Charles Good (Allen's son) formed the United Farmers of Ontario. Year =  _ _ _ _ (sum should be 15)
c) The year that the Good family donated the house and property to Heritage Canada. Year = _ _ _ _(Sum should be 25)

What you need to figure out:

Co-ords for the cache: N 43 AA.AAA W 080 BB.BBB

AA.AAA = (answer to a) x 6 - 84 x 7
BB.BBB = (answer to b + answer to c) / 7 x ((answer to c - answer to b) / 2) + 42

Please assume decimals.

Cache should be fairly straight forward once you have the co-ords. 

Please let me know if you find any mistakes in my math - it's been a few years since I took math!

On long, cold days, Pasha likes to wander around warm places. This is one of those places she frequents to wander, look around and grab a bite to eat.

Cache is a regular sized lock'n'lock container that contains a log book and the usual geoswag. Please trade up or trade even.

Located in a swampy area near the shopping centre, but you don't actually have to go in the swamp to get it. It should be perfectly accessible from dry land. Easiest access is off the Roy Blvd, rather than from the mall parking lot.

UPDATE: June 1/2011 - the area has flooded this spring, with all of the rain we have been having, however the cache is dry. You MAY get your feet wet after extremely heavy rains. Will check on it again in a month or so and see what the water level is doing.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Today, I thought that I would go out and place a couple of simple caches for 13coach13's The Hides of March II event, occuring tomorrow. Apparently, it wasn't to be...

The cache itself is a small lock n' lock container that contains log book and some tradables. The cache is not designed to be overly difficult or trecherous, however, for me, the difficult part came when it was time to leave.

For those who don't know me, I drive a VW New Beetle, that I love and adore, but naturally isn't very good in the mud. Enter geocaching placement. I had the BRILLIANT idea to pull up off the road onto a little gravel driveway. PERFECT for one or two cars to pull off the road, so the cachers can find the cache. Right? WRONG!

Even though my car is not an overly heavy car, in the time it took me to place the cache, take three sets of co-ords and average them out, my car sank about 6 inches into the mud... just enough to get myself EXTREMELY stuck. So, what do I do? I decide to attempt to get myself unstuck by putting pedal to the metal and flooring it. What does this do? Absolutely nothing, except spray the entire front of my white car with mud. Yay.

At this point, I decide to get out and push it, seeing if my little car could be budged using my (weak) muscles. Nope, nothing. So I tried to put some rocks and random branches under the front tires, hoping to get some grip. Nope, they sank in the mud too.

Time to phone a friend, I guess... until I realize all my geocaching friends are busy, and all my non-geocaching friends would just laugh at me for getting stuck in the first place.

Luckily, while I was sitting in my car, a very friendly tow truck driver just happened to be driving by where the cache was placed, and noticed my little predicament. He was able to tow me out and save my littler car. Best of all - he was a geocacher, so understood the whole geocaching thing!! Hopefully he is reading this now and can try for the FTF.

Moral of the story - if it is wet/spring/fall/raining, DO NOT attempt to park on the gravel driveway that looks like it would be a safe place to park off the road, unless you have some good friends with tow lines you can call at a moments' notice. :)

Please don't repeat my mistake. Stay safe!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is just a quick simple puzzle to mess with your heads early in the morning, or late at night. Should be fairly easy to figure out once you get the hang of it.

In order to get the co-ords for the cache, you need to solve this puzzle.

DLob89 and I were hiking one day, and found this picturesque spot. Stopping to take some pics, I also found a crab apple tree. Yay, a snack AND a photo op!

And a perfect spot for a cache.

Nothing too difficult here although the terrain is a little rough. Wear hiking shoes or runners, not sandals.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is a simple thermos-like container with a twist on/off lid. Currently it has a log book and some swag. Trackables and coins will fit if they are smaller.

Hike is about 150m from roadside parking. I saw a snake while placing this cache, so those who are leary of snakes should do this one with a buddy.

As the (currently unnamed) Brant and Area Caching Group is planning their first ever event on Wednesday, September 29th, 2010, I decided this would be a good place to set up a simple cache for the cachers who are attending this event.

This cache is quite close to an access point for the GVT, but is really just a cool area to bring the dog for a walk or do a little exploring. I always love little, tranquil spots like this, especially since it's so close to the city.

This is a park and grab, with a mild incline. Light bushwack may be needed in summer.

Please trade up or trade even. Cache is a small but still big enough for TBs, coins, keychains, etc.

Good luck and see you on the trails!</groundspeak:long_description>

In order to solve this puzzle cache, you have to find a table online showing the morse code letters and numbers and translate the info below to find the co-ordinates for the actual cache.

I have separated words with / to make it easier for individuals who aren't familiar with more code. Letters are separated by 3 spaces. The end of ever sentance has //. While not accurate to true more code, this should make it easier to solve. :) - is equal to one dash, . is equal to one dot.

Cache is a regular sized container with log book and swag. Cache was replaced in April 2011. Please let me know.

You can access this cache on public property by parking roadside and walking the 250m or so along the hydro property to the creek. Follow the creek NE until you reach GZ.

OK everyone, time to fess up!! If you've stolen, borrowed without asking, or accidentally taken something without telling the person, here's your chance to get forgiveness without getting in trouble. 

The story behind this cache... well, this cache container magically appeared in my caching bag one day... and as a form of &quot;revenge&quot; I was told not to return it by the person who took it (not that I will mention any names, right D??). Don't worry, it's not one of the missing ones you all are worried about... it was a dummy cache on a &quot;multi&quot; that drove both theif and I NUTS!!!! If the former owner wants it back, (s)he's welcome to replace it with a container of his or her own choosing. :)

Nothing hard about this cache, as the whole point of this cache is to seek forgiveness from those whom we may have hurt in the past. Should be a quick park and grab, although please make sure you recover the cache to ensure it stays protected. 

So, let the sob stories begin!!

No traders here... although there is a pencil in the cache you may want to take a pen in case. 

Happy hunting, and remember, please no negativities towards all those who have done wrong in the past!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>if you hated this container in it's original location... well, this spot really isn't much different.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Please BYOP, and possibly some tweezers depending on how small your fingers are. Please make sure the lid is replaced tightly.

While out searching for a nearby cache, I looked down from the road and saw a beautiful lake tucked down in here. However, upon closer inspection, there doesn't appear to be a way to get to it without getting wet feet; at least not from this access point. This was the farthest possible point I was willing to travel to in my hiking shoes... but perhaps you will be braver?

CITO is always welcome in the area. Parking is roadside or in the small lot across the road. Please think safety first when crossing the street, and be careful of heavy machinery in the area from the nearby storage facilities.

Update: 7/11/11 - increasing the difficulty of the cache due to the number of DNFs. Went to check on it, it is there.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not too long ago, a local chef placed a small geocache near where we come to play our L1 and L5 year.

Pasha88, who works with us, asked that the cache be moved due to its proximity to us... we didn't like seeing the flashlights at night. Pasha88 grabbed the cache and gave it to us, on chef's orders, for our program here at camp. But, we thought it would be a better idea to place it somewhere else, as a new cache for the chef to find.

Pasha88 helped us pick out a spot on the map, then did the leg work for us, so we could place this special cache for an awesome cacher. 

The cache is the original container that the chef had placed, but we added a few bits of ourselves as well. 

We hope that you enjoy finding the cache. It shouldn't be too hard, as we asked Pasha88 to keep it &quot;kid friendly&quot;.

And so we say, this one is for the chef... Galloping Gourmet!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On order to find this cache, you'll have to do a series of high school level physics problems to determine the co-ordinates. I know difficulty 5 seems quite high, but really it's easy if you look it up online and have a basic knowledge of math. Shouldn't take you that long to figure out once you know what you're doing. 
The first 4 are all related to one another on each other, the last one is a random fact you'll have to Google.

The actual cache is a 1.5/1.5. difficulty rating is for the puzzle.

Cache can be found at:

N 43 aa.bcc
W 080 dd.eee

aa. 

Phineas and Ferb come by for a cold drink after work, but as they work as phsyicists at the local university, they only speak in Kelvins. Ferb says &quot;Boy, was it cold today! It's May, and it was only 285.15K&quot; 

Convert from Kelvins to Celcius. _ _ C = aa

b. 

&quot;You know&quot; said Ferb, &quot;it was only 276.15K in  Newfoundland. You think it's cold here, you should fly there!&quot; 

 Convert from Kelvins to Celcius. _ C = b

cc. 

&quot;Wow&quot; you exclaim. &quot;It's been cold everywhere! Why, it was only 17.8 C in Phoenix, Arizona. what's going on with the world?&quot;

Convert from celcius to fahrenheit. _ _ = cc

_ _ =cc

dd. 

&quot;What is the world coming to?&quot; asked Ferb. &quot;In Tenessee, parts of the area are still under over 120 inches of water!&quot;

Convert from inches into feet. _ _ feet = dd

eee.

&quot;Yikes&quot; says Phineas. &quot;I have an idea! Maybe the reason the Earth is so wierd right now is because there's too much  technetium. After all, it has the lowest atomic number of any element that does not possess stable isotopes. &quot;

What is the atomic number of technetium?

0 _ _ = eee

Once everyone finishes their drinks, Phineas and Ferb head home to begin more research for their next physics-related problem. :)

Good luck and feel free to contact me if you need help.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first of my geocaching hides that I have imported to opencaching
The cache is hidden in a school bus and even though many open water divers go through the bus it is still considered an overhead environment so I would recommend you have at a mininum cavern training. This cache while quite awesome is not worth dying over
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


I have submerged a regular size Tupperware container in the front
of an underwater school bus I used the Geocaching rating system
which gave the cache an automatic 5 for terrain and difficulty just
due to the fact that specialized equipment was needed. Assuming
that you can scuba it should be an easy find and the difficulty
would be a 2 at the most

  &lt;br/&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is a regular
Tupperware container 8x 3.5 inches that is filled with water (but
still floats)   You can open the container underwater and
sign an underwater dive slate which I am using as a
log.&lt;br/&gt;


 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the posted GPS
Coordinates enter the water which will put you to the left of the
bus&lt;br/&gt;
Descend to the bottom (about
20 feet) and turn right and the bus will be about 15 feet
away&lt;br/&gt;
It is best to do it this way
as the visibility can be near zero at times although when I hid it
I had at least 10-15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trout Lake was a working
quarry from 1928 to 1937 when it flooded   Later turned
into a recreational facility it offers  camping, fishing
swimming and scuba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am embarassed to admit
that I have spent a week of my life  underwater here and the
quarry has sunk a couple of buses, fuselages of a cessna and
Harvard Trainer as well as a few cars and boats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Enter from the front door, keep your head under the steering wheel facing the side of the bus and reach directly forward to your right</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A tribute to the girls and boys I work with each morning; Bricker, Royal, Vitro and Rocket.

Every morning for the last few months, I have gotten up before dawn and gone to work at the Paris race track, located at the Paris fairgrounds. Come by between 7 and 9 every morning and you will find many of us dedicated horse owners (or, in my case, the hired help) exercising some of the finest standardbreds in the area. Some, like Royal, have a real drive to win. Others, like Rocket, are just coming back from a long, tough injury. And, there are those who are just pets, like my &quot;little&quot; Bricker and Vitro. 

Located not too far from the race track, this cache was placed one morning after my chores were completed and Bricker and I decided to go for a wander to get some grass and stretch our legs (it's a tough life living in a safe stall, being fed food every 2 hours, all day every day). Across the street you'll find a small, field area that no one seems to really own, but is used for extra parking during the Paris Fair, Labour Day Weekends. The cache itself is a regular sized tupperware style container and contains a number of horsey items - Sires' Stakes keychain, toy horses and fencing, pins, a bridle charm, horsey bumper sticker, horse pen, etc. As I was trying to handle a horse and place a cache at the same time as I was placing it, it may not be perfect, but it's been averaged a few times for accuracy. Watch out for the horse tracks and come say hi if you notice a white VW beetle in the parking lot across from the cache.

This is a quick, roadside park and grab along a stretch of highway 2. Shoulders here are nice and wide and should allow for even transport trucks to pull off safely. Please remember to use your 4-way flashers and be careful if you find yourself crossing the road. Please do not enter private property - there is no need to find the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache for a &quot;famous&quot; local cacher - another one for her FTF hunt.

13coach13 has only been caching for just under 2 years, but already has over 1000 finds (That's at least one every single day since she started...almost 2/day). The coach has hidden a few as well, making her one of my geo-heroes of Brantford. 

If you know the coach, you'll know she pretty much eats, sleeps and breathes geocaching... she was the organizer of Brantford's first ever event cache (along with Greenthumb9, talonnfenton and myself) and continues to come up with ingenious caches for her fellow geocachers. 

Anyways, I have wanted to place one specifically for the coach since that event and am just getting around to it now. 

About the cache: small, round and should be a fairly quick grab and go. Parking is roadside. Please stay back from the nearby railroad tracks, there is absolutely no reason to approach them from any angle. You should be able to stay back 30 feet or so from the lights/crossing signal.

Tall grass may contain critters, so careful at night.

Good luck and have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cemetery is now inactive and has been for several years. It is under the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the County of Brant. It is reasonably maintained, although has seen a fair bit of damage and vandalism in the past. There are 41 burial records here which can be found online or by reading each stone. The United Church building is gone and those grounds are now a playground for children. 

The cache is not located near the playground, but rather on the edge of the cemetery.

Please remember to BYOP and be careful of your surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Big Bang Thoery has many meanings, including the popular TV show of the same name. This is the third in a series of 10 caches created in a tribute to the Big Bang Theory and the hilariosity the show brings to TV, in particular, Sheldon Cooper. 

Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are both brilliant physicists working at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California. They are colleagues, best friends and roommates, although in all capacities their relationship is always tested primarily by Sheldon's regimented and non-conventional ways. They are also friends with their Cal Tech colleagues, mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The foursome spend their time working on their individual work projects, playing video games, watching science fiction movies or reading comic books. As they are self-professed nerds, all have little or no luck with &quot;popular&quot; women. When Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring actress originally from Omaha, moves into the apartment next to Leonard and Sheldon's, Leonard has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his girlfriend.
Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, is the nerdiest of them all; the king of the comic book geeks, the smartest of the group, and, of course, the character with some of the most hilarious one-liners known to the scientific community.

In my head, I see the nerds of Big Bang Theory enjoying geocaching due to the technological aspect of using government-placed, multi-billion dollar sattelites to find tupperware in the woods. Maybe it's just me though, as nerds typically don't like the outdoors, but I can dream, right?

Anyways, in this very memorable opening, the boys are in a VERY heated video game (World of Warcraft, for those who care)battle, fighting for the Sword of Azeroth. The boys played for 97 hours as a team until they arrived at the Gates of Elzebub. There, they battled a host of armed goblins protecting the sword, but instead of helping, Sheldon grabbed the Sword, teleported out of the dungeon, and sold the Sword on eBay. However, as you will see, another member of the squard buys it... and becomes the SWORD MASTER!!

The cache should be a fairly simple find. Easy parking is roadside just a few metres from the cache. Careful as the &quot;concealment&quot; is rotting away quite nicely and will break if you apply too much pressure.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In order to solve this puzzle, you are going to have to use your deductive reasoning and logical thinking skills in order to sort out who Lucy's ideal man is.

Read the story below. In it, you will find clues to help you figure out which guy Lucy is likely to date. Once you decide who YOU think Lucy should date, find the associated co-ordinates (at the bottom of this listing) and go out to find the cache. There are four sets of co-ords below, one for each possible mate. Make sure you read the story carefully to be sure you get all the clues.

The Ideal Man

Lucy strutted up the street, passing a stranger who resembled Frankenstein carrying a six-pack of lager. She presumed they were headed for the same place – who else would wear a costume in the middle of February. The dull thuds of distant music lead them both up the stone path to a small cottage. Sally opened the door, still sober enough to remember to greet her guests.

“Lucy! Great! Now we can really get this party started!”

Lucy was impressed with Sally’s outfit – fake black and white Dalmatian fur and a matching black and white chapeau and wig for a great Cruella De Ville. Looking down, she wished she had made more of an effort with her own costume. 

“Who are you supposed to be, then?” Sally asked Lucy, taking her coat and scrutinizing her brown dress. “Give me a hint.”

Frankenstein squeezed passed them, groaning. Lucy frowned.
“Look, it’s not my fault if I can’t guess it!” Sally led her friend inside. 

Lucy frowned again, shifting her frown slightly to the right. Sally was confused. 

“The Mona Lisa!” Lucy exclaimed. “You know, with that glum face?”

“But it’s more of a smirk,” Sally pouted, “and anyways, that skirt is WAY too short to be anything that Mona would have worn.&quot;

“Ok, ok…” Lucy conceded, “I should have worn a better costume. I don’t know, Sal, you throw a party and give me a chance to meet some cute guys and I can’t even really tell what they look like! They’re all aliens and cowboys and kings.” 

“That Frankenstein seemed to like you…”

“No way. He’s not my type.”

Sally and Lucy walked past a couple of mermaids and into the kitchen, pulling a bottle of wine out of the fridge.

“Before you start whining about how you’re never going to meet the right guy, there’s something I should tell you,” whispered Sally, spotting a police officer in the hallway. “You can’t say I never do anything for you… there are four bachelors here tonight!” 

Lucy wasn’t overly optimistic. &quot;But Sal, you know the only type of many I will go for is one who’s tall with big brown eyes, and rich!”

“You forgot handsome,” Sally grinned.

“No, that goes without saying.”

Sally led Lucy by the hand towards the living room and the deep, pulsating music. “Follow me,” she trilled. “Sadly, only one of the four guys is rich, and only two have brown eyes. But, three of the men are tall. Each man meets at least one of your criteria, and, of course, there is one man who is your ideal man – big brown eyes, tall and rich! You won’t be disappointed.”

“Great party, Sally!” Captain Kirk gave a cheerful wave.
 
“Him?” Lucy immediately perked up. This was looking interesting. She realised her guess was wrong when Catwoman appeared and gave the man a kiss. 

“Come and try the dip,” smiled Sally. “There’s salsa, too.” Sally was making strange twitching movements with her head. Lucy realised this was some sort of signalling technique and scuttled to her side.
 
“There,” Sally pointed to the far corner. “Single man number one – Michael.” Then, she pointed over to the drinks table. “ Those two are Paul and Simon…” Sally nodded at a man chatting with some friends. “And last but not least, we have John.”

Lucy smiled. “Not bad going, Sally! I can see that three of them are tall and two have big brown eyes. I’d call this an impressive start.”

“Of course. We aim to please.”

“So who’s who? Which one’s got all three?” Lucy glanced across at the four men. 

Sally smiled, teasing. “That’s for me to know and for you to find out.” Grinning, she wandered off to chat with some other guests, glancing back to see who Lucy aimed for first. 

“Psst! You could at least introduce me!” Lucy exclaimed, grabbing her friend’s arm. 

“Hello, are you a friend of Sally’s?”

Lucy spun around and saw Michael behind her, drink in hand. She smiled. Not a bad start to the evening. 

“Yes, and you?”

“Right.” Michael sipped his beer, froth clinging to his upper lip. “And you are?”

Lucy did her frown, Michael didn’t understand. Lucy tried a lighter smirk. “Think art. Think Italy. Think Da Vinci.” 

Michael looked her up and down, looking vague. 

“The Mona Lisa!!” she exclaimed.

“Oh, right.” The man was obviously not impressed. “I meant, what’s your name?”

Lucy told him, and watched him wander off. What was so original about his costume anyways?

She turned around to find Paul at her side. “I’m Lucy, and before you ask, I’ve come as the Mona Lisa, not as myself or as my look-alike cousin Val.”

“I’m Paul…” said the handsome young man. “And I’m supposed to be…”

Lucy drained her glass and nodded. “I can tell. Very nice.”

Paul dutifully headed for the drinks table and brought back a bottle of wine, quickly refilling Lucy’s glass. 

She was starting to enjoy herself. This was rather fun. Both he and Michael had the same colour eyes, and he had a lovely smile.

“I’ll be back in a minute,” Lucy raised her voice over the music, shouting up to Paul’s ear. “Don’t go away!”
She rushed off to the washroom.

When she got back downstairs, Lucy found Paul standing with Simon, enjoying a man-talk about the hockey score. She smiled. They were quite different in appearance, but as they stood beside one another, Lucy noticed they were almost exactly the same height. This was getting interesting. 

“Look, it’s Mona Lisa!” Simon grinned. Lucy was impressed; Simon was intelligent as well. “Paul told me,” the man admitted. “But, that’s a lovely dress.”

“Thanks,” Lucy’s eyes flitted between Paul and Simon enjoying the flirtation. She looked around for Sally, but her friend was nowhere to be seen. She smiled across at John, who gave a little wave. She noticed that he and Simon were not built of the same stature. 

“Hi, I’m Lucy,” She shook hands with the last man. “I’ve heard a lot about you.” 

“Really?” John seemed surprised. “I like your outfit, very smart.”

Lucy was having fun. She had to go and tell Sally. She found her friend in the kitchen, refilling the punchbowl. 

“He’s a bit like Tom Cruise in “Top Gun”, he’s perfect!” Lucy gushed.

“Only he’s not tall?”

“Who isn’t tall?” Lucy asked, confused.

“Tom Cruise,” Sally replied. “He’s only like five foot something.” 

“Well, then he takes second place,” Lucy smiled, “because I have already found my number one.”

Lucy headed back into the party, drink in hand. She smiled; she’d found her ideal man.

Who was tall and rich with big brown eyes? Who was Lucy’s Ideal Man?

If you think that Lucy’s ideal man is Michael, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 14.338 W 080 16.934

If you think that Lucy’s ideal man is Paul, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 13.332 W 080 15.308

If you think that Lucy’s ideal man is Simon, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 15.476 W 080 15.474

If you think that Lucy’s ideal man is John, you should go to the co-ordinates: N 43 14.329 W 080 15.468

The cache itself is a regular sized lock'n'lock container with swag. There is a pen in the cache, but I would suggest bringing your own just in case. Please remember to cover the cache as well or better than you found it so it doesn't get muggled.

If you have any questions, please email me.

Cache is a small lock'n'lock, bigger than a micro but smaller than a small. It has been reused from a previous cache, so please ignore the name on the outside of the container (I believe in cache-cycling).

The cache does have some small trade items in it, but no room for a pen so please bring your own. 

Please make sure you cover the cache up well before you leave the area so it remains hidden.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Out caching this afternoon, I inadvertently got a little bit... lost. 

With 3 GPS receivers in the car (two handhelds and a nagivation system), you'd think it would be pretty much impossible for me to get lost; and yet it happens almost every time I try and go caching on my own. 

On one of my afternoon drive-around-in-a-circle-until-I-see-something-I-recognize adventures, I came across this bridge that I ended up crossing about 6 times. :D 

&quot;Forget this!&quot; I said to myself, &quot;I am marking the co-ords on this bridge so I know where it is for future reference...&quot; And what's better than just taking the co-ordinates? Placing a cache.

This cache is designed to be an easy roadside grab, although if you drive anything bigger than a smart car (or VW Beetle) I would suggest parking across the road at the local diner.

Cache isn't big enough for a pen, so please bring your own, and remember to place it back where you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Read the story below and decide who you think is guilty. Once you know Whodunit, look at the co-ords below the story, then go out and find the cache.

You're going to have to use your logical thinking skills to solve this one. 

The cache itself is a regular sized lock'n'lock container, well hidden. There is some swag in the cache (typical dollar store) so feel free to trade, just please trade up or trade even.

Dying for Snow

Every fortnight when you make your mail flight up to Pickle Lake, you look forward to visiting old Hildie. All the folks up at the lake are fine by you, but when you deliver Hildie's mail, you're not just doing your job - you're exercising a genuine pleasure. Hildie keeps a moonshine still, way back in the pine trees of her 50-acre spread. This trip, though, Hildie was so overwrought she forgot her manners and pounced on the mail packet without offering you a drink. She found the envelope from the photo lab in Kenora and ripped it open, saying, &quot;Now those guys'll have to believe me.&quot;

A glance at the photograph showed Hildie was telling the truth two weeks ago when she handed you the film. As she had predicted, the picture showed a body lying in the snow, beyond the chain-link fence that the gold mine had erected around its mining site. Hildie was right about something else, too. This was a genuine mystery. The woman was lying between two great pines in the middle of an expanse of fresh snow. There were no tracks leading to her body, except the pockmarks of a large dog and the holes made by snow falling from the branches above. There was no snow on the woman, not even a dusting, so the only way she could have got there was if she had fallen from the sky.

Yet this wasn't as far-fetched as it might sound. The arrival of the gold miners had also brought eco-warriors up from the south. The activists were intent on scaling the trees around the mines and this woman was likely one of them, a protester who had fallen from her perch. If that cleared up half the mystery, it didn't explain the rest of Hildie's story.

Hildie is in her 70s and had a bad limp. Rather than scrape through a gap in the chain-link fence to get to the body, she went home to radio for help. Unfortunately, she was out of methanol and her generator was dry, so the radio wouldn't work. You told her she should have filled the generator with moonshine, and she said she wished she had thought of that - the woman might still be alive. Instead, she locked up her dog, Betsy, and drove to the sheriff's office in Pickle Lake, taking the photo on the way. By the time the sheriff and Hildie returned to the site, the body was gone and a fresh fall of snow left no traces as to how she might have disappeared. With no body, there was no mystery. As the sheriff said at the time, no one knew how but the woman hadn't simply got up and wandered away? You had seen Hildie's photographs, you knew this was impossible. Dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, the woman would have died of hypothermia in half an hour.

Hildie asked, &quot;Do you recognise her?&quot;

You can't say you did, but these eco-warriors prefer to travel by sea rather than take your mail flight up from Kenora. The boys who came with you were Hildie's sworn enemies: lumberjacks. On this trip, you had flown out 10 big guys; no doubt hired to cut the eco-warriors out of the trees and maybe throw a scare into them. You apologised to Hildie for this, but she knows you don't get to pick and choose my passengers.

Hildie had lived the simple life in Pickle Lake for more than 40 years and she had no intention of selling up. She was even doing her bit for the protesters, allowing them to set up a base camp on her land. When you saw their camp on your last trip, you thought, that makes sense of the letters Hildie had been receiving from Toronto over the past year. She and the eco-warriors may have been in cahoots but Hildie was in a minority of one around the Lake. Everyone else would have welcomed an offer from the gold company - but only Hildie owned land in the right vicinity.

After you left Hildie, you recognised one of the protesters, a youngster named Josh Abbot. You still felt guilty for flying up the lumberjacks, so you said hello and warned him the compound fence had been strengthened. It wouldn't be so easy for him to break in and scale the trees. In Hildie's photograph, the fence had been in poor shape, with holes cut out and a few strands of colourful nylon thread snagged on the wire where a protester must have snuck through. Josh thanked you for the information but told you that he and his partner planned to make rope walkways so they could flit from tree to tree. You wished him good luck, and worried that you might see another body on the ground before springtime.

As you were talking, Betsy bounded up and jumped all over Josh. He had clearly made a firm friend. Josh laughed, telling you that he had no idea what kind of reception he would get up in Pickle Lake, but Betsy had made the trip worthwhile. As Hildie always said, Betsy was the smartest dog in the world.

Once the sheriff saw Hildie's picture, he wasted no time calling in Frank Tanner, the watchman for the gold company. It wasn't the sheriff's style to move fast, but what you didn't know until you inveigled your way into his office was that he already had a body. The dead woman had been found in a ravine on the far side of the Lake, about 30 miles from the mining site, which was no distance in such a spread-out community. There was no doubt that this was the woman in Hildie's photograph: she was wearing the same dark jeans and sweats. The sheriff showed Tanner the picture and told him, &quot;This has to be embarrassing, Frank - a dead woman on your shift.&quot; Tanner claimed he didn't know a thing but the sheriff threw a curve-ball and said he'd found Frank's tire tracks around the ravine. There had been more than two feet of snow since the photo was taken, but Tanner was none too bright, and soon admitted to dumping the body. But he swore he had not killed her. Like the sheriff said, he was just saving himself and the gold company the grief of a dead eco-warrior on the site. Later, you asked the sheriff if he believed Tanner's story. The sheriff shrugged, but said once he got the forensic report, he would call the witnesses together and figure out the story.

Things move slowly in Pickle Lake. You flew the woman's body down to Kenora for the autopsy and you were back by the time the sheriff got the results. Tanner was still in the sheriff's cell but the forensic report went some way to supporting his story: the woman had died of hypothermia, not trauma. She was about 40 years old and part native. The local native tribe claimed no one from their tribe was missing. You figured, if none of them knew the dead woman, maybe she was the illegitimate daughter of one of the old boys. The sheriff thought that sounded right.

The sheriff had four possible witnesses. Frank Tanner, of course. Josh Abbot and the other eco-warrior, his girlfriend, Flossie Jones. And finally, old Hildie. You were there, too, and you had to admire the professional set-up. The sheriff had wired up a projector so that you all sat in the half-light, looking at Hildie's photograph blown up on the office wall. Now you saw the photograph so big, you wondered about the faint swirling pattern in the snow, leading away from the woman's body. Hildie was more excited by the tail end of a rope, visible in one of the trees. Flossie and Josh had claimed they had made a start scaling a tree before the weather drove them back to camp. When Hildie said she had seen Frank Tanner cutting down the ropes the next day, he had called her a liar. The photograph clearly showed that Tanner was the liar.

Josh asked the sheriff if the woman showed signs of having fallen from a height. The sheriff said there was nothing conclusive: she had cuts and bruises but no broken bones. Hildie pointed out that the snow was deep enough to have cushioned a fall. Flossie wondered if the dead woman could have got her injuries falling through the brambles into the ravine where she had been found. The sheriff asked how she knew about the brambles, but the girl refused to be trapped: she'd gone along to look at the crime scene after the news came out. The sheriff seemed to accept this. At any rate, he told us that the postmortem proved the woman was alive when she got her cuts and grazes and dead before she entered the ravine.

What else could he tell us? The dead woman had come up from Thunder Bay on the train. Josh and Flossie were adamant they had never seen her before, but the sheriff said she fitted the eco-warrior profile: she had arrests for drinking, drug posession and tresspassing. This time, he got a reaction ... from Hildie. She told the sheriff he ought to be ashamed of himself, casting aspersions on two good kids. Hildie so identified with the eco-warriors, she had taken to dressing like them, though her jacket was a lurid, tatty ski jacket rather than the mountaineering jackets the kids could afford. Once the sheriff had calmed everyone down, he admitted that the crew of the train reported that the dead woman sounded more like a prospector than a protester: prowling the cars regardless of the time of day, wrapped in an old pink shawl as she bragged about a fortune waiting for her in Pickle Lake. The crewmen wrote her off as a fantasist, a damaged woman who was getting on in life and getting desperate.

You said, &quot;However she died, she must have been drunk, stumbling around in the snow or falling out of trees.&quot;

&quot;I don't know if she was drunk,&quot; the sheriff replied. &quot;I can tell you she was blind. And that's the problem. I think we've got a murder inquiry on our hands.&quot;

You nodded sadly. &quot;I think so too, sheriff.&quot;

So Whodunnit? Think you know?

There were 4 suspects: Frank Tanner, Josh Abbot, Flossie Jones or old Hildie.

If you think that Frank Tanner is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 43 15.496 W 080 15.469

If you think that Josh Abbot is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 43 15.388 W 080 14.681

If you think Flossie Jones is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 15.017 W 080 12.793

If you think that Hildie is the killer, you should go to the following co-ordinates: N 43 17.976 W 080 16.791

Good luck!!

For those who don't know, the Santa Maria was one of Columbus' ships during the late 1400's. This park, located in the south-eastern part of the city shares its name.

The park itself boasts a lovely forested area, spray pad, swings and jungle gym. We chose to place this cache in the forested areas. Please be kind to the area and practice CITO and STAY ON THE TRAILS as much as possible - it is possible to get within a couple metres of this cache while still following one of the main trails through the woods.

The cache is a square take out container. It may or may not have the name of another cache on the outside/log book cover - please ignore this as I do recycle caches and logs when possible..

Area gets slippery in the muddy season. May not be winter friendly, as is on ground level, but is waterproof.

A Path entrance, the one you will want to use, has been added as a waypoint. DO NOT use the path that goes across the back of peoples' yards. You won't be able to get to the cache from there.

The cache is now located nowhere near the &quot;neighbour's dumping place&quot;, and is not deep within the trees. It is located in a root base, under a small rock. 

If you are still having problems with it, please let me know, but hopefully no more DNFs to be logged!

The cache area isn't where I'd expect it to be.   We had a look around in the dark.  Cold, dark winter's night doesn't make for a long search.  The hint came in handy.

Stop off and get your thrills, or not. Whatever turns your crank. Could be enlightening. Watch for stray carts.

Good winter cache. Use discretion, watch for muggles.

Please, BYOP. No tools required.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Night cache along a trail system near the village of Blair (part of&lt;br/&gt;Cambridge) with a total hiking distance of about 7 km.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;The Blair Witch is Back!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right! The infamous Blair witch has found a new home&lt;br/&gt;in a wooded area near her home village of Blair (now part of&lt;br/&gt;Cambridge), just off Blair Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear and terror is already spreading among the peaceful people&lt;br/&gt;living close by! Unfortunately there is no-one among the local&lt;br/&gt;population brave enough to face the horrors of fighting against the&lt;br/&gt;witch, so there is only one person left to do the job:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YOU!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hunt the Blair Witch!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Darkness. More specifically: Night. The darker it is, the&lt;br/&gt;better. Clouds will help you, full moon will not. You can&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; do this cache during the day, and you also cannot do it&lt;br/&gt;in the fog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;From that follows: A flashlight. And a proper one. A cell phone&lt;br/&gt;light or a 1-LED-keychain-light will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; do the job. Make&lt;br/&gt;sure you got full batteries too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The following table. The witch has left traces of her evil&lt;br/&gt;doings in the area she now calls home. The local villagers have&lt;br/&gt;collected those pieces of information over time and compiled them&lt;br/&gt;into a list. You will need this list on your hunt, so take it with&lt;br/&gt;you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.429 W 080° 22.525&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.435 W 080° 22.445&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.348 W 080° 22.521&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.296 W 080° 22.632&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.192 W 080° 22.504&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.432 W 080° 22.279&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.801 W 080° 22.486&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.748 W 080° 22.248&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.361 W 080° 22.248&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.754 W 080° 22.200&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;K&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.488 W 080° 22.138&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.691 W 080° 22.310&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.384 W 080° 22.655&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.471 W 080° 21.846&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.409 W 080° 22.209&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.187 W 080° 21.837&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.263 W 080° 22.491&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.262 W 080° 22.029&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.179 W 080° 21.853&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.379 W 080° 22.076&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.737 W 080° 22.230&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;V&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.714 W 080° 22.353&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.590 W 080° 22.301&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.656 W 080° 22.482&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Y&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.315 W 080° 22.282&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Z&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 22.613 W 080° 22.398&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Where to Start&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the header coordinates. They point to the entrance to the&lt;br/&gt;trail system you're about to explore. Limited parking is available&lt;br/&gt;across the road, with room for about 2 cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you arrived at the coordinates, take your flashlight and&lt;br/&gt;look around you. From where you're standing, you will be able to&lt;br/&gt;find a set of reflectors in the distance. This first set here will&lt;br/&gt;be close to where you are and should be easy to find, but that&lt;br/&gt;doesn't necessarily hold true for your onwards journey! Go to the&lt;br/&gt;reflectors and look at them closely, they will tell you where you&lt;br/&gt;need to go next...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of trails in this area and all stages can be&lt;br/&gt;reached by following the trails. However, not all stages are&lt;br/&gt;directly &lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt; the trails, some of them require some&lt;br/&gt;bushwhacking away from the trail to get to them. With some of them&lt;br/&gt;there is even a chance that you get your feet wet if you're not&lt;br/&gt;careful where you step, so you're definitely encouraged to stay on&lt;br/&gt;the trails for as long as possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not jump any fences! You also do not need to cross any&lt;br/&gt;roads!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will know when you have reached your destination. Once&lt;br/&gt;you've found the Blair witch's hideout, it's going to be obvious&lt;br/&gt;where her treasure is hidden. It's a winter-friendly hiding&lt;br/&gt;location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total hiking distance when following the trails in an optimal&lt;br/&gt;way is a little over 7 kilometers. Expect to spend about two hours&lt;br/&gt;or more in here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache contains the geocache essentials (logbook, pencils,&lt;br/&gt;sharper - do not remove those items!) and some trading items.&lt;br/&gt;There's plenty of room for swag and trackables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember: If you trade, trade equal or up! Also please stick&lt;br/&gt;to the halloween/witch theme if possible!&lt;/b&gt; Trackable items are&lt;br/&gt;always welcome, regardless of theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not leave spoilers in your logs, especially not&lt;br/&gt;about how many stages there are!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Have fun and good luck!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a few other caches in this area, which you may or&lt;br/&gt;may not want to get while you're out doing this one... ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 I kept seeing this tower on the way to the 401 from Homer Watson, so we finally decided to check out the area. At the cache location, the GPS recorded an elevation of 355 meters, that's about as high as it gets around here...

There is an all-year high chance of slippery ascent due to mud or snow, so be sure to bring good shoes. Bugspray needed in summer. There is no actual trail, so choice of route is ultimately up to you, but look under the additional waypoints for a suggested starting point.

&lt;b&gt;Do not approach&lt;/b&gt; this cache coming from the west (Pinnacle Drive) or south, as this is &lt;b&gt;private property&lt;/b&gt;! Come from the &lt;b&gt;north or the east only&lt;/b&gt;!

Cache is a small Lock &amp; Lock container with room for small items and trackables. There's a toonie for FTF prize (or if Galloping Gourmet is first, it's a moontoonie :-P).

There is evidence of people (ab)using this area for various questionable activities and you could perform some minor CITO here.

Last but not least, &lt;b&gt;have fun&lt;/b&gt;!

Congrats to &lt;i&gt;Hats n' Sweater&lt;/i&gt; for FTF!

Pack up what I thought I would need for a complete day of geocaching as my plan was to get as much done while the sun was up.  Put my bike, kayak, rope, step ladder, rubber boots, hiking stick, lots of water, and other tools that would be needed for this adventure of caching.  My ever faithful geodog Champ also accompanied me, as caching can't be the same without him as he seems to have a very keen geosense.... of course he is a border collie.  Great day to cache before the temperature dips and the snow starts flying.  Know this area well so didn't find it too difficult but still enjoyed the challenge.  Great hide, well worth the adventure.  TFTH</groundspeak:text>

24 Hour Geocaching Marathon. &lt;br/&gt;
This carpool lot is the starting point for over a dozen geocachers
that went geocaching in the Kitchener-Waterloo area for 24 hours
straight, on August 12 2006.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cachers were being treated to the following this year: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full moon, which makes for easier night caching - One meteor
shower, so you can walk off the trail because you were looking at
the sky, not your GPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three vehicles to choose from! The &quot;Red Jeep&quot;, the &quot;Short Bus&quot;
and the &quot;Mobile Photo Hut&quot; -- all co-ordinated on Amateur Radio
using simplex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous antics during the silly hour at 3AM.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This year, the GLS Marathon included these noble cachers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keith Watson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jimminie Crickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northernpenguin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chris-mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HomerJFong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fizbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carrgirl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geek-e&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MsKardiac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCCooperAgency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dreadnaught&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff-Trex&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 ( more updates to come )&lt;br/&gt;
The cache container is classified as a micro, as it is too small to
accomodate a pencil (bring your own!) or trade items. Geocoins will
probably fit though, and it is on the larger end of the micro
size.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains
instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those
yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time
you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are
relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will
always directly give you the required cache

[Puzzle Hint] Rainbows have seven colours. Indigo and Blue look very similar, but they are not. Indigo is a tiny bit darker than Blue.
[Cache Hint] Bouncy Bunny once had root canal.

It was damp inside so I wiped it out. Really liked the little caching kits with bandages, stickers and wipes. Took one. Left a geocaching pin and geocaching bookmark.

When I realized that the D/T combo was the last one needed to complete my Fizzy matrix...I was going if I had to swim. Besides....I knew this lake well from waterskiing here years ago, and knew the lake wasn't very deep. So....out comes my cheap Canadian Tire inflatable boat, and with a couple real paddles borrowed from Micd to replace the plastic ones that came with the boat...geob.o.b. &amp; I set out on the lake as the sun set. We had no luck keeping up with Micd &amp; F&amp;J, but managed to get to the shore of the island without any issues. After hunting down the &quot;Puslinch Lake&quot; cache, we decided that bushwacking to this one would be quicker than paddling the inflatable around the island. I'm not sure now that was the case, as the it was very slow going in spots. Once at GZ we quickly figured where the cache was, and though it was a bit of a reach, we were pleased to see it wasn't 25 feet up like so many other caches today. By the time we bushwacked back to our boat...it was totally dark out now...but the paddle back in darkness was a satisfying one...

Well the paddle was short but the find not so much. We searched for the better part of an hour before resorting to the Blackberry. Emailed the owner in hopes of a hint. Crystal mistyped and said there was 33 of us on the island instead of three.  I would have loved to see his face when he opened the email. Got no reply from the owner or the PAF we used, so off we went tot the next cache on the island. After hearing from Lisdowney we returned to GZ. It took a little more searching to locate and the cache was retrieved shortly after. Thanks for the help Arnie and Gerry.
Thanks for putting this cache out here. The co-ords are bang on and the terrain rating is well deserved.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;

Hmmm  Looks like a geocache, feels like a geocache, had trouble finding it like a geocache...  this is my first opencache find

I was here yesterday and had my first opencache DNF. Today I was not really planning on doing this but came back to map the trail for Northern Penguins Ontario Trail Project.   Once I finished I came back for another try and still could not find it so as I was heading out of bush admitting defeat for the second time I stumbled upon it

Thanks for the FTF prize.  Not often you can claim an FTF after 14 weeks

Just include your choice in your FTF log and the listing shall be updated accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area around the cache site can get &lt;b&gt;slightly swampy&lt;/b&gt;, so if conditions are wet, make sure you bring good boots for the last few meters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is on the ground but in an easily visible and fairly obvious hiding spot and so may still be findable in winter. However you may run into problems under &lt;b&gt;heavy snow cover&lt;/b&gt; (more than a meter or so).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bugspray&lt;/b&gt; needed in summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park is &lt;b&gt;closed at night&lt;/b&gt; between 23:00 and 06:00.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a pencil in the cache, but it hasn't been sharpened yet, so please either &lt;b&gt;bring your own pen&lt;/b&gt; or bring a sharpener.

Decided to leave a for a busy day, well as it turned out that was today. We needed a cache and there was little time to spare today. Started in a small park that looked promising buit ended up bushwhacking for a bit. The area was a bit swampy will be easy in a few days when everything freezes solid. Nice easy find once we reached gz.

parking coordinates. &lt;br/&gt; About the CC series: CC stands for Couch
Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains
instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those
yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time
you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are
relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will
always directly give you the required cache
coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Paula, Sue and Daisy are mathematical geniuses. They can do any
number of calculations in their head instantly. One day, they're
given the task of figuring out two numbers. Those two numbers are
in the range between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and they're whole
numbers (no decimal numbers). Both numbers can be the same
too.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Paula is told the &lt;b&gt;product&lt;/b&gt; of both numbers (one number
multiplied with the other), Sue is told the &lt;b&gt;sum&lt;/b&gt; of both
numbers and Daisy is told the &lt;b&gt;difference&lt;/b&gt; between the two
numbers (one number substracted from the other). However, they're
not allowed to tell those numbers to each other.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then, the following conversation ensues:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; I don't know the two numbers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sue:&lt;/b&gt; You don't need to tell me that, I've known that
already.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, in that case, I know the numbers now.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sue:&lt;/b&gt; Ok, I know the numbers now too.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daisy:&lt;/b&gt; I still don't know the numbers. I can guess one
number, which is likely to be one of the two numbers, but I don't
know for sure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; I know which number you're thinking of, but this one
is wrong. It's not one of the two numbers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daisy:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, then I know the numbers now too.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And that's it! :-D&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Believe it or not, it's actually possible to figure out the two
numbers. There's several different approaches to solving this, so I
cannot give any hints, as one way may be easier for some people but
harder for others, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Write the two numbers as 4 digits (add leading zeroes if necessary)
and call the smaller one ABCD and the larger one EFGH. (Example: if
the smaller number was 345, A would be 0, B would be 3, C would be
4 and D would be 5.)&lt;br/&gt;
N = G*G*G + B*D + C*E*F + (C+A)*G + G&lt;br/&gt;
W = C*C*D*H + (B+D)*(E+G) + D - H&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Ever dreamt of winning the lottery? Well, here's your chance!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You have just invented a device which allows you to retrieve pieces
of information from the future. Howver, it is still a beta version,
so you can only use it to get information about a week ahead of
time, and only a few small bits of information per week.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Since you always wanted to be rich, you instruct the device to get
you the lottery numbers for the next drawing of the 6/49 lottery.
Unfortunately 6 numbers at the same time is too much information
for the machine, and it just spits out an error.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Being a smart cookie, you try and ask the device for the &lt;b&gt;sum&lt;/b&gt;
of the 6 lottery numbers. The machine starts rattling, and voila -
spits out a piece of paper with a number on it. Looking at the
number, you start to realize your mistake: There's got to be
thousands of possible number combinations that yield this
particular sum!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Luckily the machine is also quite smart and feels your despair. It
starts working again and spits out some more information: It tells
you that if you figure out exactly how many possible number
combinations there are (from 6 out of 49 numbers) to yield this
particular sum, and then multiply this number with the sum on the
paper, it will yield a new number of around one million, and you
will also get the same number if you multiply all 6 lottery numbers
with each other.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After that, the machine went silent.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now you need to figure out those 6 numbers! Rest assured that this
is enough information to find a single set of 6 winning numbers for
the lottery.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
How to find the cache: Take the 6 numbers you got and call them A,
B, C, D, E and F, in ascending order (that is, the smallest number
will be A, and so on). Now some simple maths:&lt;br/&gt;
N = (C * F) + B&lt;br/&gt;
W = (D * F) - (A * B) + 1&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is at: N 43° 28.N' W 80° 32.W'&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can check your answer on the Geochecker: http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=1f7412188dda74babf59c16f34d59c20&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433152353042&amp;name=57696e20746865204c6f747465727921202d204343202331&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please re-hide the cache carefully the same way as you found it. At
times the area is highly muggled, so be careful!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

We spent some time searching the wrong area without success...and with the construction going on feared the worst A couple visits back to the vehicle to double check coords, consult a PAF...and still had no luck.  By now it was dark out...and we decided to try another PAF...where we got a bit more info that narrowed down our search area. It was still frustrating because the info could be interpreted different ways depending on the approach. After a good hour of looking we finally discovered the elusive cache.....
A very satisfying find.....
Thanks to Chrismouse and Northernpenguin for the help...
and to the cache owner for the challenge...

This is a difficult multi and will test your observations skills. A brand new Multi that will start with easy access followed by a short hike into the woods. You can either leave from here or take your car to the trail head. The round trip is a little under 2 KM. The trails are there but not wide and well groomed. You will need to have good footwear and it is likely wet in the spring and late fall. I am sure the mosquito's will be brutal in the spring and summer. 

You will need to use your stealth skills for Stage 1 and I don’t recommend trying stage 1 during school rush hours. 9AM and 3PM.

This is a MUST MARK your parking and trail heads. It is very easy to get turned around in here. I thought I had the coords wrong when I entered recently because it was taking me a way I didn't remember. Also the trees are blocking good satellite pick up so you may need to keep a PAF number handy. The hike near the final is guarded by thorn bushes and will probably be better in the winter. So put on your GPS thinking hats and let me know how I did. </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains
instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those
yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time
you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are
relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will
always directly give you the required cache

This is a small ammo box. No bushwhacking required. (If you take the right trail)
A new feature has been recently placed here that will make you want to linger. Be sure and bring some bug juice.

There are a lot of burrs in this area so be warned.  Also the trail in is better if you go to the bird tower first then walk in using one of the overgrown trails.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Dragon Cache to launch all Dragons.

The Dragon has been a recurring theme this year. I rode my bike to the Tail of the Dragon near the Smoky Mountain National Park. 318 curves in 11 miles. While in Atlanta I picked up Trogdor the Burninator travel bug.

Here is the original inspiration. Homestar Runner


Trogdor the Burninator
I decided to take him along for a ride and place in Dragon caches and eventually drop him in a Dragon cache in Ontario. While at a school here in K/W I discovered their mascot is a Dragon! Tip my hat to Williamsburg Public School. Come see the dragon cache sometime.
I tried to find one safe enough and big enough but to no avail. So here is an opportunity to launch Trogdor the Burninator Travel bug from Trogdor the Burninator Geocache. The perfect day is the annual Dragon Boat Races here in Laurel Creek.

I asked for approval and was granted permission. The cache is off the trail but not too far. I will post the park rules and please honor them. This includes the entrance fee. It is a small amount but goes to a worthy park and area. In the winter this is only accessible by cross country skis. No hiking to the cache in the winter when the snow is down.

Rules and current admission schedule are on the website but please note.
- Admission fee required at all times. (Honor system in place when gates are closed)
- Cross Country Ski on trails during winter when conditions allow. (No hiking)
- Enter via Gate only. No access allowed from the road. Trespassing charges can be issued
- Skis are available to rent when the gate house is open.

For more information about the parks search here.
Grand River C.A.

Laurel Creek Conservation Area.


Please have fun while here. The cache should not be considered a cache and dash. Spend some time and explore. I am sure you’ll love this area at all times.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache contains a Tim Hortons gift card with $2 for the first finder, as well as some tradeable items... Not too much exciting stuff really as this cache was a spontaneous hide, so please make sure you trade equal or up! There's some Euro coins in there for those who may collect them.

Good luck and have fun!

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The quest offers four challenges to those that seek MuggleScript,
the ancient parchment. It remains here, undisturbed in these woods,
as the developments of your modern world encroach upon this Olde
Forest. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is said that by visiting this place and inscribing your names
upon the parchment, that you will become immune to the gazes of
muggles. While you would be wise to leave this script to rest in
the darkness, there is a way to visit this place. Follow the Olde
Forest Road, and confront 3 challenges along the way, each
requiring a unique solution. Be warned: This is a long and perilous
journey that will take you into the wilds of the Forest.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Gatekeeper's Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You must first seek out the Gatekeeper of the Olde Forest Road.
From the posted coordinates, seek out the gate very close by, and
follow the orange eyes to the Gatekeeper’s home. His home is to the
left of the gate a short distance. Here you will be presented with
the first challenge. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Gatekeeper often gets bored, as many days will pass without a
single visitor to these parts. He has devised a way to amuse
himself while he is here. While he knows the Olde Forest well, he
is often amused by leading travellers astray. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You must be sure of your path before you set off on the next part
of your journey. All is not always as it seems. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Second Challenge: Night Vision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You next meet a band of Elves that camp in these woods.These Elves
live within a colony of Entmoot. They have the ability to
communicate with the Entmoot in a most unique way. It will be your
task to learn this language before you will learn of the next step
in your quest. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Third Challenge: Perseverance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Your travels will eventually lead you to the ancient Golems of the
deeper woodlands. These Golems are not fond of visitors at all -
many times they will remain perfectly still as to not attract your
attention. They WILL be watching you so take care not to offend
them. Nothing ruins the day quite so fast as getting slammed (in)to
the ground by an angry giant. If you are respectful, you may find
one of the Elders are willing to share the location of the
MuggleScript. These Rock Golems detest any type of noise, climbing
over them, harming the forest or clumsily waving torches around.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MuggleScript&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is vital that you carefully scribe your names onto the
MuggleScript and replace it precisely where you found it. Do not
attempt to take the MuggleScript with you, as a terrible curse will
be cast upon your party if the parchment is moved from its resting
place. If you remove one of the treasures nearby, be sure to place
another one in its place lest you anger the Forest Gods.&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: B11W3ZC - Stage 1 - The Beginning&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Small lock-n-lock tucked beside a boulder&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: B21W3ZC - Stage 2 - The Writing&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Small lock-n-lock in a rock pile.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: B31W3ZC - Stage 3 - The Golems&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Regular size container between large boulders&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: BF1W3ZC - FINAL Location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Small Ammo Box wedged between boulders.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: R11W3ZC - The Ent Council&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Reference point: Group of trees where players will be required to perform a projection.

Cachers use many things to help in their search. The attributes. The D/T rating. The container size. Previous logs. And previous experience of the cache owner's hides. It was this last one that had us all suspicious of the first Stage (only after searching for a while and returning to re-read). We all learned from this caching experience.  It was very well set-up and thought out. Without a doubt, one we will remember for a long time. </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Oh wow,  this was a stumper.  Our first clue that we weren't doing something right should have been how easy it was to find the first stage.  This is a BFL, it can't be THAT easy, and it wasn't.  We set off and searched and searched and searched.  We read the description, once, twice, maybe even three times.  It was decided that we should start over as it was felt we were missing something, and so we were!  Thanks to Treknschmidt and phone a friend!  Why does it seem so easy when you know what you are doing?  

Off we went on a bit of a walk.  The pines at night was pretty cool.  I really wish I could have taken a picture that captured the essence of what it was like to be there.  Stage two was found and the deciphering started.  We had to do a little work to get it right but what we really wanted to know was how do you plot this out in advance?  While working out stage three we saw some lights on the trail.  I thought we were a little odd being out at night hiking but these guys were on bikes!   Coordinates input it was off to stage three. 

This stage proved a little elusive. Searchers should pay attention to the note about getting slammed.  The Golems are serious about that.   Our newbie cacher, Fletchworks found this stage.  Bakers Dozen having learned from the first stage figured out what to do. 

The final required a bit of a hunt.  The great thing about going as a group is there are many eyes looking for the cache. 

Another wonderful BFL cache.  Thanks so much for organizing the event and placing some very inventive geocaches. </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one was quite the lengthy and time consuming night cache. Someone told us earlier in the day that it took their group 2.5 hours to do this one and we now understand why. Stage 1 had us fooled. Stage 2 took some time to figure out and still we were wondering. Stage 3 we pretty much gave up on after a lot of searching and searching in completely the wrong side, but then got lucky on our way back to the trail and found the stage in a totally different spot than we were searching, but we figured it out based on the description. Final had us searching once again and had to expand our search to find it. All 3 of our GPSes were atleast 10m off on stage 3 and the final. If it wasn't for a couple of calls to a phone a friend, then we would probably still be there there. Looking at the cache page now, I see that there are hints that we didn't even think of looking at while doing this one and that would have helped us greatly and probably saved us a lot of time. All 3 stages were definitely unique in their own way. This one took us atleast a couple hours.</groundspeak:text>

The highlight of the this one had to be a dozen or more cachers, sitting/standing in the middle of the woods, silent, with flashlights off waiting for something to happen..lol
And an added bonus...a group FTF!

While in the area a couple weeks ago, we discovered that there were no caches within a 7km radius of here, but yet lots of great pieces of land to hide caches, so hopefully others will find some great spots to hide their caches here too.

Looks like we hid this during deer hunting season, but didn't see/hear any deer, or any hunters, or any archers (see sign at trail entrance for more information).

Parking can be found at:
N43° 31.904
W80° 05.666

Cache is a clear 110ml (4oz) Tupperware container with blue lid (see picture). When placed it contained a nice assortment of pins. Located about 550 meters from parking area.

This may not be an easy find, or maybe you will be lucky. Try to do it without the hints. Please return the cache to exactly where you found it and leave the hiding spot as you found it too. Let us know how long it took you to find the cache? </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache itself is in good condition but &quot;outer&quot; container is now home to a colony of fire ants. I shook most of them out but it wont be long until they return to it. You should check up on this one Res.

Cache is not at the posted coordinates but within 4km.&lt;br/&gt;
There is no reason to even go to the posted coordinates as there is
nothing there.&lt;br/&gt;

Now stop sitting in front of the computer and go out and find some
caches. &lt;br/&gt;

Merry Christmas to all my bunniful friends. Why are you still
sitting in front of the computer, when there is tupperware or
peanut butter jars to be found. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The area where the cache is hidden has the potential to be
very swampy (wet!). When I hid the cache, there was no problem at
all walking around the area. There is a parking area just a few
hundred meters north along the road.&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm not 100% about the number we had, but I think it was #86.

Followed the rabbit tracks to the human tracks to the cache. Quick find actually, if you don't count the hunt for the card. This place would not be pleasant during spring thaw, and there was a couple points the ice wasn't quite up to holding me either but nothing more than a wee splash on my boots.

You will know how this cache got it's name when you find/smell the container. The difficulty is a 3 because there are no hints.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting spot where the road does an S turn. A bunch of
cedar trees have been planted here. Driving east I usually turn
north on Nassagaweya-Esquesing Town Line and drive by the forested
area.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAUTION: Please be aware that during
certain times of the year, there is Wild Turkey hunting (Spring)
and Deer Hunting (Fall) taking place on the Acton Tract. There is a
sign at the parking (posted coords) with all of the information.
During hunting season it is advised to wear blaze orange while in
the Acton Tract. Use common sense and play
safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if every BFL on Earth suddenly stopped
working? What if all light both natural and artificial would
suddenly be turned off...permanently! What if we lived in a world
where there was no light? All around us there would be total
darkness. No light, no colours, and no needs for us to have eyes.
Would our other four senses become more enhanced to compensate?
This is your chance to experience Life After BFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates will take you to the parking lot of the
Acton Tract. Here you will find several signs. You are looking for
the small one that says &quot;Acton Tract&quot; in the first line. Take all
of the numbers from this sign and assign them a letter. Ie the
first digit on the sign is A (=2), the 2nd digit is B and so on up
to the letter M (=1). There are 13 numerical digits in total on
this sign. From the posted coordinates, project a distance of H0D
meters at a bearing of EB6° True North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you start your walk down the trail from the parking area (or
you can take the easier route) and head right along the lesser
defined trail, you turn off all your lights, you close your eyes
(no peeking!) and head towards this geocache. You take each step
carefully in a world of darkness, perhaps with your hands out in
front of you to help maneuver around objects you may encounter. You
listen carefully to the world around you and listen even closer to
the beeps of your GPS. You use your inner senses to walk the
distance in total darkness to a cache you have never seen before.
How did you do walking in the dark with your eyes shut? Once you
arrive, you ponder in puzzlement and wonder what to do next as you
try and figure it all out. Be gentle and careful. Don't break
anything. If you break the stick, put another one in it's
place...there's lots lying on the ground around you. Watch where
you put your feet. Also, make sure you read the signs at the
parking lot about hunting season and pay attention to the hunter
platforms up in trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No tools or special equipment needed, which includes artificial
light sources, since after all this is Life After BFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;disclaimer: No BFLs were harmed in the placing of this
cache.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

didn't have high hopes for a FTF since we heard the group at Ultraviolet mentioning they want this one
not sure what the intention with this was, the package from the command center had the most important part of the instructions missing, but on the drive to the parking coordinates thebruce was inspired to check the cache description online and we got the needed information
we parked the car at the parking coordinates and we figured the truck that was there already was another caching group only to see two faces staring back at us when we shone the flashlights at the cabin, now that was creepy [:O]
we embarked on our walk to the coordinates and ooh my what a walk lol, between the swampy areas and the wood laying around, yeah managed to slip and lightly fall on my butt, we had quite an adventure
we tried the instructions on the sheet but no sound was to be heard....kinda questioning our sanity we noticed a fire tack but decided to proceed to the coordinates we calculated from the complete online description and found GZ 
before i knew it thebruce was up and we had a cache very soon and a blank log [:D]
now to get out, we decided to take the short way out to the road and bushwhack 
as we got out there were more cars parked closer to the header coordinates
still confused as to how this should have worked
finally made it to the car and surprise, surprise the truck with the creepy people was gone, i guess they thought we must be some bigger nut cases than them to be out there past midnight lol

I'm really glad I was with a group of smart and determined cachers when we found this one.  We followed-ish the instructions.  We got about half way to the cache and changed our minds.  Tried another trail and didn't like that so went back to the original plan.  

We got to GZ and found some firetacks.  Those through us off for a while until Kitten on the Hunt discovered something.  Some over thinking ensued before Andrew decided to retrieve the cache.  Luckily I was there to provide some needed support as Andrew returned from re-hiding the cache. 

Note to self - follow the instructions and don't over think things. </groundspeak:text>

Ontario. Also known as St Joseph Pioneer Cemetery.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The property for the cemetery and church was donated by Matthew
McCann and John Mulholland in 1856. Construction of the church was
started on March 18th of that year. In 1887 the congregation needed
more room so they bought a church in Acton which they renamed St
Joseph's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church building on this site was sold, torn down and became
a private residence elsewhere. There is a sign showing the location
of where the church used to stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lock on the gate is to keep vehicles out. There is a latch
on top of the gate to let people in.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is accessible either on foot or by canoe.  Either way expect to get your feet wet. Before attempting this cache please take note of the water conditions and use proper judgement. Do not scale the rock face directly to the cave! Coordinates will take you to the mouth of the cave.  Cache is located inside cave at the highest SW point at the back of the cave and has a rock in front of it to conceal it. Flashlight required.</groundspeak:long_description>

Dropped in under the bridge and crossed the cold stream with jeans rolled up. Spend a good 10 minutes inside the cave and only made the find when Geodad lowered a flashlight down to me. I also noticed the glimmer of the ceiling inside [:)] Great cache and nice hide. Thanks for the a wonderful and memorable adventure this morning [:D]</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">decided to got for this after a long week at work and what a treat
the canoe trip to the cave was indeed pleasant 
once we got close to the bridge it got quite shallow so we hopped out of the canoe and walked the last few meters, all good water was half way up my calf than i took the next step to the left and water was suddenly hip high and after next step was waist high lol...luckily the water was nice and warm
once we pulled the canoe on the rocks by the cave dfx jumped right in, while i was getting ready to take some pictures
when i pointed the flashlight in the ceiling looked like it was covered in glitter, no idea what that is but sure is beautiful
when first spot dfx checked didn;t turn out anything i pointed my flashlight around and there it was just a bit above where dfx was standing, although is not concealed by a rock as the description says
tftc and the adventure, excellent  job at finding such a great spot [:D]

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">this one was the main goal of today's trip, and what a different kind of after-work cache this was. the canoe trip was very pleasant (only our third time taking it out) and we arrived at the cave without major problems - we had to wade the last few meters, as the water was getting too shallow.

wasting no time, i crawled right into it, and wow, didn't expect it to be that big (relatively speaking), and it was sparkly too! i had to crawl around quite a bit to find the cache, and didn't see it until t4e was pointing me towards it, as i was concentrating my search on the wrong elevation. got nicely dirty too, but thankfully the water to clean myself was just outside the cave [:P]

while searching, i spotted something that resembled camo tape at first glace. at a closer look, it turned out to be a frog! just sitting there, watching me, not moving at all.

many thanks for this adventure [:D]</groundspeak:text>

I had it on my mind to do this cache today, so I made sure I took an extra pair of shoes with me as my intent was to walk across the water to this cache and that is exactly what I did...twice! I put on my old shoes, rolled up my pants to about my knees and had no problem crossing the water and it was below my knees in the deepest part. Once I got into the cave, Mr. Girls Phind Squirrels was already in there, so we chatted a bit and then headed out. This was definitely a memorable experience and I am glad we decided to do this one today. Later we passed by again after doing another cache and watched several canoers going for it and also the odd person wading through too like I did.</groundspeak:text>

As soon as I heard this was a cave that required a water crossing I knew I had to give it a go.  My caching partner Bakers Dozen was also up for it.  Off we went.  I forgot the flashlight and by the time I returned BD had already found it but was good enough to let me find it myself.  

So many geocachers were here today but not so many went for this one.  This was a great little cache, thanks!  </groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Captain Edward England&lt;/b&gt; sailed on the
&lt;i&gt;Pearl&lt;/i&gt; and his flag was the classic Jolly Roger. He differed
from many other pirates of his day in that he did not kill captives
unless it was absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This series consists of 7 caches. You will need to find the 6
treasure chests that have been hidden by these famous pirates and
collect the required information in order to find the secret
location of where Princess Theresa has taken refuge. Before
attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Pirates of Morovia - Princess Theresa (Final) for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each cache location you will find a treasure
chest. Engraved on the back of each treasure chest is a 3 digit
number which you should take note of. Also take note on whether the
treasure chest is open or closed. Do not remove the treasure chest
playing piece from the cache. For some added fun, when you log your
finds on this series, why not give your character a name and give
details of your character's journey throughout the area of Morovia
as you try to locate all of the chests that the 6 pirates have
hidden. The Princess likes stories and may have extra rewards
available for those that tell her the tales of their heroic
journeys. The Princess however does not understand pirate speak,
but she is very fluent in miffer speak, which is a common dialect
that is communicated among the people of Morovia.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

When asked for a location to hike, I remembered this cache out on the GRLT and suggested it. Just as the last time I was here in summer, I found a trailhead well hidden among other, more groomed (but private!) trails. This one sure could use a weedwhacker, even in late December. We found the cache where we expected it would be, knowing the cache owner from past hunts. Signed in, and put it back - carefully making sure the container is sealed, as a good snowfall could see this one unfound for some time! 

Thanks Res (and family) for giving me a reason to explore this section of trail some more. We eventually made our way over to the boardwalk section of trail on the west side of the nearby road and explored some side trails too. 

Happy New Year!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located within Rockwood Conservation area you will find numerous caves and potholes, a geological playground. This cache is located in one of the more difficult caves to get to within the park but will give you the true experience of &quot;caving&quot;.  The coordinates will get you to the mouth of the cave, which is an entry hole at ground level about 2.5ft in diameter.  You will be required to crawl through the opening for a distance of a few feet at which point the cave opens up into a fairly large room which you can stand up in.

There are a number of side chambers you can explore once you are in and the glittery ceiling will catch your eye.

You will need a good flashlight, and prepare to get dirty.  Protective headgear is advisable, since rocks on noggins can hurt.

Once in the main chamber the cache can be located on the left hand side of the wall furthest from the entrance.

Please do not do this cache alone, always cave with a partner.  

In order to get to the cave entrance, you can follow the trailhead at N43 36.694 W080 08.531 and follow the trail along the face of the cliff.</groundspeak:long_description>

The sign for location 1 is missing but I managed to get the info elsewhere.  Ran into Zorkmid at one of the locations.  Getting the date for location 13 wasn't easy in the dark.  Used a flashlight and a good point and shoot camera to do it.  Found the final quick and easy.</groundspeak:text>

Glad there was two of us with spreadsheets on our PDA's to solve this one - plus the other person using the more manual methods. Always feels good to have three sets of calculations agree before heading to the next stage. Used the wrong &quot;sacred&quot; stone at the end and had to go back for a recalc. Otherwise a nice find on a nice evening for a geocache!</groundspeak:text>

County.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This pioneer cemetery dates back to 1828. The land was donated
by Mr. McCormick who is rumored to be the first person buried here.
The cemetery was renovated by the Eramosa Council in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the stones have been moved to the display in the
center there are still pieces scattered around. One such piece is
visible near the cache location.&lt;/p&gt;

bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Here you will see two strange covered domed tubes that go into the ground and also two cubed type vents that come out of the ground. 

Multiply the amount of strange covered domed tubes by the the amount of cubed type vents that you see. This number will be X. Divide X by 10 and add that to both the north and west meaningless coords as follows to get the location of the cache.

We arrived just as the rainclouds were breaking up and the sun was just starting to show up. Perfect! The water flow was charged with extra runoff, yet it was dry enough to pull the cameras out. Did we ever. 

We were taking photos of the dam, the mill, the millpond, the gorge, rapids, multiple views of the waterfall, the potholes in the rock. Everything. Anything. Photographer's delight is what this cache should be named. After a good hour we remembered there was a geocache thing to do here so we stopped for 30 seconds to grab it and log it. Then it was back to business. Oh look at that viewpoint - gonna have to cross the river somehow... hey there's another cache on the other side ... so it continues. What great fun. May come back one night and play with off camera flash photography in here. What fun! I'd say we spent about 2 hours getting this one, when it could easily have been a quick grab'n'go.

No hidden agendas. Just some light hearted fun and adventure in this neat little world of this forest, that made it worthy of placing a well thought out and planned cache.

If you are lucky, you might see a deer and a couple of mini flying attack mice, as we did. And of course we won't mention anything about Gods, Christmas or Easter, as those terms seem to be frowned upon by certain GC approvers. This was originally intended on being a fun and adventurous cache, but since that was spoiled, just enjoy the area and take a moment to reflect on life and your surroundings when you find the cache.

Gilgamesh's Tavern&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ages ago, the evil wizard
Werdna stole an amulet that was very powerful. Through the ages,
many adventurers attempted to retrieve this amulet but only met
with grief. The current overlord Trebor has devised a test of sorts
to ensure that only the best of the best can go through the dungeon
and battle Werdna. He built a series of dungeons and mazes to not
only test out the adventurers, but also to enable them to build up
enough power so that they may defeat Werdna and bring the amulet
back to its rightful owners. Now head over to Gilgamesh's Tavern to
assemble your party and await further instructions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Gilgamesh's Tavern is dim and smoke-filled from the haunch of boar
roasting slowly over the fire. Small groups of adventurers talk in
low tones around deeply scarred wooden tables. Here is where you
hope to find a team capable of surviving the arduous rigors of the
Maze.&lt;/p&gt;

Catholic church once stood north west of Alma, Ontario. I know
little about the cemetery but will add details to this page as I
uncover them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice quiet area with some old headstones, mostly
dating between 1830 and 1880. You can still see the few remains of
the old church from the bricks scattered under the grass. Enjoy the
area while you're visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARKING&lt;br/&gt;
The best bet for parking is at the waypoint included with this
cache. This location is right beside the cemetery along the side of
the road. This shouldn't be a problem during the spring/summer/fall
seasons as a car can easily fit on the shoulder. I don't know yet
what it'll be like in the winter. If you have any problems with
parking, you can park &lt;u&gt;temporarily&lt;/u&gt; at the end of the laneway
of the property immediately opposite of the cemetery with the
property owners permission. They know of the cache and are friendly
towards respectful cachers. Do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; park in the
laneway/driveway of any other private property in the area. If this
doesn't make sense and you're in doubt of where to park, shoot me
an email via my profile and I'll clarify.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A travel bug trading post just north of Fergus along Highway 6 -
a popular north/south travel route. The location is at a ghost town
named Cumnock. You'll still find the town name on Google Maps and
associated with the 2 forests on either side of Hwy 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can easily accommodate a number of trackables so feel
free to drop any you picked up while traveling along the
highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like Ponsonby, Cumnock began as a stopping place on one of the
early pioneer trails. It was founded in 1852 by a James Samson who
emigrated from Scotland. With a partner, John Muir, they built a
hotel and named it the Red Lion Hotel. Later, Muir opened his own
hotel and named it the British Hotel in competition with his former
partner. Samson then added a store to his growing list of business
and opened the town’s first post office naming it after
Cumnock in Scotland. The village grew to include a blacksmith, a
cheese factory, a shoemaker, a flax mill, a sawmill, and a small
number of houses.


As the railroads came through the area, traffic along the roads
dwindled and the town began to decline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Churches Falls is located immediately east of the small village of Cataract in the Forks of the Credit Provincial Park.

The park provides a mix of forest, wide open fields and a smattering of ponds. The trail to the waterfall is relatively well signed and winds through varied landscape. You are treated to an excellent view of the falls from a large steel viewing platform perched on the side of the steep valley. Please remain on the viewing platform and the trail. Do no descend into the riverbed as it is very dangerous.

The waterfall itself has a caprock (layer of erosion-resistant bedrock) projecting well over top of the weaker rock layers below, which are formed where resistant sandstones and limestones of the Cataract formation have been undercut by the underlying Queenston shale. 

The rock face that can be seen on the opposite side of the river beside the falls displays an excellent contact between grey sandstone of the Whirlpool Formation and red shales of the underlying and older Queenston Formation. These layered sedimentary rocks were deposited in the ancient seas in the Paleozoic Era, over 400 million years ago, and form part of the Niagara Escarpment. The significance of the shale-sandstone contact is that it represents the boundary in Ontario of two geologic time periods, the older Ordovician and younger Silurian.

Waterfalls are important agents in geology and ecology.  Large amounts of stream energy are expended at waterfalls, resulting in significant erosion of large boulders sitting in stream beds.  However, it remains to be determined how effectively the bedrock itself is actually eroded.  Streams that flow through overburden (sand, silt, clay) are fairly active in moving and redistributing its &quot;unconsolidated sediments&quot;.  Streams that cross bedrock however, may actually have very little power to directly erode the bedrock, and processes like freeze-thaw and gravity may be more important. Waterfalls may be important to stream ecology by aerating streams that are lacking dissolved oxygen. On the other hand, they can represent significant barriers to the upstream movement of fish.  Long, gentle waterfalls like Sauble Falls or Burleigh Falls may still allow fish to move upstream.  Conversely, the many high plunge waterfalls found along the Niagara Escarpment are impassable to fish.

Waterfalls in Ontario have a wide variety of shapes and appearances and can be classified based in part on the physical process by which the waterfall is formed. The following are classification of various waterfalls that can be found within Ontario.

Cascade
This is the most widely encountered waterfall form.  The term is somewhat of a &quot;catch-all&quot;, because it encompasses a large number of falls in different locations.  It is most prevalent in the Canadian Shield, where the geology is more complex than that along the Niagara Escarpment.  The bedrock under a cascade waterfall tends to be more &quot;irregular&quot; than at the other waterfall forms (although a geologist would be able to sort it out). 

Chute
Chutes are similar to cascades, except that for much of the time, bedrock does not protrude through the water surface.  In addition, they are typically less steep than cascades, although there is no &quot;critical angle.&quot; Chutes are typically very swift moving waters that may (at least at some time) be navigated by a kayak or canoe.  

Plunge
Plunge falls occur where a strong layer of horizontal bedrock is underlain by a weaker layer.  Since the weaker layer is eroded faster than the hard layer, the hard layer begins to overhang the weak layer.  Eventually the overhanging layer is no longer able to support its own weight, and it breaks off and crashes to the ground.  Once this occurs, the weaker layer is subjected to increased erosion, a new overhang develops, and the cycle continues.  Before water was removed from the Niagara River for power generation, this process caused the Niagara Falls to move upstream about 1 m per year.

Ramp
In Ontario, this form is found almost exclusively on parts of the Niagara Escarpment.  Unlike plunge waterfalls, ramp falls do not have a prominent rock layer at the top that is harder than the underlying rocks.  The bedrock exists in layers, but since each layer is of similar resistance to erosion, they all erode at a similar rate.  This results in a ramp-like appearance, where the river never really looses contact with the rock surface.

Rapids
Rapids form in swift moving sections of streams.  The term is often used to describe stream beds that are choked with boulders and broken rock blocks.  It can also be used to describe where streams flow swiftly over bedrock, but without a definable &quot;waterfall&quot;.

Slide
At first, this form can be confused with the Ramp form.  The difference however, is that the water &quot;slides&quot; over one solid piece of tilted bedrock.  In Ontario, slide falls are rare, and are always found in the Canadian Shield area, since the province's younger sedimentary rocks are almost always horizontal.  

Trickle
Trickle Falls form where small creeks creep over the side of a rock face.  The creek is either too new or too small to have had any effect on the bedrock other than to remove vegetation cover.   Most trickles are very insignificant, but can provide very interesting subjects for intimate photography.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When I was younger we would go visit my mothers parents in Minnesota. They might have had a TV but I don't remember ever watching it. Instead I would go up to my mom's old room and read books that she had read as a little girl. My favorites were the Readers Digest condensed books. They had a very particular smell to them, not moldy or dusty just old.

I finished working in the new Rexall pharmacy in Sturgeon Falls today at noon and am leaving Toronto tomorrow morning at 7am so I had plenty of time to stop by and look for this cache. I was glad to see that someone had been down the trail since since it snowed in snow shoes and I had a nice packed surface to follow down the trail towards the cache. It was snowing lightly and the snow on the ground made it really quite and tranquil down in the valley. I had the foresight to bring the snow brush with me from the car to poke around in the snow. I was expecting it to be deeper than it was but it only came up to the center of my calves when I sank in while walking on the sides of the trail. I spent quite a bit of time looking at the multi trunk stump to the east of the cache and was about to call it quits when I moved to a different location and found the cache. As I brushed away the snow and duff away from the base of the tree trunk I smelled a familiar scent. I was transported back to my mothers room and the hours I spent up there reading Grandma Mac's books. As I sat there reminiscing the sun peaked out from under the cloud layer and bathed the woods in an amber glow before it set. I signed the log and proceeded back up the trail as the trees took on the violet and blue hues of dusk.

Thanks for some great memories and an enjoyable walk in the snow.

At the posted coords you will find a metal box with 3 letters on it. You must figure out what 4 digit number best follows these 3 letters.

Divide the 4 digit number by 10000 and add it to the following meaningless coords. Be careful that you do the math right.

After finding the cache, enjoy a nice walk through Mono Cliffs Provincial Park.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our very first cache was GCG5H5 McGowan Falls so it has a fond
place in our hearts. Since that cache was archived we thought that
this area deserved another as it is the only falls in our area
without one and it has a lot to offer. This is a fairly simple
multi with one offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the posted coordinates (stage 1) you will find the
coordinates for the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to explore the Riverview Trail west towards the
middle dam where you will find another swimming area, playground
and washrooms. The trail east leads into the Durham Conservation
camp ground with more trails and facilities. Pack a picnic, your
fishing poles and swimsuits, there are so many great spots along
this stretch of the Saugeen river!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a bit of history of the the falls from the SVCA site:
The area formerly known as the home of Edge's Mill, hosts a
spectacular falls which has been named McGowan Falls as atribute to
one of the historical pioneer families of Durham. Samuel and James
Edge came into possession of land along the Saugeen River in 1847,
which included the present day McGowan Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert McGowan bought the Edge property in 1888. The McGowan
family started operating &quot;The People's Mill&quot; at the falls, along
with other water powered mills on the Saugeen in 1888, which
produced flour, oatmeal and many other by products associated with
the milling of grain. Beginning in 1890, local electric power would
be generated compliments of this beautiful, natural attraction.
Tormented by flood and fire under the supervision of John McGowan,
the People's Mill perished. The flume and waterwheel deteriorated
and disappeared, but the dam, after extensive repairs, today serves
as a recreational and conservation flood control project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durham Conservation Area is situated in an ideal location,
nestled along a picturesque stretch of the winding Saugeen River.
It is also a leisurely trek from the heart of the Durham town
centre. It covers over 61 ha (150 acres) including over 3 kms (2
miles) of Saugeen River frontage. Scenic McGowan Falls is one of
the highlights of this beautiful park. McGowan Falls gorge is a
wonderful stop along the trail. you'll often see fishermen near
this area, angling for that prized catch in the cool waters
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail surface consists of a combination of gravel, grass and
hard packed earth and rock. For more information check out the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitgrey.ca/travel-experiences/waterfalls-and-waterways/waterfall-tour/&quot;&gt;Waterfall Tour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svca.on.ca/ca.php?page=durham&quot;&gt;Durham

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 4 stage multicache. At the first 3 stages you will find a
number for the combination lock on the cache. The posted
coordinates are for the final.

&lt;p&gt;This pretty little creek recently received a name due to the
efforts of a local family and their friends. Please read the
article in the web page link near the top. Bell creek crosses our
property so we are glad that it finally has a name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 3 stages are quick stops at various places where the
creek crosses the road. At each one you will find a number on the
sign post. Record these in order as they are the combination to
open the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice other signs where Bell creek crosses the road but
you do not have to stop at those. However at one of them I caught
the biggest speckled trout in my life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creek runs through some private property so please stay on
the road allowance except at the final which is on SVCA property.
As you approach along the river you may catch a glimpse of the busy
beavers working here or some of the other abundant wildlife. This
is near where Bell creek ends as it meets the Saugeen River. Your
ears will lead you to the best place to see the merry creek racing
down to join the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the final you are seaching for a small hide-a-key container.
Please ensure the cache is locked, scramble the combo and close the
cover over the dials after you sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;

You are hunting for a nano cache, a bison tube about the size of an
AA battery. You must roll the log tightly enough to fit back into
the lid before screwing the tube back on. There is road side
parking for one vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Durham Road Presbyterian, commonly known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cancemet/ON/ONS10961/&quot;&gt;Smellies&lt;/a&gt; Cemetery was founded in 1859 when the site
was granted by Reverend John McMillen and the church was built on
this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names such as McPhail, McLeod, McCuaig, McCannel, Smith,
Kennedy, Stoneouse, Campbell, McKinnon, McInnis, Clarke,
Carmichael, Stewart and Livingston can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;

enough to insert it back in the lid before screwing the tube back
on. Log date and initials only please. There is road side parking
adjacent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting this tiny village is almost like a trip back in time as
many of the original buildings from the mid to late 1800's are
still standing. Historical plaques have been placed on some of the
buildings to identify them. How many can you discover? Another
nearby plaque explains that Priceville was one of the last
remaining Police Villages in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

Within walking distance of the village is the entrance to an
extensive conservation area with delightful trails crossing a
creek, then meandering through forested areas that break into open
views of old meadows. Grey-Sauble, working with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theflesherton.ca/pdfs/walking%20village%20flyer%20small.pdf&quot;&gt;Walking Village Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, is currently
developing a figure-8 loop hiking trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a 3 stage multicache that will take you on a pleasant walk
to explore this peaceful forest. The posted coordinates are for the
first stage where you will find a tag with the coordinates to the
next stage and then the final.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We have enjoyed walking here with our dogs while observing much
flora and fauna along the way. Please take pictures and leave
nothing but footprints!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Was caching in the area with my wife, daughter, brook22 and hubcap33 today. This one was quite the adventure. We found the first 2 stages and then continued along on the trail towards the final, except the trail led us into a large pit so we went up the side and the trail disappeared so decided to go through the tall grasses and then as I was dragging our 2 year old daughter behind me in her stroller, suddenly my leg went all the way into a hole in the ground and the others said I disappeared. Lost my shoe in the hole and got it back out and we continued on our way and then came across the trail that led us to the final. After finding the cache we continued along the trail which took us quite a bit out of the park as we saw on our GPS maps. Eventually we found ourselves in some kind of workshop (?) area in the middle of the woods with 3 abandoned cars, tonnes of atvs and lots of other &quot;junk&quot;. We picked a trail that seemed to go where we wanted, but it zig-zagged, but eventuallyh we got to a trail that took us close to where we came in. What an adventure it was and we even lost a wheel to the stroller, one of 3 that we would lose today. I think we hiked about 3 times as far as we had to.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furry rabbits often make their huge eyes pop open seven
times. Each day carnivores or other rabbits discover several foxes
on low lands or watersheds that help each take refuge at illogical
locations. After nightfall deer face in northernly directions that
have every creature always confused. Here every animal takes their
healthy early special hunt eluding large trees. Every rodent often
needs yellow onions under rugged rocks incase giant hares
threaten.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
More (or less) about the cache:&lt;br/&gt;
--Difficulty/Terrain rating is simply the middle rating of each.
Cache could be easier or harder to find/get to, but I'm not
telling.&lt;br/&gt;
--Please examine carefully how the cache is placed before removing
it so that it can be placed back exactly how you found it.&lt;br/&gt;
--A mirror, tweezers, ladder, stool, rope, gloves, shovel,
flashlight, 2 litre bottle of water, paper clip might be needed,
but I'm not telling...no other tool/object should be required.&lt;br/&gt;
--You might need to use more than one of your 5 senses to find it,
and maybe even your brain.&lt;br/&gt;
--Cache is intentionally vague and non specific to add a bit of
frustration.&lt;br/&gt;
--Have fun and good luck...</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It's either on top, over, in, under, or below, but definitely at. Cache container itself is either touching or within an inch of touching part of the shelter.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;BOUNCY BUNNY is from
Ontario, CANADA. She is a RABBIT who even visited QUEBEC once. She
has many FRIENDS. Sometimes she likes to stay home, BUT THAT
doesn’t last long as she is always hoping to go out and hide
her next GEOCACHE. Kitty CAT who she HAD known for a long time is
her friend, as well as DUFUS DOG. You never know WHERE she is going
to hide a stash next.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bouncy Bunny Takes a Vacation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the stress of designing new, interesting and unique
puzzles, Bouncy Bunny really needed a rest. She needed to get away
from the hustle and bustle of geocaching and find a place where she
could be by herself and just take some time off. She wanted to find
a place that was quiet, had some nice scenery and was set back in
nature. She considered heading off to Europe, as she had never been
there before. In fact she hasn’t ever been outside of
Ontario, well except for those few days where she got lost and
accidentally wound up in Quebec. She was so lost in Quebec and
didn’t speak the language at all. She thought everyone in
Quebec spoke English just like the rest of Canada, but she was very
wrong. Even the other rabbits in Quebec ignored her, as they looked
down on the English speaking bunnies. So as soon as she figured out
where she was, she hopped onto a box car and left Quebec as fast as
she could to return to her home in the Greater Toronto Area where
she knew that others would respect her more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how could a rabbit find her way to getting to Europe? She
heard that the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) in South Eastern Germany
was very nice. Yes she definitely wanted to visit that area. Well
she was in luck, she had gotten a call from her old childhood
friends Kitty Cat and Dufus Dog. Guess who were heading to Europe
with their masters? However, Bouncy Bunny was a rabbit and she knew
she could never get onto a plane on her own. Her friends wanted to
help her, so they came up with a great idea. They made her a cat
costume. She looked just like a cat in it…well maybe a
strange looking cat. Meow she said, or at least tried to when they
were being checked in at the airport, but it fooled them enough and
she got onto the plane. Once in Europe, she stashed her costume,
said bye to her friends, and headed off on her own for a few weeks,
until they had to return back home to Canada. She had better not
miss the plane. It was a long ways off to the Black Forest where
she wanted to go. But she was a rabbit and could travel quite a
distance with her powerful hind legs. Boy what a crazy place
Germany was. Bouncy Bunny did not feel safe at all when she had to
cross the many winding roads and even worse, the autobahn where
cars drove like crazy, especially all those Mercedes, BMWs and
Audis. She had a couple close calls with death, but luckily made it
to her destination. She felt rather lost in the forest and was
getting a bit thirsty. She found a nice refreshing spring where she
cooled off and knew this was the place where she would spend the
next couple of weeks until she had to meet her friends back at the
airport. This was a nice place and even the people in the area all
seemed very nice. No one bothered her as she nibbled at the plants
around “her” little pool of water. It was like it was
her own little paradise. The perfect place she needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing she was curious about was that she was in such a
remote area, but yet every day it was always different people that
came to her nice little pool of water. Some of them even fed her
some veggies. She liked the carrots the best of course. Eventually
she figured out that this was a natural spring coming out of the
ground. She followed this spring for many kilometers until it
reached the Donau (Danube) river and then realized that she had
discovered the source of the Donau and named her little pool of
water the Donauquelle. A couple more days at her Donauquelle and
then back to the airport she went where she met up with her friends
again, dressed back up in her cat costume and headed back home to
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home however, she was very tired, probably due to
the long plane flight and all the hundreds of kms she traveled by
foot. She felt like she needed another vacation, to recover from
her vacation. Of course, even while on vacation, she still came up
with many new and wonderful ideas for puzzles, but she just has to
find some new places to hide her future stashes now. I’m sure
she will find them.&lt;/p&gt;

Some Climbing  involved for this cache. 

 I travel to this area frequently as we come up to the cottage often from may - nov for atv riding / fishing etc. 
This cache is meant for the kids as it contains swag  for them. It should be an easy find either by road or boat if you happen to pull up the local marina. This cache is winter friendly  and my gps was only 7 - 8 m accurate when placed. If you take something ... please leave something . Be Safe While climbing for this cache. 
Happy Caching.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Top of Ontario
&lt;p&gt;Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point in Ontario at 690m above
sea level. Compared to other mountains around the world, it is
rather low and not that steep, as the surrounding land in the area
is already quite elevated in comparison. A mountain is a large
landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited
area usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper
than a hill. The adjective montane is used to describe mountainous
areas and things associated with them. The study of mountains is
Orology. Ishpatina Ridge rises approximately 314m above the
immediate area (Scarecrow Lake). In comparison, the very top of the
CN Tower in Toronto sits at 633m above sea level, making the peak
of Ishpatina Ridge only 57m higher. The name &quot;Ishpatina&quot; comes from
the Ojibwe word &lt;i&gt;ishpadinaa&lt;/i&gt;, meaning &quot;be a high hill/ridge&quot;.
Spadina Avenue in Toronto is derived from the same word. At the top
of Ishpatina Ridge stands the decommissioned Ellis firetower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next highest mountain in Ontario is Tower Mt. at 679m. The
3rd highest is Ishpatina Ridge North at 677m which is in view of
and just a few kms away from Ishpatina Ridge. There is no higher
point of land for 525 kms to the south, 380 kms to the east, 1,430
kms to the west, and 1,600 kms to the north above the Arctic
Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the highest mountain on earth is Mount Everest
with an elevation of 8848m and the highest known mountain in our
Solar System is Olympus Mons located on Mars. It has an elevation
of 21171m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of Ishpatina Ridge is colder than the lower ground
surrounding it because the sun heats earth from the ground up. The
sun's radiation travels through the atmosphere to the ground, where
the earth absorbs the heat. Air closest to the earth's surface is,
in general, warmest. Air temperature is normally 1 to 2 degrees
Celsius colder at the top of Ishpatina Ridge than it is in the
surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishpatina Ridge is part of the Ontario Shield which is Canada's
largest physiographic area as it can be found in at least six
provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and
Newfoundland and Labrador) and two territories (Northwest and
Nunavut). It covers about two-thirds of Ontario and contains
Precambrian rocks that are more than 570 million years old. The
rocks are exposed or are covered by soils, peat, sand, gravel, clay
and debris from the glacial activity in the past. Glacial features
found in the Shield include outwash, eskers, moraine, kames,
whalebacks and drumlins. Glacial activity helped to form the basins
and paths for the many picturesque lakes, rivers and streams on the
Shield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused
by the watersheds of the area being so young and in a state of
sorting themselves out with the added effect of post-glacial
rebound. The Shield was originally an area of very large mountains
(about 12,000 meters) with much volcanic activity, but over
the millennia the area was eroded to its current topographic
appearance of relatively low relief. It contains some of the most
ancient volcanoes on Earth. It has over 150 volcanic belts (now
deformed and eroded down to nearly flat plains) that range from 600
to 1200 million years old. The current surface expression of the
Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the bedrock, with
many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe
glaciation during the last ice age, which covered the Shield and
scraped the rock clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have reached the top of Ishpatina Ridge, it is time for
you to gather the necessary information needed as follows in order
to log this virtual as found.&lt;br/&gt;
What object is at the very highest point of Ishpatina
Ridge and how did this object get here?&lt;br/&gt;

Nothing more fun than a bushwack through the Temagami wilderness...lol. Enjoyed 4 hours up top, climbed the firetower...and got some great pics. Looking forward to see if someone who wasn't at the picnic, actually makes the hike in again.

This cache is placed by a small rural church. Many of my wife's relatives are buried in the cemetery that is here. It is a beautiful quiet spot between old and new HWY 11.

Have a look at the quaint old concrete headstones that my wife's family (Turneys) had placed many years ago. They are slowly being replaced. The artist Michael Davidson has done a drawing of these stones called &quot;A Timeless Moment&quot;.

The cache container is a camouflaged 1 litre peanut butter jar.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located near my wife's childhood home. My kids love coming here and climbing the huge sand hills and running down. While you do not need to climb the hill to find the cache. I recommend that you do, because there is beautiful view from the top and it really is lots of fun going down.

This cache is a camouflaged 1.5 litre mayonnaise jar and should be winter friendly.

Depending on your vehicle, you may be able to drive closer to the cache than the parking location, but for a regular car, parking at the provided waypoint would be best.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A simple traditional cache located in a beautiful Northern Ontario Cemetery

The Goldlands cemetery is a beautiful peaceful location where some members of our family are buried. We love to go there and pick blueberries.

The history of this area is a bit tricky to nail down, but what I know is this.

The current location of the Goldlands cemetery was the former location of the community of Goldlands, which was burned to the ground in the Porcupine Fire of 1911 that decimated much of the area from Porcupine to Porquis Junction. The grave markers that were mostly made of wood were destroyed and the burial records were destroyed along with the church. You will notice that the area of the graveyard near the cache appears empty, but this is just because nobody actually knows where the graves are located in this area. I have never been able to find any evidence of the community in my explorations of the area.

There has also been a rumour that some gold was buried in the area and people have tried to find it for years. So far - no luck.

The cache is a camouflaged 1.5 litre mayonnaise jar and should be winter friendly.</groundspeak:long_description>
