Después de pasar por el puente de Vadocañas, en dirección a venta de Vadocañas, veréis una construcción un poco elevada de una casa en ruinas a la derecha. Iniciar ascensión por la parte izquierda de la ruina, entre una valla metálica que delimita una propiedad privada.
El geocache se encuentra pocos metros más arriba llegando a un pequeño balcón de piedra natural, tapado por un matorral de romero y piedras.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1900
the water tower was constructed in the Tudor style, with a turret,
slit windows and battlements. It is a striking orangey red colour,
and was built from locally manufactured bricks.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On 23rd August 1941, 8th August 1942 and 22nd January 1943 bombing
raids were carried out upon New Milton by the German Luftwaffe. The
town's water tower was suggested as the target.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a replacement cache for the original &quot;Grandpas Treasure&quot; cache. Slightly easier but you will still have problems with tree cover.

The cache is located in a small area of overgrown woodland, near to Grandpa Phillimore's house. If you spot him please be careful as his grandchildren don't call him Grumpy for nothing . The name of the nearby village &quot;Hordle&quot; is a short form of &quot;Horde Hill&quot; and refers to the hill now known as &quot;Golden Hill&quot;. The name is thought to derive from stories of pirate activity in the area and a cache of treasure buried in the hill. So... if you search very carefully you might find a second cache, but no clues for that one I'm afraid.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Although a lot of people notice St. Agatha's, probably on their way into the Cascades car park, I think very few take the time to have a look around the small gardens. They're a bit neglected, but especially striking in spring when the whole area is covered in cherry blossom. The cache is not accessible by wheelchair, but it's only a few metres from the path so prams and pushchairs are fine.

You're looking for a 35mm film canister. Cache contains just a logbook so bring your own pen!

St Agatha’s, Landport, is an historic church in the Landport district of Portsmouth. Originally situated in an area of extreme deprivation, today it stands proudly alone, the &quot;Cathedral of the car parks&quot; in the city’s shopping district. A magnificent building, it replaced a much simpler mission church. The church was built due to the inspirational leadership of Father Robert William Radclyffe Dolling, an Irish Anglo-Catholic priest whose social conscience lead him to fight against a range of domestic ills for his impecunious parishioners. At the same time he was able to charm astonishing amounts of money out of the wealthy residents of nearby Old Portsmouth. The inside was equally sumptuous but the intensity of the ritual lead to a row with the Bishop of Winchester. His successor Father Tremenheere continued to beautify the interior until 1914 when another long serving incumbent arrived. Father C.W Coles was to serve the parish through two world wars until 1954 when the last service was held. For the next 40 years it became a naval store until the Traditional Anglican Communion took it over for a form of worship very similar to that originally provided by Dolling. It is also used for concerts, but faces an uncertain future as its locale is developed as part of the &quot;Northern Quarter&quot; initiative.

Fun fact: the reason the outside windows are so high is that it used to adjoin other buildings - indeed, the trellis on one side can be seen to conceal these places.

Nice easy find, but the log is completely soaked and nearly full, just managed to sign the log.

Found it after a little searching during which I felt rather conspicuous with rows of traffic either side. I had been hoping there would be a seat near here so I could eat my lunch while working out where I thought it might be, but no such luck!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located on Tipner Marshes on a small patch of scrubland between the sailing club and the shooting ranges. Don't worry though; It's on the side furthest from the ranges! Cache is easily accessible although probably not wheelchair-friendly. There are a few brambles and stinging nettles around before you get to the coast but the footpaths are usually clear.

Bear in mind you do not need to pass through the sailing club to reach the cache.

This is an area that I've become quite fond of in the past year or so - a nice little piece of Portsmouth that few people seemingly bother with. Nearby are the Tipner Ranges and a school, as well as a sailing club.

There's a bit of interesting history to this area - an additional junction from the M275 was left unfinished. You can read more about this here and here and see photos of where it should have been here (check out the bottom ones).

The cache is a transparent lock-lid Tupperware container about 15x15x10cm. At time of hiding it contained a keyring calculator, a Spider-man pin badge, and a copy of Wanted as a treat for the FTF. It also contains a 27-shot disposable camera, so please take some pictures of yourself and of the scenery! The first two pictures are of myself and fellow cacher sciolilingua. Please mention in your log how many pictures are left on the camera!

Taken from Wikipedia:

&quot;Hilsea railway station is a railway station in Portsmouth, England with a limited service. It serves the northern end of Portsea Island, including a large industrial estate nearby.

It is located on the Portsmouth Direct Line which runs between London (London Waterloo) and Portsmouth (Portsmouth Harbour). There were extensive sidings at Hilsea during the Second World War.

This train station is mainly used by commuters who work in nearby Anchorage Park industrial estate. Only stopping trains stop here. This station is rarely manned, only in its peaked hours between 6 and 7am.

Historically, during the &quot;Battle of Havant&quot;, Hilsea was the terminus of an omnibus link from Denvilles Halt, just east of Havant. When the Portsmouth Direct Line had been constructed by the LSWR, at the request of the residents of Portsmouth, it was necessary that trains run from the Portcreek Junction railway triangle, to Havant Junction, along track owned by the rival LBSCR. The latter firm refused to allow that and engaged in militant obstruction of the track to prevent the running of a through train service for several months.&quot;

walk to the cache is on tarmac or hardpack paths. It will entail a
walk of approx 1km each way following the paths although you can
cut the corners across the grass if you want to. 
&lt;p&gt;Recommend parking is at N50.50.814 W001.09.325. To get there
take the road down past Cams Hill School (Shearwater Avenue) and
follow it all the way to the very end where you should end up in a
gravel car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is a cliplock sandwich box which is suitable
for smaller swaps only.&lt;/p&gt;

Ah ha! I returned for a second visit to grab this one after the clue reappeared on the listing page having been missing the previous day (Thanks Colin). I quickly located the cache, signed the log and replaced as found. The co-ords seemed slightly out on my GPSr but there are a lot of trees about. More dog walkers about today but I managed to retrieve and replace the cache in a lull. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

There are roads and footpaths which may be muddy in places. Take
your binoculars for the birds. While placing this cache I saw
little egrets, ducks, teal, brent geese and a curlew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a sandwich box 6&quot; x 6&quot; x 3&quot; wrapped in camouflage
material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the above co-ordinates and walk north to the signpost
and answer the following questions which will give you the
co-ordinates of the micro cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = The number of black sections/rings on the pole of the
signpost (between the bottom of the pointing signs and the
ground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = The number of red sections/rings on the pole of the signpost
(between the bottom of the pointing signs and the ground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = The number of pointing signs on the post x 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = The number of letters in the name of the lane on the sign
pointing South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = The number of letters on the sign pointing West +1&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on Wickham Common and can be approached from 2 different directions.  The choice of parking is as follows:
&lt;p&gt;1.  Approach the common from the B2177 road between Wickham and Southwick turning down the track opposite the Hundred Acres road. Parking co-ordinates are N50 53.640 W001 09.748.  The route to the cache is longer steeper from this side.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.  Alternatively approach the cache from Forest Lane parking at N50 53.421 W001 10.004 (This is also the parking for &quot;Wickham Wander&quot; so if you haven't already done it I recommend you do).  This is the shorter and flatter approach to the cache.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache is the usual ammo box chock full of goodies.  Might be a bit tough going with a pushchair and a bit of mud in winter or after wet weather.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Found it....well I spotted it first and then it took me a while to actually get to it without painfully damaging myself too much!

*Way* too many stingy &amp; spikey things around here!! :o/

Took Eraser, Left Bracelet.
Dropped off Chuffy Jr. TB to make friends with the horses in the nearby field while he's waiting to be picked up!

Thanks! :)</groundspeak:text>

No joy, but the Dakota found it easily as being one of Nobby's we knew the co-ordinates would be spot on.  By now Ricky disappointed there were so few dogs around, but we found plenty on the way back to the car.
Thanks Nobby, for the new experience!  Not sure I can get to grips with the whole Awesomeness thing tho'.

The area is quite muddy in parts with a few short slopes to walk up or down. Possible with a pushchair with a struggle.
The cache itself is a lock lock style container clearly marked containing some swaps. Also I've included a Munzee ( see www.munzee.com) for all the smart phone users to claim.
Please note that this cache has been placed in accordance with the GAGB agreement with the Forestry commission. No night caching is allowed and you should be aware of the local bye laws.</groundspeak:long_description>

We walked through from the top of the hill at Piper's Wait, but used the Munzee coordinates as Open Caching appeared to have removed the three &quot;Nibbles&quot; (finally logging this two days later).   I guess we can amend the Terrain rating as the long dry spell is coming to an end and the mud is returning, but the tree cover still defeated my smart phone GPS.  Not sure on &quot;Awesomeness&quot; rating, I'm sur e &quot;Fine&quot; (in English) is equivalent to something &quot;Volcanic&quot; in Garmin.Inc
Had expected to see a few deer, but very quiet today, although the autumn colours made it a delight and Ricky enjoyed chasing the leaves.

Vernon Hill House, which stands north east of Bishop’s Waltham on the hill of the same name, dates from the late 17th or early 18th century. It is named after Admiral Edward Vernon (1684 - 1757) and it is thought that he built it following the capture of Porto Bello . Later, Ralph Waldo Emerson the American philosopher and poet visited

Stoke Park is a beautiful woodland located at the heart of Bishopstoke and Fair Oak. It is a mixed woodland which includes many different tree species, from the easily recognisable Oak and Beech to the less well-known Wild Cherry and Japanese Larch. Due to the variety of species the trees from this wood could be used as many things such as telegraph poles, boats, oak barns, tables, fences and firewood.

The Woodland covers 99 hectares (244 acres) and has an interesting landscape including valleys, streams and attractive views from the northern edge across the adjourning farmland.

The Wood is full of interesting wildlife some of the more common animals you may either see or find evidence of are fallow, roe and muntjac deer, foxes, rabbits, bats, reptiles, butterflies and many species of birds. Look up and you might be lucky enough to see a Buzzard or Kestrel!

I had good fun locating a spot for this. It should be pretty easy to get to, although the paths and wooded area can become boggy when it rains. A favourite for muggles and their muggle-type dogs, so beware. Thankfully the spot itself is pretty well hidden amongst the undergrowth off the path.

When setting up this cache the countryside was very wet and muddy so be warned, my advice would to wear Wellies or really good walking boots and gaters if you have them, but dont let this dampen your spirits as this is a lovely walk.

The walk should take you approximately 1 and half hours and the distance is about 3 miles.

To make it easier im giving directions at certain places.
1.After parking at given co-ords head south along the road till you see a sign on the left to the cemetry turn left here and this will lead you to the first bison micro.
2.After finding the first bison micro come back through the gate and turn left and head towards the farm, once at the farm you should see the farmhouse to your left just after this turn left this will lead you towards micro 2
3.After the second bison micro go over the stile and follow the footpath even though the arrow shows you to go left and please keep on this footpath as it will take you to the cache finally, if you have dogs with you at this point please keep them on leads.
4.after third micro head straight across the field over the very muddy stile then cross the country road and go through next field and past the houses until you reach a small wood on your left hand side and enter here.
5.After the fourth micro rejoin the path and head downwards to the kissing gate, go through then take the left path and head towards the big pylon and across two bridges..

The rest is history hopefully

Happy Caching

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a fairly easy to find cache with the aim of taking you to a
great location with fantastic view of Cranbury Park a forma home of
Sir Isaac Newton. Happy hunting in this great little
area. &lt;br/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;You must
&lt;strong&gt;only repeat only&lt;/strong&gt;
approach this cache from either end of the footpath that runs
across the Cranbury estate.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The best approach is from the Otter Pub at &lt;strong&gt;50°59.913'N,
1°21.226'W&lt;/strong&gt; they have a large car park at the rear of the
pub. I am sure if you just let them know you will be popping back
for a pint after a quick walk, they will not mind you parking in
their car park. There are however a number of other small parking
space around this area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 You could also start by parking at the Church at
&lt;strong&gt;51°00.155'N, 1°21.034'W&lt;/strong&gt; at walk up the hill
visiting Virtually a Cache ( GCE5EE ) on your way to Dib Dib
Dib.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As a third option you could start the walk from the Ladwell end
&lt;strong&gt;51°00.796'N, 1°23.343'W&lt;/strong&gt; of the footpath. There is
just about room for one car to park as long as you do not block of
assess to the gate. This is an ideal start if you can be dropped
off and walk across to the Otter pub some 3.7km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbury Park map link here&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The cache is a small plastic container with a number of small
items and log book in place, small swaps only please. As noted
previously the aim of the Dib Dib Dib cache is to bring you to a
great area that is almost a secret to many who live in the
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the
History of
&lt;b&gt;Cranbury Park, Hampshire&lt;/b&gt; by Michael Ford.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; C R A N B U R Y&lt;br/&gt; P A R K&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Home of Sir Isaac
Newton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year Cranbury Park, South of
Winchester in the Parish of Hursley, opens its gardens to the
public for their enjoyment and for the support of various
charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visit on a nice day, as it was
this year (1999), is a delight. Unfortunately the house is not open
so its magnificent interior cannot be seen, which is a shame as
Pevsner describes it as an 'unforgettable experience' to behold the
hall with its coffered tunnel-vaults to the full height of the
house and the beautiful ballroom. It is however possible to arrange
a bed and breakfast stay as guests of the owner Mrs
Chamberlayne-Macdonald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is built in a very red brick with stone
     dressings. The entrance is through a porte-cochere either side
     of which are large columned windows with roundels in relief
     above each and above the porch. Balustrades surmounted by urns
     run around the parapet, framing the whole house to give a very
     pleasing prospect within the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house we see today was built in
1780 for Lady Dance-Holland the wife of Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland
the painter and the brother of George Dance who is believed to be
its architect. Cranbury Park, before this time has an interesting
history as the home of Sir Isaac Newton, England's great
philosopher, during his latter years, until his death in 1727. One
of his former pupils, Jonathan Conduitt, married Sir Isaac's
half-niece and adopted daughter Catherine Barton in
1717.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his death
     the property was bought by Mr Lee Dummer and it was a Dummer
     who purchased medieval masonry from Netley Abbey for his
     collection of historic monuments. Today in the grounds can be
     seen these fragments which he had re-erected in the 1760s,
     some being incorporated into a picturesque tower with the
     others forming a wall of arches taken from the North transept
     of the Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chamberlaynes came to live at Cranbury Park
     around 1800 and are still in residence. The pleasure grounds
     were laid out in 1815 and are thought to be by Papworth. The
     sundial in the garden displays the Conduitt coat of arms and
     was calculated by Sir Isaac Newton himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The
Garden of Cranbury Park is normally open for one day only in June.
Enquire locally for details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I parked near the Otter pub and walked over the noisy M3 motorway. It was nice to hear the sound of the motorway diminish as I made my way to the cache location. My GPSr pointed to an obvious hiding place, so I put my had in and startled both myself and the occupant! I then realised that, although I had an up to date cache print-out, my GPSr hadn't got the updated coordinates. So I put the correct ones in and found the new location straight away. I must say both the old and new locations were excellent hiding spots.

Thanks for bringing me to this interesting place.

The Story of the Monarch's Way is that it was use in the escape of
Charles II after the Battle of Worcester in 1651.&lt;br/&gt;
For six exciting weeks, and hotly pursued by the Parliamentary
forces under Oliver Cromwell, he travelled first north, then south
through the Cotswolds and the Mendips to the South Coast, and
finally along the South Downs to Shoreham where he made his escape
to France. Loyally supported by his followers, many at great risk
to their own lives, he was given shelter in places both great and
humble, many of which still exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details about this long distance path, which is some 615
miles long, can be found at the following links.&lt;/p&gt;

Hursley grounds (not inside). &lt;br/&gt; The cash is named after John Keble (25 April 1792 – 29 March 1866)
was an English churchman and poet, one of the leaders of the Oxford
Movement, and gave his name to Keble College, Oxford. 
&lt;p&gt;In 1835 he was appointed Vicar of Hursley, Hampshire, where he
settled down to family life and remained for the rest of his life
as a parish priest at All Saints Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Shakespeare has done for Stratford-on-Avon - John Keble has
done for Hursley. But on going to Hursley one also finds, linked to
the same locality fascinating associations of historic characters,
such as &quot; Tumbledown Dick &quot; Cromwell, Thomas Sternhold, Sir Isaac
Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hursley is a typical English village, and the records of the
centuries of their history are of the kind that go to make the
history of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Keble died in Bournemouth at the Hermitage Hotel, after
visiting the area to try and recover from a long term illness as he
believed the sea air had therapeutic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you're searching for the nano cache you will see close by
John Keble’s and his wife’s graves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house that Keble used to live in can be found just behind
the church. The local school is also named after Keble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a book called &quot;All Saints' Church, Hursley -
History and Guide&quot; by Stan.C.Rawdon, unfortunately Stan died last
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can park close to the church, follow the road that leads up
the side of the Parish Hall and you will see parking at the rear
entrance to the church. You can remain parked here for the final
hunt also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE When looking for the final cache approach from the park
gate just in front of the village hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see more about Hursley at the village website
http://www.hursleyvillage.info&lt;/p&gt;
NOTE : Please carefully put the NANO back in the same
place.&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: K121QJJ - Kebleland&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Last year, I placed &quot;Itchen to get back to the Pub&quot; (GCMJYQ) for the 2005 Winchester Late Xmas Cache Bash.... so THIS cache got placed for the 2006 bash!!! And , of course, everyone who came along wants to be able to log it!

Not too surprisingly, it's not all that far from last year's, and if you plan to do BOTH, then I'd recommend doing GCMJYQ *FIRST* and *THEN* do this one! In both cases, you should start from the public path, just opposite the Cart &amp; Horses pub in Kingsworthy.

Unlike lst year's cache, which had one bit that was rather a stinker, thus one is really simple... it would have been a 1/1 but for the fact that a large part of the track is rather narrow and muddy, and not at all suitable for *anything* with wheels on.

Please cover the cache well when you replace it.

If you walk on another couple of hundred yards, you'll come to the two bridges that take the A33/A34 over the River Itchen. This is the &quot;Three Castles Path&quot; that follows the southern side of the River Itchen from the Abbots Worthy area down to WInchester.

Another cache, now called &quot;A Tiny Itchen&quot; (GCTA70), was placed as a &quot;bonus cache&quot; to this one, at the 2006 Cache-Bash. It's only 3 or 4 minutes walk up the path, by the bridges mentioned above, so why not do it after you've found this one? </groundspeak:long_description>

This turned out to be a bit of a long way round, but it made a nice circular walk by returning via the Basingstoke road. Found the cache quickly, I like caches like that!
Thanks for another excuse to walk round here.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a multicache (part virtual, part physical) that takes you over / along part of the Itchen's meanderings. Wellies or similar are suggested in wet periods, although much of the path is fairly ok. The total walk (there &amp; back) is a little over 1km, and should take you about 45 minutes to an hour.

This cache not really suitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs, as many bits of the paths are quite narrow or uneven.

The coordinates given for the cache are for the first clue: there is a small layby about 50 yards towards the junction, with space for a couple of cars. You'll also spot a pub just over the road!

After the first location, you need to cross the A33: whilst this is often quite quiet, cars travel very fast, so please take care when crossing the dual carriageway, especially if you have children. 

A signpost clearly shows where the footpath continues.

1) Go to N51.05.378 W1 17.751
Look for a sign that tells you “Unity is Strength – 188A”

A =

2) Go to N51.05.379 W1 17.392
On a sign, you will find that the “Site Reference” is “10B27C”

B =
C =

3) Not far away, at N51 5.349 W1 17.380 you will find a sign, explaining that this specific area is an SSSI: but how many times does the letter “v” appear on the sign?

D =

4) Go to N51 5.163 W1 17.400 Add together the number of vertical wooden posts and the number of fingers on the signpost

E = 

5) Go to N51 5.193 W1 17.327 where you will find a micro-cache with the next instructions!! Here's a bit of space to take notes in....

6)


7) Somewhere you're gonna find:

F =


** The final cache is a small ammo-box **



*** NOTE - IMPORTANT ***

The clue in the micro (at location 5) needs a little bit of clarifying:

If it is reworded along the lines of &quot;.... that are *immediately* to the right of....&quot; (ie within a metre) then you should find things more obvious. </groundspeak:long_description>

Parked by the church just up from the pub.
Fun gathering the clues on route, a lovely walk too.
Especially enjoyed walking through the cottage garden over the bridge - what a beautiful spot.
We got a bit muddled at one stage.  Because we counted a clue incorrectly, we calculated the final cache over the river some 150' away [:O]
However, after re-reading the clue and recalculating, we headed off down the path a short way and located the cache without further difficulty.

The only TB in the cache was Scavenger Hunt Tiger.

 &lt;br/&gt;        

&lt;br/&gt;
 The Torpedo Shed, Worthy Down Camp, Winchester, Hampshire.
National Grid Reference: SU 47006 35535&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Parking&lt;br/&gt;
 There is plenty of parking at 51°07.090'N,
1°19.562'W just as you enter onto the playing area. This is
a fairly busy area for dog walkers, runners etc so you might need
to keep your wits about you when visiting both the micro and final
cache.

&lt;p&gt;Starting this
cache&lt;br/&gt;
 There is a tricky micro cache to start you off
with. This can be found at: 51°06.998'N, 1°19.939'W. On
your way to the micro you will see the area where the Torpedo Sheds
once stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the details from the micro it will
take you on a short walk past other remains of the Torpedo Shed
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should find the final cache without any
problems, after which it will be a short walk back to the car
park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for placing this cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. There is a lot of history around this area, in
particular the Torpedo Shed (see full details below)&lt;br/&gt;
 b. There is a great and very well kept play park for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to the Torpedo
Sheds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


The MOD had been asked by
Hampshire Constabulary to take action to prevent&lt;br/&gt;
 vandalism and unlawful entry to the former Torpedo Shed at Worthy
Down Camp. MOD&lt;br/&gt;
 surveyors had indicated that the building is beyond economic
repair and no alternative&lt;br/&gt;
 use can be found. The structure was to be collapsed in on itself
and the rubble buried by&lt;br/&gt;
 the spoil from the surrounding earth bund banks. This was
completed by the end of&lt;br/&gt;
 March 2000.

Context One Archaeological Services (COAS)
carried out an archaeological building survey at the Torpedo Shed,
Worthy Down Camp, Winchester, Hampshire (SU 47006 35535) between
24-25 March 2000.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The historical importance of this building at regional and national
level is unknown. However the building is comparatively early in
the history of military aviation, being pre- WW2. In addition it
does not appear to have been altered and many of the internal
fittings survive. It is certainly a building of local importance
and therefore it is considered necessary to produce an archival
record in advance of its imminent demolition.'


&lt;p&gt;Site Location and
Topography&lt;br/&gt;
The Torpedo Shed occupies gently sloping ground on the northern
edge of the former Worthy Down Airfield, just south of South
Wonston at NGR SU 47006 35535 (Figure 1). The site is bounded to
the north by South Wonston Playing fields; 500m to the south-east
is Worthy Down Camp, and Race Course Cottages lie 300m to the west.
The Torpedo Shed lies approximately 90m above OS Datum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site covers an area of 550 square metres and
lies within a network of military storage depots and access routes
around the northern perimeter of the former Worthy Down Airfield.
To the east of the Torpedo Shed lies a former components shed
(AM1817/34), which has now been filled for health and safety
reasons, and a former fusing shed which was once linked to the
Torpedo Shed by a track (1503/AA1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical
background&lt;br/&gt;
 In 1917, 480 acres of the Old Winchester racecourse were developed
into an airfield as part of the military camp at Worthy Down. Six
aeroplane sheds were erected together with a large hangar. The
airfield was first used by the Wireless and Observers School in
1918, but the armistice brought their residence to an end. In 1924,
the site was re-activated when '58 Squadron' used it as a base for
'Vickers Vimy' aircraft. This squadron was soon joined by 'No. 7
Squadron' with 'Vickers Virginias'. 'No. 7 Squadron' stayed and
received the 'Handley Page Heyford' in 1935, before being joined by
No. '49 Squadron' and the 'Hawker Hind' bomber. Between 1926 and
1935, there was a gradual build up at the airfield. Married
quarters and new administration blocks were erected. In 1936, the
airfield was transferred to 'No. 2 Group, Bomber Command'. The
bombers left in 1938, and 'Avro Ansons' arrived in their place
(Brooks 1996, 143). The airfield was transferred to the Admiralty
in 1939, becoming HMS Kestrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luftwaffe bombed the airfield in August 1940,
unaware that it was a training base. It was the only attack the
base ever suffered. The airfield became one of the hosts to the
'Supermarine Spitfire' during the Second World War, after its
primary base at Eastleigh endured regular enemy bombing raids. Many
of the early trials of the 'Seafire' were also carried out at
Worthy Down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMS Kestrel closed in November 1947, re-opening in
June 1952 as HMS Ariel. This ground training establishment closed
in 1960 when it was handed over to the Royal Army Pay Corps who
still operate the site (Brooks 1996, 11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The archive&lt;br/&gt;
 The archive consists of two copies of this report, colour
transparencies, monochrome prints and negatives, and an electronic
report with a digital image library on CD-ROM. This has been
deposited with;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The
Wittenham Clumps or Sinodun Hills are a pair of hills in an area of
outstanding natural beauty and well worth a visit for the lovely
views, as is the old village of Dorchester on Thames at the bottom
of the hills. The cache is an easy walk of about 0.5 mile from the
car park (N 51 37.640, W 01 10.890), although it can get a little
muddy in winter. It makes a nice spot for a picnic in the summer
with a small picnic area adjacent to the car
park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst
their why not take a walk around the clumps and pay a visit to the
Poem Tree. In 1844 Joseph Tubbs was so inspired by the beauty of
the clumps that he carved the following poem on the Poem Tree. The
tree is now dead but the poem can be read on a plaque nearby the
tree on Castle Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As up the hill with labr'ing steps we
tread&lt;br/&gt;
Where the twin Clumps their sheltering branches spread&lt;br/&gt;
The summit gain'd, at ease reclining lay&lt;br/&gt;
and all around the wide spread scene survey&lt;br/&gt;
Point out each object and instructive tell&lt;br/&gt;
The various changes that the land befel.&lt;br/&gt;
Where the low bank the country wide surrounds&lt;br/&gt;
That ancient earthwork form'd old Murcia's bounds.&lt;br/&gt;
In misty distance see the barrow heave,&lt;br/&gt;
There lies forgotten lonely Culchelm's grave.&lt;br/&gt;
Around this hill the ruthless Danes intrenched,&lt;br/&gt;
and these fair plains with gory slaughter drench'd,&lt;br/&gt;
While at our feet where stands that stately tower&lt;br/&gt;
In days gone by uprose the Roman power&lt;br/&gt;
And yonder, there where Thames smooth waters glide&lt;br/&gt;
In later days appeared monastic pride.&lt;br/&gt;
Within that field where lies the grazing herd&lt;br/&gt;
Huge walls were found, some coffins disinter'd&lt;br/&gt;
Such is the course of time, the wreck which fate&lt;br/&gt;
And awful doom award the earthly great.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite being a wet, cold and fairly windy day, the car park was almost full at 0930.  A VERY muddy, 10 minute walk to the cache.  Located quite easily, after approaching from the 'correct' side.
0955 hrs -  Cache well covered, dry and in good condition.
Took dice game, left book of comical postcards.  The cache camera is on 'E'. SL.

The two larger hills (Castle &amp; Round) are useually known as the Wittenham Clumps although they have been known in the past as the Berkshire Bubs and Mother Dunch's Buttocks. This clump of trees are sometimes called the Cuckoo Pen, the locals believed that if you could trap a cuckoo within its branches, summer would never end. This was to be the location of out first Geocache but unfortunately at that time these woods were not open to the public so the cache was placed on the nearby Castle Hill. Whilst revisiting the area on a maintance visit we found that these woods have now been opened so took the oportunity to place a small cache we happened to have on us.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Carfax Tower is the remains of
the church of St Martin which was demolished in 1896 in order to
widen the road and improve traffic flow. The tower was renovated
following this and visitors today, for a small charge can climb the
99 steps to the top of the tower which offers some wonderful views
over Oxford. There are two figures known as “quarter
boys” on the front of the tower that strike the quarter
hours. On the second floor of the tower is an exhibition on its
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a magnetic
micro placed in a very busy part of Oxford so stealth will be
required when retrieving and replacing this cache. The magnet is
seriously strong, so if you can't remove the cache you'll have to
log a DNF. Do NOT try to slide the pot off the magnet as you'll
break it.&lt;/p&gt;

Were it not for the pits, Headington Quarry village would be situated on a featureless plateau: instead it is built in a rabbit warren of hollows and waste heaps that have given it such charm that it has been designated a conservation area. The cache is hidden in Quarry Hollow Park dug by the Headington quarrymen starting in 1396. It is a magnetic nano cache hidden a few inches above ground, bring a pen or pencil.

!!!  MUGGLE CENTRAL  !!!

Please be careful when signing the log as the tiny magnet can fall out of the container. Please let me know if the magnet can't be found.

If you are approached by the local ferrel youths at the GC, please take the cache with you and either return it later, or drop me a message saying you've removed it. This might reduce the number of times I have to replace it.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache has been hidden just around the corner from one of the best asparagus farms in the county. The season is short running from mid April until the end of may. If you have never tasted freshly picked asparagus you really should try some. It's far tastier and a lot cheaper that the supermarket stuff.

This is De Boyz Snr's first cache so he is particularly proud of this one. Is a small official Geocaching click top container in a camo bag.

Nearest parking is to the side of the road opposite the first turning to North Leigh heading out of Witney.

Many thanks and please enjoy!

Walked on from &quot;Can Rabbits Climb Trees?&quot;. As the path seem to go across a crop field but no signs of it, I went round the edge.

Peaceful at cache site with the sound of bird song in the wood :) No problem finding the cache and duly signed the log.

I then used the bridleway to get back to my car, making a nice circular walk.

As there are no other logs on this site for this cache, it looks like a FTF.

Will OpenCaching catch on?

This is our very first cache and De Boyz Jnrs special one. Don't ask me about the title, that was his idea but as he wrote about where it is 'I'm next to a gate, see lots of cars, buses and lorries and have lived here for many, many years'.

Closest parking is a little up the road opposite the first turning for North Leigh going away from Witney.

Entering the field via Brick Walk, go to the wooden stile to the left of the field, don't cross it. Near to here you will find a gap in the hedge that you can get through. After you're through the gap then there is no undergrowth and you can stand up.
You are looking for a small yellow container. It could hold some VERY small TBs.

This cache is placed on the boundary of Floyd's Field, (you can park for free). It is placed near the far side of the field from the parking area. 

 The cache is a clip-lock design and is partly buried at the base of a tree, so it's probably easier once found to leave it in place, remove the lid and take a look inside (either that, or take a spade with you!!

Muggles often use the field as there is a small play area in one corner and space to play football, so some stealth may be necessary.

On placement there are various &quot;swag&quot; items inside. Feel free to swap these with items of similar or greater value, but please mention what you took/left behind when you log your visit online.

Please also remember to fill out the log book.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As World War 2 approached Britain needed new airfields and the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works began to look for land. Bitteswell was identified as a suitable site and in 1940 construction on the airfield began.&lt;br/&gt;In June 1941, the airfield opened despite there being no water or electricity.  Local residents in Bitteswell and Ullesthorpe were angry that their quick route to the A5 had to be closed as it crossed the airfield.Eventually water and electricity were installed and on 12th August 1941 the first night flight took place. However as the weather worsened with the onset of winter the grass runways became dangerous and flying was suspended.  Flying resumed in April 1943.&lt;br/&gt;By 1946 the company Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Ltd had begun to make and test aircraft on the site. In the 1950s the production of aircraft had grown so much that Lutterworth residents began to complain about the noise. In 1956 Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft bought the aerodrome outright, but by 1962 orders for the planes made there had begun to drop and redundancies were inevitable.).  &lt;br/&gt;In 1968 the RAF allowed planes (Gnats) used by the Red Arrows display team to be serviced over the winter at Bitteswell, this continued until 1972. A new public house in Lutterworth was subsequently named in their honour. &lt;br/&gt;By March 1983 the aerodrome had completely closed. The following year the land had been bought by Douglas Arnold who intended to use the aerodrome primarily for vintage aircraft. However it was resold in1986 and the MFI bought the land to develop the distribution centre, Magna park..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is at what would have been the north east end of the main runway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF honours go to &quot;Rich Uder Smith&quot;, good on yer.&lt;br/&gt;STF Goes to redvark

Once we got to GZ a search of the probable place soon turned up the cache.

&lt;p&gt;Tottle brook is shown on the above map of Wollaton from 1901.
(the &quot;Model Cottage&quot; is directly opposite the cache site). It runs
from up near 
Shaws Plantation, flows through Wollaton, and the 
University Park filling up the 
paddling pool, through Dunkirk and finally into the River
Trent. The brook is easily visible on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org&quot;&gt;Open Street Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking as available in the nearby Bramcote lane shops car park,
on street nearby or in the pub car park just over the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual cache is a nano/micro located near ground level and
is wearing a disguise. &lt;b&gt;Please take extra care making you you
don't drop the cache into the water below!&lt;/b&gt; Bring some Tweezers
(or similar) to get the log out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wollaton Hall is a spectacular Elizabethan mansion in the heart
of Nottingham. It is a prominent Grade One Listed building and
following its major programme of restoration, visitors of all ages
are welcome to visit the hall and park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing on a natural hill three miles west of Nottingham City
Centre, Wollaton Hall is set in five hundred acres of spectacular
gardens and parkland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On site, in addition to the historic hall and its sumptuous
grounds, visitors will find Nottingham's Natural History Museum,
Nottingham's Industrial Museum (Open the last Sunday of each month
for Sunday Steamings) and the Yard Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park opens at 8am on weekdays and 9am at Weekends and Bank

After finding the playing fields cache, my planned route to the Lime Tree Avenue cache took me to the east of the plantation. However, my lack of local knowledge was exposed when I rounded the corner and found my way blocked by the golf course. I therefore amended my route to find this one next.

After dawdling to let a muggle past, the cache was quickly found.

Thanks for the cache,

Found only 100ft from where I had parked my campervan, this was the final cache in this park today and was a quick find. Stealth was needed, but wasn't too difficult to employ.

It's been a thoroughly enjoyable walk in a lovely location, very many thanks for this cache and for the whole series.

We performed what must have looked from afar like a family tree-circling dance, but then a tell-tale was noticed and the cache soon retrieved.

Halfway round my circuit of Wollaton Hall I diverted to a couple of the Canal caches and to this one. It proved to be the sort of location you might visit a dozen times and be thwarted by muggles every time, but I struck lucky and had the place to myself - that really was fortunate, as it was a tidy step from the park, and I'm unlikely to get here again.

A neat hide, but I quickly spotted it was out of place. Thanks for the cache,

A Deer park in Nottingham, dogs are welcome as are pushchairs etc. Parking is available in the main Wollaton Hall car parks and on Harrow Road, both car parks are within 10 mins walk of the cache. The container is orange, about three inches tall and fairly easy to spot. Should take less than an hour to complete.

Wollaton hall is a grand, grade 1 listed, Elizabethan House designed by Robert Smythson and built in 1588 by Sir Francis Willoughby. It is owned by Nottingham city council and contains Nottingham’s natural history musem. There is a Gorilla and a Giraffe to look for. It’s 500 acres of Deer park, lake and gardens are yours to enjoy for a parking fee of £2 a day. The Deer roam free so dogs must be leashed. There is also an industrial museum and a Basford beam engine that can be seen in steam on the last Sunday of the month, well worth timing your visit for. Smaller than the engine at Papplewick, but great, none the less. The staff are friendly, informative and a bit of a hoot.
There are toilets and good coffee available in the courtyard.

The second day of my East Midlands caching trip, and I left the caravan site at Cotgrave fully expecting to hit the morning rush hour on my 12 mile drive here. But my campervan sailed through with no traffic at all - even the threat of long queues due to roadworks failed to materialise, and I pulled into the car park just 15 minutes after leaving the site. Do you not have a rush hour here :-) ?

There were some muggles by the car park cache, so I decided to leave that until the end, and headed here first. With such an open expanse through 180 degrees this could be a tricky one to do stealthily, but at this time of the morning I had the entire place to myself and it was no trouble at all.

Thanks for the cache,

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A nano placed near to the band stand in Nottingham's
Arboretum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Nottingham Inclosure Act of 1845 - a visionary
project to create a green network around the growing city, to
provide green spaces for relaxation, contemplation, learning,
exercise and clean air - the Arboretum was the first public park
opened in Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The layout and design was carried out under the supervision of
Samuel Curtis, a botanist and horticultural publicist in 1850 who
had previously been involved with the layout of Victoria Park in
the East End of London in 1842.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main aim of the design for Arboretum Park was to take
advantage of the landscape setting whilst providing an interlinking
network of walkways and socialising areas. As a result over 1010
specimen trees and shrubs were planted along with winding paths and
sweeping lawns. The plantings were laid out in what is known as
'The Natural Order' to provide an educational link to nature
through botanical interpretation. Today, some of the mature trees
and shrubs growing here are living relics of the original
collection such as the Lime Trees which were planted as nursery
trees. There are currently over 800 trees of 65 species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout of the park is relatively unchanged and as a result
the Arboretum is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks
&amp; Gardens maintained by English Heritage and contains 9 Grade
II Listed structures within its layout, providing a key asset to
Nottingham's Victorian Heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key features within the park include the Waverly Street Lodge
and entrance, the lake, the Chinese Bell Tower, the Victorian
Circular Aviary, the newly renovated Victorian Flower Garden,
Dahlia &amp; Formal garden, the North Sherwood Street entrance, the
statue of Feargus O'Connor, the bust of Samuel Morley and the
Bandstand, an important local feature, which was moved from the
castle site in 1881.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arboretum continues to boast one of the premier tree
collections within the County and is one of the few large green
spaces within the city centre. There has been over £1 million
investment since 2002, following a successful Heritage lottery bid.
The Arboretum has been awarded the Green Flag in 2006, 2007 and
2008 and hopes to retain this award in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park opens at 8am on weekdays and 9am at weekends and Bank
holidays, and closes just before it gets dark (for a full listing
of times click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3305&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure you wedge the cache container firmly back in
place.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the Tissington Trail can be found
here:http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/hptt/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

cache in the series contains a number and letter which relates to the final mystery cache.

This particular cache has been placed on Stanton Moor on the edge of the Peak District near to the 9 ladies stone circle English Heritage site. The moor has been used for over 4000 years for agriculture, mining, living settlements and as a burial ground. Legend has it that the stone circle was created when 9 ladies and a fiddler were all turned to stone for dancing on the sabbath.

The cache can be done as part of small circular walk, parking at
Birchover quarry car park.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Copied from my OpenCachingUK log:

On my final morning, the best cache of my mini break. Spectacular countryside of the type I like the best, high on the moors. The sun shone from a blue sky, even though this late in the year it wasn't strong enough to burn off the heavy mist that was lying in the valleys. And I had this lovely landscape all to myself.

The cache was tricky to find, even with the hint, and I was pleased finally to place my hand on it.

This cache gets a recommendation point, of course. But it gets more than that. I create unique TOP CACHE geo-coins for presentation to the owners of the best caches I find, and this cache qualifies. It will be 3 months before it is ready, but examples can be seen on http://www.amberel.com/topcache.htm.

Thanks for an excellent cache, and a most enjoyable morning,

Rgds, Andy

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache, located at the top of high Street where it suddenly and surprisingly comes to an end and turns into a rough cart track by the accurately named Top House.

The village of Pilsley is in a sheltered position, east of Chatsworth.  The village consists of limestone cottages, enriched by gardens full of colour, many of the occupiers having learned the craft in the gardens at Chatsworth House. 

The cache, located at the top of High Street where it suddenly and surprisingly comes to an end and turns into a rough cart track by the accurately named Top House. The 35mm cartridge is located just within the wooded area off the track.  ** For Parking, please park on High Street, or further down in the village before where the road turns into the cart track **

The name of the cache links in to the historical past of the village and in particular the point at where at the top of High Street it splits in to three pathways; the one going straight on is of the most historical significance, as this was the route used by packhorses carrying lead from Monyash bound for the North Sea. Pilsley was a stopping point, where fresh animals were substituted for the next section of the journey.    
 
Almost all Pilsley’s population either works on, or used to work on the Chatsworth Estate - or holds a connection with the estate through a partner. The inhabitants have a wide range of skills as they have had the task of maintaining Chatsworth House and Gardens over the last 400 years.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a pull in to park the car and access is via a well trodden path through the broken stone wall about 10 meters east of the lay by. Please note although this is a single track lane it does get busy and cars do speed so please keep pets and children at hand until through the wall. 


This cache is a little different. It is only big enough for the log book and a small pencil, although I would advise taking your own pen/pencil. It’s well hidden and GPS in this area can be a little unreliable (you’ll see why on arrival). Please be careful when retrieving the log book and replacing it.

This cache is a small plastic box containing a log book and pen along with a few other items. We placed the cache at Linacre because it is a place I have visited many times thought-out my life and the location holds many memories. I still visit often to jog the 3 miles around the reservoirs. Around the lakes regular information boards inform you about the history of the area. It’s a great place to visit for all the family.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

Nipped into Clumber Park and parked the Cachemobile in a small turning before venturing out into the darkness to look for this cache. Thankfully there was a small amount of moonlight and with the light from my GPSr screen I managed to search ground zero and locate the cache! Neat hiding place and pleased to say it was found without any bushwhacking required, as I'm my best shirt and suit for a wedding reception. There was a sheet of paper/litter blowing around at ground zero, I'm fairly sure it wasn't from the cache as it seemed to talk about some kind of walking challenge, with participants names and details on it. I hooked it onto a nearby branch to stop it blowing away, maybe if it's still there and hasn't been collected by however lost it, the next cacher could CITO it out?

Thanks for the cache and now I must try and slip back into the party down the road [;)]

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

It's a family friendly length of a walk and a lovely little climbing and walking adventure for the children but you cannot take a pushchair! Too rocky...

C &amp; O, two little girls from Germany who have lived, met and become friends in Sheffield climbed this little mountain, clambered on some rocks and hid a cache to remember their fabulous time and say goodbye - for a while.</groundspeak:long_description>

Here you rode your bikes, climbed on walls, splashed in the water, hid in a growing shed, and balanced along.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

&quot;Ooh... those rocks look like a great place for a cache,&quot; says Booshka as we're driving along the road. So in search of the rocks, and a hidey hole we go.

Yes, it is a lovely place for a cache, the views are great from here, but Booshka does apologise as the getting there bit is hard in the wind.

From the car parking co-ordinates go over the stile, turn left walk a few paces and look for a path to the right.

A nice steady walk lead me up to the ridge and rocky outcrop.  The cache was found in the first place I looked which I love when that happens as there could have been quite a few other sneaky hides around here.  Well done for the &quot;Cache Du Jour&quot; rating as this is a brilliant cache and location with amazing views all round!!!  TFTC Left Yorkshire Day Coin and took Sheep coin - onwards to that 1400 now!  </groundspeak:text>

Our oldest remaining cache and nearly 8 years old.  This is the second one we placed all those years ago... hopefully it will make it to 10 years old!

Cache on a hill which overlooks Glossop. Steep path up the hill, though levels out at the top.  The cache location can offer shelter from the wind, which is sometimes a bit strong up here.  After finding the cache, head back, but take a left down the patch for some different scenery on the way back to your car.

From car park walk up hill and over the summit to the footpath near to just past the pull-in space at N53 25.623  W01 58.118, up the steep path to find the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  

The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     

Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  
3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  
4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.
5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.
6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit

Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.

Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.

Terrain is flat with easy parking, no walking needed. 


Strikes lean sinewed at the tooth end of a day,
Quid Spent hewing after the brown-spit
Mines Dead:
This resurrection, tin and copper born,
Earth’s legacy, remembering,
Stood black coated in the drizzle,
Silver band, usual marquee,
Coal’s generation lost,
Save for these unfurled banners and this song,
Our bitter memory.
Right the perhaps, that he should kneel,
Poised on his epitaph, this man of bronze,
Beneath the church reclaiming this waste land,
Closed in his seam of time defiantly,
When we are gone, a watching sentinel,
Who taps the load of all this heritage,
Collected days of sacrifice,
Dark shifts undone:
And right that we should gatherhere to honour him,
Made more of us for our remembrance,
Made air and daylight, the eternal sun, 
By Paul Thwaites

This is a Nano Cache in a fairly urban area, however most of the time you should not draw any unwanted attention due to the location of the cache.

The cache is located just off the canal towpath near to the bridge. You are looking for a smallish clip top box. I have placed the cache in a spot which does not suffer from too much tree coverage so please hide well and place back the stones covering.

&lt;p&gt;We happened to spot this sign while driving along the main road
close to home, and obviously, were intrigued!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we went to investigate, we met &quot;Nature Dave&quot; and all became
clear....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This path was used as access to Crofton pit, now a nature
reserve. Local residents have been using it for years and have now
made a proper, way-marked path. It's a sight to behold!&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is my first! It's a very small micro-cache - a 1ml phial concealed with permission in a crack in the wall. It contains only a rolled up log - you'll need your own writing paraphernalia. You may need tweezers to extract the cache and the log.
Be sure to take some loose change and feed the ducks!</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is cleverly hidden close to the Mackershaw Lodge Gates as you enter the area. 

Please be aware that Mackershaw is part of the Deer Park and as such is home to herds of cattle and deer (bulls are kept in the next door field). Stags rut from Mid-September through to October and visitors are advised to be extra cautious during this time. 

Fawning season is between June and August, during which time visitors are asked to be especially mindful of the deer.  

Dogs on short leads are welcome throughout the Estate. 

In addition to this the privately-owned shoot situated on the Fountains Estate has the right to shoot on the Estate on Fridays between November-February. Mackershaw remains open for visitors during this time, however visitors should be aware of this and remain cautious of the shoot.    </groundspeak:long_description>

Terrain is relatively steep and littered with rocks, but a pleasant walk allowing for great views of the Deer Park and surrounding areas. 

Please be aware that Mackershaw is part of the Deer Park and as such is home to herds of cattle and deer (bulls are kept in the next door field). Stags rut from Mid-September- October and visitors should be extra cautious during this period. 

Fawning season is between June and August, during which time visitors are asked to be especially mindful of the deer.  

Dogs on short leads are welcome throughout the Estate. 

In addition to this the privately-owned shoot situated on the Fountains Estate has the right to shoot on the Estate on Fridays between November-February. Mackershaw remains open for visitors during this time, however visitors should be aware of this and remain cautious of the shoot.   </groundspeak:long_description>

Could the owner of the cache please contact me.
It would seem that Opencache units have been placed very close to Geocaches that have been given permission by the NT.
Would just like some verification with the cache owner ;*)
Contact me at Madyokel@Bolam.Org

Cheers

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This National Trust multicache will take you on a short hike
around Scarth Wood Moor - a beautiful part of the North York Moors
National Park and a great spot for wildlife too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views from the top of the moor are fantastic. In spring
displaying snipe are a common sight and cuckoos can often be seen
too. In summer the moors turn purple as the heather flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates given are not for the cache itself, but for the
suggested parking. The area can get busy in the summer and if the
car park is full it is recommended to wait for a space. The road is
a clearway and parking on the roadside is illegal. The police
regularly visit to issue tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the cache you will have to answer the following
questions. For each of them you will need to convert letter into
numbers. (ie a=1, b=2, c=3, etc):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qustion One - N 54° 23.204 W 001° 16.893&lt;br/&gt;
There are twelve letters carved into the stone. Add together the
2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54° 23.494 W 001° 17.379&lt;br/&gt;
There is a single letter carved into a stone here. What number
represents this letter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54° 23.542 W 001° 17.495&lt;br/&gt;
Time to admire the view and have a bit of a rest after the climb to
the top of the hill. The bench here commemorates Eleanor Mary
Lawson. What are the last two digits of the year of her birth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the cache is N 54° 23.??? W 001° 17.0??&lt;br/&gt;
The last three digits of the northing are your answer to question
two + (10 x your answer to question one).&lt;br/&gt;
The last two digits of the easting are given by your answer to
question three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is extremely popular with visitors so stealth will be
required at all times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There is car parking right next to the first question and the rest of the walk is off road and should take less than an hour. The cache is also listed on geocaching.com where it has been completed many times without any problems.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A short hike???  To the 1st clue maybe, our GPS took us on a 40 minute walk, along quite a busy stretch of road for the 1st (with no pavement) 20 minutes or so, to the 2nd clue, which we couldn't find.  While the kids were still looking I loaded the next co'ordinates into the GPS and found a 10 mile walk....  We decided then to give up, there was a public footpath signposted, though this wasn't signposted at the beginning of or 40 minute walk, which turned from a walk through a field to an almost dangerous clamber down a rocky hillside.  We have found caches before with this level of difficulty and terrain, always with the family, including a 3yr old, and never had any problems.  We were disappointed that this one went so wrong.  We won't be doing another multi in a hurry.</groundspeak:text>

mission around Cliff Ridge Wood and Cliff Rigg Quarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace and tranquillity that can be enjoyed in Cliff Ridge
Wood and Quarry is a stark contrast to how the area would have been
towards the end of the 19th century. At this time the quarry was in
full swing with large quantities of whinstone being removed and
transported away by tram, the remains of which can still be seen in
the wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whinstone itself was formed around 58 million years ago when
volcanic activity caused hot molten rock to be injected through the
sedimentary bedrock. Over the millennia this weathered more slowly
than the surrounding rock causing ridges to be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find out more about both the formation of the ridge and
the history of the quarry reading the information panels that
provide the fact you will need to complete this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

mission around Roseberry Topping – Cleveland’s most
famous natural landmark.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This distinctive shaped hill has a long history of providing
inspiration to those who visit it. When the Vikings invaded and
came to the area they believed that the hill was sacred and
dedicated it to their god Odin. The modern name of Roseberry is in
fact a corruption of the Norse name Odin’s Berg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a boy, the famous explorer Captain James Cook lived with his
family at Airey Holme Farm, which can be seen to the south of the
summit. When he had time off from working as a farm hand, the young
James is said to have got his first taste of exploration and
adventure by climbing to the top of Roseberry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other fascinating facts and stories associated
with Roseberry Topping many of which you’ll discover in
completing this multicache. The final cache contains ‘The
Terrible Tale of Prince Oswy’ – the hill’s most
horrifying legend. Be sure to read it before you sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite what is says on the plate there is considerable
disagreement about when and by whom this folly was built.
It’s also more likely that it was intended to be a summer
house where Victorian visitors could rest before continuing the
climb to the summit, than a shooting box. At least we can be
certain of the year in which it was restored. When was this?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = 19AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54°30.325' W 001°06.438'&lt;br/&gt;
Triangulations pillars were erected by the Ordnance Survey from
1935 on prominent hills across Great Britain. On a clear day it was
possible to see at least two other triangulation pillars at every
point. By carefully measuring the angles between each pillar the
Ordnance Survey were able to accurately map the whole of the
country. Every triangulation pillar has a unique reference number.
What is the number of this pillar?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = S4CDE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54°30.349' W 001°06.281'&lt;br/&gt;
The Cleveland Way is a long distance footpath that runs from
Helmsley to Filey and visits Roseberry Topping. How far would you
have to walk from here to reach Filey?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = FG&lt;/p&gt;

So, if you had the answers A=1, D=7, E=3, G=9, I=8 and J= 6 the latitude would be;

N 54 32.(9-6)(7-1)(8-3) = N 54 32.385

We tried minusing some, G - J, D -A etc but that didn't work, can the hider help us out with this please???</groundspeak:text>

Ormesby Hall, home of acts of kindness, was lived in by the influential and community spirited Pennyman family, for nearly 400 years. Ormesby Hall consists of two houses, the Old Wing built in the early 1600s and the Georgian mansion built in the 1740s. The Hall is surrounded by a lovely landscaped estate, some of which is farmland. Also on the estate is the 18thC Stables, now the home of the Cleveland Police Mounted Section, and Grange Farm which was the home farm for the Hall and is now a private tenanted farm. 
Since the last owner owner of Ormesby Hall, Lt.Col. James Pennyman died in 1961, Ormesby Hall has been in the hands of the National Trust, a major charity who look after historic buildings and areas of countryside ‘For Ever, For Everyone’. The Trust is not only responsible for the conservation of heritage and environment but also for making visitors welcome. We hope you enjoy your time here.

Ormesby Hall #3		BEHIND THE SCENES
Park off the estate on Church Lane unless the Hall is open to the public. You run the risk of being locked in at closing time if you use the estate car park. 
The gardens at the back of Ormesby Hall were the setting for many theatrical and musical performances produced by Mrs Ruth Pennyman. The most notable were Shakespeare’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’, ‘Romeo and Juliet’ and ‘Henry V’ put on to raise funds to build the Village Hall in 1937. It is still standing in Hall Close.

Ormesby Hall #5		ST CUTHBERT WAS HERE?
Park off the estate on Church Lane unless the Hall is open to the public. You run the risk of being locked in at closing time if you use the estate car park. 
According to legend, a resting place for St Cuthbert’s coffin on its way from Lindisfarne to Durham, the church of St Cuthbert dates back to medieval times. In the south walls of the church can be seen ancient grave covers used in reconstruction. The carvings represent a high status gentleman (sword), a high status lady (scissors) and a priest (chalice). In the corner of the churchyard nearest to the Hall you will find graves of the Pennyman family.

Ormesby Hall #2		HOME FOR HORSES 
Park off the estate on Church Lane unless the Hall is open to the public. You run the risk of being locked in at closing time if you use the estate car park. 
The Stable Block was built in 1779 by the infamous ‘Wicked’ Sir James Pennyman who used the Hall as his summer residence, entertaining his London friends, going to local race courses and betting on the horses. He managed to bankrupt himself through gambling and high living. These magnificent Stables now house horses of the Cleveland Police Mounted Section who regularly patrol at Middlesbrough Football Club matches.

The Main Gate is the grand entrance designed in the 18thC to give visitors an impressive start to their journey up the drive towards the Hall, which is deliberately hidden from view to keep up the suspense. Two large stone lions used to sit on the top of the gateposts and can still be seen if you visit the Hall as they had to be taken inside to conserve them.

A small cache in the area of the old football ground. There is limited street-side parking in the area, you won't be able to see or grab this from your car, but it should be an easy, disabled friendly cache and grab for anyone who happens to be in the area. Plenty of people walk and drive along here all the time, so please be a little careful when caching!

Cache contains log book &amp; pencil. Please put it back carefully and out of sight.

Middlesbrough played their last season here in 1995 before moving to the Riverside Stadium which also has it's own cache - Riverside Roar (GC1CAQB). The street names and the layout of the roads give good clues as to where everything used to be (the street &quot;The Turnstiles&quot; leads to &quot;The Midfield&quot;). There's nothing to see here now, it's just housing. For those that like their football memories if you do the nearby Dorman Museum cache (GC14KJQ) then to your left you can see a statue of Brian Clough walking to Ayresome Park in the local park, well worth a closer look. </groundspeak:long_description>

This National Trust Trail will take you on a fact finding mission around our field at Horden. It's just one of the caches we have placed along the part of the Durham Coast that we care for, so if you enjoy this one please check out the others.

The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.

The Durham Coast has recovered from its industrial past to become one of the finest stretches of coastline in the country. The Magnesian Limestone that underlies the area gives rise to spectacular displays of rare wild-flowers in the summer while the steep sided denes that cut through the cliff are sheltered havens for all sorts of wildlife.


Cotsford field at Horden is a spectacular wild-flower meadow in summer. It may look natural, but we've given it a helping hand become so species rich by adding a wild-flower seed mix. It's cut once a year to stop scrub species invading.

Make sure you make a note of the numbers written both on the lid and the logbook of each of the four caches as you will need them to find the bonus cache.

Raintonpark Wood has fantastic wildlife and is a really peaceful place to spend a few hours, especially by the river Wear. It has some interesting historical features too. Look out for the cobbled stream. It was built by monks to transport coal mined in nearby Mallygill Wood.

The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone. Please help us keep Raintonpark Wood special by sticking to the circular path that will take you close to all the caches and by avoiding trampling vegetation.

The whole of Mallygill Wood is designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument for its coal mining remains. During the 14th century coal had become a valuable commodity and at Mallygill Wood the coal naturally occurred near the surface. Monks from Finchale Abbey are believed to have mined the coal here. They dug down into the seam and then along to collect more coal, creating bell shaped pits. You can still see where these bell pit were today. Just look out for the hollows that can be found throughout the woods.

Mallygill wood is also a fantastic place for wildlife with plenty of woodland flowers on display in early spring.

The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.

Please help us keep Mallygill Wood special by sticking to the footpath until you are close to the cache and not trampling the vegetation.

Trust along the part of the Durham Coast that we care for, so if

&lt;p&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Durham Coast has recovered from its industrial past to
become one of the finest stretches of coastline in the country. The
Magnesian Limestone that underlies the area gives rise to
spectacular displays of rare wild-flowers in the summer while the
steep sided denes that cut through the cliff are sheltered havens
for all sorts of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawthorn Towers was a Gothic-style 30 room mansion built around
1810 by Major George Anderson of Newcastle. It was bought by the
Pemberton family in the 1850s. In the 1930s it was rented by the
Boys' Brigade for weekend camps then during WW2 it was used by the
military and the Home Guard. The Pemberton family sold it in the
late 1940s and it had several owners before being demolished in
1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it is hard to believe there was ever a big mansion house
here. There are a few clues however, including the fruit trees and
bushes that grown in a patch of trees that used to be the orchard.
You can find this cache among them.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The park dates back to the 1930's and is one of the main attractions in the town and is a 'gateway site' to the Great North Forest. The River Wear runs along the East of the park and it's next to the Durham County Cricket ground. This used to be the main entrance to the park before the pedestrian footbridge was built. This is a nano so bring a pen, also if the log hasn't been replaced properly it can be tricky to extract so come prepared! You can access the cache either from the park or as a drive by from the A167 dual carriageway where there is a small space for one car to pull in. There is a pay and display car park in the park itself.</groundspeak:long_description>

Penshaw Hill in order to reveal the final location of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Penshaw Monument was built in 1844 in honour of John George
Lambton, first Earl of Durham and the first Governor of the
Province of Canada. The design is based on the Temple of
Hephaestus, a Greek temple in Athens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penshaw Hill is also the setting for part of the story of the
Lambton Worm. This mythical dragon is said to have terrorised the
area and grew so large that it could wrap its tail ten times around
the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the National Trust care for the monument and the hill
itself making it a great place for both visitors and wildlife. The
National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car parking is available below Penshaw Hill at N 54°52.926' W
001°28.716'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question One: N 54°52.896' W 001°28.736'&lt;br/&gt;
The interpretation panel shows the various visitor attractions in
the area. How many National Trust sites are marked?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54°52.912' W 001°28.736'&lt;br/&gt;
Take some the time to read all about the wildlife and history of
Penshaw Hill. Find out what year the west side of the monument was
rebuilt.&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = 19&lt;b&gt;BC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54°52.981' W 001°28.858'&lt;br/&gt;
The placard on the monument was put in place when it was donated to
the National Trust in 1939. It includes further information on John
George Lambton, including the date of his death. When was
this?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;DE&lt;/b&gt; July 1840&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Four: N 54°52.981' W 001°28.877'&lt;br/&gt;
Triangulations pillars were erected by the Ordnance Survey from
1935 on prominent hills across Great Britain. On a clear day it was
possible to see at least two other triangulation pillars at every
point. By carefully measuring the angles between each pillar the
Ordnance Survey were able to accurately map the whole of the
country. Every triangulation pillar has a unique reference number.
What is the number of this pillar?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = S&lt;b&gt;FGHI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal: N 54
5(&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;+&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;).(&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;)
W 001
2(&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;).(&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is extremely popular with visitors so stealth will be
required at all times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Penshaw Monument is a Doric tetrastyle monument and is a half size replica of The Temple of Hephaestus in Athens. Construction was started on the site in 1844 and in 1939 the 5th Earl of Durham donated the monument and the surrounding hill to the National Trust. Penshaw Monument is one of the best known landmarks in the North East of England being easily visible from both the A1(M) motorway and A19 on approching the area from the south. A climb up the hill offers commanding views of the area. The cache is not located within the monument itself, but very near by. The terrain has been given a mark of 3 as, while not particularly difficult, the final climb up to the top of the hill is quite steep but should be manageable by any able bodied person. Thank you to the National Trust who kindly gave their permission to site the cache here.</groundspeak:long_description>

squishy under foot.

The cache is a plastic box with a blue lid, has a stress ball (yer
might need it! :o) ), an old MOD service lock knife, a Moss Trooper
minimap, (only one of it's kind!) and some other stuff!
&lt;p&gt;Not giving too much away as it is so easy to get to, so made it
difficult to find. Just look around and think, were would I hide it
in this place.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not normally one for arty-farty things.  But this is actually quite an impressive structure.  I've seen a few public art things, and this is by far the best.  In Warrington they have 'Close Encounter' which they claim is taller than this.  It's certainly not as impressive as this.  Its one of those things to visit when you're passing.

The girls loved it.

From certain angles today, it really did look like the sun shone out of the angel's bottom.

Despite the rather slippery approach, the cache was found really easily.  No sign of any travel bugs.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the first of our new series of geocaches hidden around the beautiful National Trust Gibside estate near Rowlands Gill, Burnopfield, Gateshead, NE16 6BG. All of the caches are hidden very close to the paths around the park, but you may need to look carefully to spot them.

Discover fine Derwent Valley views, winding paths and elegant  Georgian buildings and ruins as you hunt for the caches. Gibside is also a haven for wildlife with red kites often circling in the skies above.

This cache is a 2.6L clip &amp; close plastic container – cleverly camouflaged, we hope! We’ve started off the stash with lots of fun goodies to be swapped – please write your swap down in the logbook.

This cache also contains a fun family activity idea for you to try while you are there – we hope you enjoy it.

Please be aware that the caches are accessible during the regular published opening hours only (normally 10am – 6pm but please visit www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gibside to check up to date details). Access to the estate is free to all National Trust members, an admission fee is payable for non-members. 

Some of the paths around Gibside have steep slopes and may be slippery in wet weather. Please take care as you explore.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first attempt at an OpenCaching cache (I have coming up to 200 finds on the other site) unfortunately this was unsuccessful. 

Got to GZ and there was lots of potential hiding places but no sign of a cache. I didn't want to rip the place apart too much, this is National Trust property after all. 

There being no hint didn't help - it's very unusual for a cache not to have a hint 

If someone could confirm that the cache is still in situ and perhaps if the owner supplied a hint (for this and the other Gibside caches) then I shall return!

pS Enjoyed our day at Gibside anyway especially the history tour we were given by the guide.</groundspeak:text>

This was our 3rd find at Gibside.  Disappointing box, we thought people might not have taken it seriously, swaps weren't great - a carrier bag?????  We took a leaflet for Beamish Wild and replaced it with a dice rubber.
Didn't do the activity as another family appeared that we thought might also be geocachers :/</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the third of our new series of geocaches hidden around the beautiful National Trust Gibside estate near Rowlands Gill, Burnopfield, Gateshead, NE16 6BG. All of the caches are hidden very close to the paths around the park, but you may need to look carefully to spot them.

Discover fine Derwent Valley views, winding paths and elegant  Georgian buildings and ruins as you hunt for the caches. Gibside is also a haven for wildlife with red kites often circling in the skies above.

This cache is a 2.6L clip &amp; close plastic container – cleverly camouflaged, we hope! We’ve started off the stash with lots of fun goodies to be swapped – please write your swap down in the logbook.

This cache also contains a fun family activity idea for you to try while you are there – we hope you enjoy it.

Please be aware that the caches are accessible during the regular published opening hours only (normally 10am – 6pm but please visit www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gibside to check up to date details). Access to the estate is free to all National Trust members, an admission fee is payable for non-members. 

Some of the paths around Gibside have steep slopes and may be slippery in wet weather. Please take care as you explore.

Our 1st official find as geocaches, well done Brand.
Great box, lots of things to swap, we took a bug finding kit and replaced it with a funky pen.
Tree activity was interesting, kids all got involved, same with searching for paw prints.</groundspeak:text>

The cache is on the south bank of the River Tyne.  There are a couple of bits of 'Art' along this section of the river.  This one is one of the more interesting.  A herd of goats made up of all sorts of bits of scrap metal.  There are 7 goats altogether.

The terrain is set at a two because there is a short steep climb to get to the goats, but if yer a bit of a goat it should not prove a problem

The cache is a magnetic nano just containing a log so bring your own pencil.  :o)</groundspeak:long_description>

Used for centuries by local fisherman the Wherry is now part of the coastal park maintained by the National Trust situated at Souter Lighthouse. The bay itself has some impressive views of the local coast as you descend down to it and is a nice quiet spot to explore. </groundspeak:long_description>

South Gosforth is a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne in England. It is the location of a depot for the Tyne and Wear Metro service, which is surrounded by a small industrial estate that mainly houses production facilities for the Greggs food chain. Many Metro services start or terminate at South Gosforth Metro Station due to its proximity to the depot.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is one of my pot caches&lt;br/&gt;
Now whilst doing some rooting around for this cache I am now more
confused than when I started. Rothley castle stands above Rothley
crags, south west of Rothley Hall.&lt;br/&gt;
North of the castle is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donaldmcdonald.free-online.co.uk/rothley08.htm&quot;&gt;Codger
Fort&lt;/a&gt; which is known to be a folly. The info I have says that
the ruined castle to the south (this cache) is the real Rothley
Castle and was once a 14th cent Pele Tower. The stone work I have
seen bares no resemblance to a ruined Pele tower at all, and even
on an OS map it isn't shown as such.&lt;br/&gt;
Anyways I digress The area is open access and can be approached
from just about any direction, although if you leave by heading
straight down hill, the first step of the stone style over the wall
is very high. Made friends with a Kestrel on way up so if yer see
it say Hi from me :)&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy the walk, the views are good on a clear day and the bracken
is dying back.&lt;br/&gt;
If you walk to the edge of the crag be careful, its a canny drop,
but look for the carved names etc. especially J.H. Rothley 1850,
very professional job fer a pen knife !!!
