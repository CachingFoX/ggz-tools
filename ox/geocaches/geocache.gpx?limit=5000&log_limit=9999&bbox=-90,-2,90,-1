            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Diego de Siloé&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diego de Siloé —también citado por los historiadores como Diego de Siloe— (Burgos, c. 1495 - 1563), arquitecto y escultor español, uno de los primeros artistas del Renacimiento en este país.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Con toda probabilidad fue hijo del escultor gótico Gil de Siloé, y pasó la primera parte de su carrera artística (1519-1528) en su lugar de nacimiento, Burgos, donde trabajó principalmente como escultor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La obra artística de Siloé combinó el estilo renacentista italiano (que había estudiado en una visita a Nápoles hacia 1517), con las influencias del estilo gótico español y del arte árabe. La Escalera Dorada de la catedral de Burgos es su obra más importante de este periodo (1519). Su proporcionada, rotunda y airosa estructura con esculturas de querubines, escudos de armas y ornamentación vegetal, ocupa en su totalidad uno de los muros de la catedral. Con esta obra, Siloé salvó el desnivel de la puerta de la Coronería de la catedral, situada en el brazo norte del crucero de la misma, e incorporó además elementos arquitectónicos de raigambre clasicista, al modo del arquitecto italiano Donato Bramante, diseñando una escalera monumental que se bifurca en dos tramos paralelos al muro del fondo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desde 1528 hasta el final de su vida trabajó en Granada, sobre todo como arquitecto. Su llegada a la ciudad supone el asentamiento de las propuestas de carácter clasicista en Andalucía. Se le encargó terminar dos conjuntos arquitectónicos proyectados anteriormente con una finalidad funeraria: la iglesia del Monasterio de San Jerónimo (lugar de enterramiento de los Fernández de Córdoba, incluyendo la tumba del Gran Capitán) y la catedral de Granada, donde realizó uno de los edificios más destacados del estilo renacentista español. De este templo destaca la organización de su cabecera, como un enorme espacio central cubierto con una gran cúpula, al modo de los edificios funerarios de la época romana. En el sistema de alzados, se pueden observar referencias al arte de Filippo Brunelleschi con unos grandes pilares sobre cuyos frentes se apoyan medias columnas corintias, duplicando además la altura de las naves con un segundo cuerpo de soportes sobre el entablamento del primero. Sobresale también la portada del Perdón (hacia 1534) concebida a modo de un gran arco de triunfo. Su rica decoración y las líneas y curvas, enérgicas y fluidas, de su interior fueron una temprana expresión del estilo plateresco en el arte español.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otros de sus proyectos más destacados son la Iglesia de la Encarnación de Íllora (espléndida muestra de la arquitectura de transición del gótico al renacimiento construida entre 1542 y 1573, en la que también participó uno de sus discípulos, Juan de Maeda) y la Sacra Capilla del Salvador de Úbeda, concebida como lugar de enterramiento de la familia Cobos. Tiene una nave central de tres tramos, capillas laterales entre contrafuertes y una cabecera circular cubierta con una gran cúpula. Por último, habría que señalar la proyección de su arquitectura en España (catedrales de Almería, Málaga y Guadix) y en la América española, en las catedrales de Guadalajara (Jalisco), Lima y Cuzco (Perú).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pero la obra de este artista sin par no sólo se subscribe al sur peninsular y al entorno burgalés, pues, de su imaginario surgió uno de los conjuntos funerarios más fascinantes con los que cuenta la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca, el Mausoleo del que fuera Presidente de la Chancillería de Granada, el Obispo Rodrigo Mercado de Zuazola. Esculpido en mármol blanco, lleno de grutescos y de escenas alegóricas y que se puede admirar en la Capilla de la Piedad de la Iglesia de San Miguel Arcángel (Oñate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Información sacada de &quot;Wikipedia&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

Pues bien, deberás ir a esta calle y encontrar la primera pista.(Foto Spoiler http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/229/atlantida1.jpg)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2- Una vez encontrada la primera pista, debes descifrarla para hallar la ubicación exacta del caché. Después desde donde te encuentras, atravesar el parque hasta la calle paralela y girar a la derecha,camina todo recto, encontrarás el símbolo antes de llegar a los 500 metros, entre unas columnas que podrían ser de la mismísima Atlántida.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Pasaje de Lodares&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galería comercial y residencial existente en la ciudad de Albacete. Situado entre las calles Tinte y Mayor, esta edificación es ejemplo de arquitectura modernista de principios del siglo XX. Fue proyectado por el arquitecto valenciano D. Buenaventura Ferrando Castells en 1925,1 siguiendo una tendencia que llegó a España durante el reinado de Isabel II, evolucionó durante la Restauración borbónica y alcanzó su máxima expresión en el s. XIX por influencia del resto de Europa. Gabriel Lodares, lo mandó construir a imagen y semejanza de las galerias comerciales existentes en Italia, con pisos destinados a un público con alto poder económico, así como los locales comerciales, por lo que se planteó como un pasaje particular y cerrado, si bien es de libre paso desde el amanecer hasta el anochecer para permitir el acceso a los comercios en él situados.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Está cubierto por un gran tragaluz de cristales con arcos de hierro que une dos céntricas calles, la del Tinte y la calle Mayor. La fachada de la calle del Tinte comprende una superficie más amplia y monumental, mientras la fachada de la calle Mayor es más modesta debido a que el propietario de la casa situada a su izquierda no accedió finalmente a un su venta. Debido a esto, dicha fachada es asimétrica y algunos de los locales comerciales son claramente más estrechos que el resto. En cuanto a su altura, consta de tres plantas de viviendas, además de una entreplanta con fines comerciales.&lt;br/&gt;Cada extremo del local dispone de una gran puerta enrejada de hierro forjado, con un gran adorno en la pate superior en el que se leen las iniciales del nombre de Gabriel Lodares. Los locales están separados por columnas renacentistas con adornos modernistas y neobarrocas historicistas; en las fachadas se encuentran representados grandes fruteros y grupos de niños sosteniendo guirnaldas. Los herrajes del balcón principal fueron diseñados por el artesano rejero albacetense D. José Tejados. En el interior hay otras figuras alegóricas en forma de cariátides que presentan la Industria, con una rueda dentada; la Riqueza de la Tierra, portando una cornucopia; las Artes Poéticas, tocando una Lira y, por último, las Artes Liberales, sosteniendo una pequeña escultura y un martillo, todo ello se complementa con numerosas cabezas de Mercurio, dios del comercio.&lt;br/&gt;El Pasaje de Lodares de Albacete es, junto al Pasaje Gutiérrez de Valladolid, y al Pasaje del Ciclón de Zaragoza uno de los tres únicos ejemplos de este tipo de galerías que se conservan en España.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Información sacada de &quot;Wikipedia&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le &lt;strong&gt;port de Biganos&lt;/strong&gt;, une des perles du bassin, se cache bien: il faut savoir y aller et découvrir le minuscule panneau qui indique la bonne direction. Comme tous les ports ostréicoles du bassin, il est fait de cabanes que leurs occupants s'attachent à préserver. Il est en plein dans le delta de la Leyre, cette rivière qui nourrit le bassin. Les bateaux se nichent dans les méandres de ses canaux à l'ombre d'arbres superbes. Ce petit paradis est un coin béni de Dieu et ignoré de nombre de touristes...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vous pouvez pique niquer sous les arbes soit près du parking soit le long du port. Promenade superbe le long du port et dans les bois.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;La cache est entre le port et la Leyre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It may have been left or eroded by the previous Ice Age. Since 1900 the rock has split and been shaped by the wind and water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rock is below the Purbeck Golf Course bridleway access leading to the Wadmore Lane footpath past it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The views from the rock are right across from the Isle of Wight , Bournemouth, Poole and towards the Arne Peninsular. The changes in weather enhance the ever changing views of sunrises, sunsets and rainbows.   </groundspeak:long_description>

The site is adjacent to the Forestry Commission bridleway and archaelogically significant. Our ancesters who created the heath from its original Scots Pine woodland also excavated the clay for the pottery business locally and on the continent. The clay was removed by horse and cart and taken to Poole Harbour for onward shipping and processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you walk quietly you will see the Sika deer, who often hide in the gorse or look for their hoof prints in the sand. All six species of reptiles live on the heathland, especially the smooth snake and common lizard.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Garmin Geocache sealable plastic container </groundspeak:long_description>

The erosion from Old Harry and South beach has been deposited cutting off the sea by a metre a year and leaving Littlesea as a lagoon. Though not very deep it provides a unique species habitat with our own Otters, Crested Grebes, Herons and Egrets which can be seen from the five bird hides.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Garmin Geocache sealable plastic container  </groundspeak:long_description>

Parking also by the road (50.78605,-1.388308) (N 50° 47.163 W 001° 23.298) by Brickyard Creek with short (600m) walk east along beach, from this direction only just (but always) passable at high tide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is rich with oysters, oystercatchers and, bizarrely, a cuttlefish graveyard. This is where the Beaulieu river meets the Solent, the coastal mudflats and areas of saltmarsh being protected by Needs Oar Point and Gull island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above the beach, at the end of Gypsy Lane, there are views over the Solent to the Isle of Wight, Cowes, Yarmouth and Hurst Castle on a clear day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a moist spot so please seal the log book and cache sheet in the plastic bag and after secreting the cache put a few dead leaves back over it so it's properly hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When logging your visit please record the birdlife (and any other wildlife) you have seen, especially if it hasn't been spotted before. There are many waterbirds to be seen, depending on the season:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oystercatchers, Heron, Little Egret, Great crested Grebe, Cormorant, Greenshank, Redshank, Knot, Gulls, Shelduck, Wigeon, Redwing, Fieldfare, Partridge and many others</groundspeak:long_description>

Saw no oystercatchers on walk to gz but heard them. Arrived at GZ and suddenly not a bird to be heard all was silent. Quickly found cache and signed log and on way back did see oystercatchers.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Although a lot of people notice St. Agatha's, probably on their way into the Cascades car park, I think very few take the time to have a look around the small gardens. They're a bit neglected, but especially striking in spring when the whole area is covered in cherry blossom. The cache is not accessible by wheelchair, but it's only a few metres from the path so prams and pushchairs are fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a 35mm film canister. Cache contains just a logbook so bring your own pen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St Agatha’s, Landport, is an historic church in the Landport district of Portsmouth. Originally situated in an area of extreme deprivation, today it stands proudly alone, the &quot;Cathedral of the car parks&quot; in the city’s shopping district. A magnificent building, it replaced a much simpler mission church. The church was built due to the inspirational leadership of Father Robert William Radclyffe Dolling, an Irish Anglo-Catholic priest whose social conscience lead him to fight against a range of domestic ills for his impecunious parishioners. At the same time he was able to charm astonishing amounts of money out of the wealthy residents of nearby Old Portsmouth. The inside was equally sumptuous but the intensity of the ritual lead to a row with the Bishop of Winchester. His successor Father Tremenheere continued to beautify the interior until 1914 when another long serving incumbent arrived. Father C.W Coles was to serve the parish through two world wars until 1954 when the last service was held. For the next 40 years it became a naval store until the Traditional Anglican Communion took it over for a form of worship very similar to that originally provided by Dolling. It is also used for concerts, but faces an uncertain future as its locale is developed as part of the &quot;Northern Quarter&quot; initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun fact: the reason the outside windows are so high is that it used to adjoin other buildings - indeed, the trellis on one side can be seen to conceal these places.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Nice easy find, but the log is completely soaked and nearly full, just managed to sign the log.

Found it after a little searching during which I felt rather conspicuous with rows of traffic either side. I had been hoping there would be a seat near here so I could eat my lunch while working out where I thought it might be, but no such luck!

Don't worry though; It's on the side furthest from the ranges! Cache is easily accessible although probably not wheelchair-friendly. There are a few brambles and stinging nettles around before you get to the coast but the footpaths are usually clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bear in mind you do not need to pass through the sailing club to reach the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an area that I've become quite fond of in the past year or so - a nice little piece of Portsmouth that few people seemingly bother with. Nearby are the Tipner Ranges and a school, as well as a sailing club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a bit of interesting history to this area - an additional junction from the M275 was left unfinished. You can read more about this here and here and see photos of where it should have been here (check out the bottom ones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a transparent lock-lid Tupperware container about 15x15x10cm. At time of hiding it contained a keyring calculator, a Spider-man pin badge, and a copy of Wanted as a treat for the FTF. It also contains a 27-shot disposable camera, so please take some pictures of yourself and of the scenery! The first two pictures are of myself and fellow cacher sciolilingua. Please mention in your log how many pictures are left on the camera!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Taken from Wikipedia:

&quot;Hilsea railway station is a railway station in Portsmouth, England with a limited service. It serves the northern end of Portsea Island, including a large industrial estate nearby.

It is located on the Portsmouth Direct Line which runs between London (London Waterloo) and Portsmouth (Portsmouth Harbour). There were extensive sidings at Hilsea during the Second World War.

This train station is mainly used by commuters who work in nearby Anchorage Park industrial estate. Only stopping trains stop here. This station is rarely manned, only in its peaked hours between 6 and 7am.

Historically, during the &quot;Battle of Havant&quot;, Hilsea was the terminus of an omnibus link from Denvilles Halt, just east of Havant. When the Portsmouth Direct Line had been constructed by the LSWR, at the request of the residents of Portsmouth, it was necessary that trains run from the Portcreek Junction railway triangle, to Havant Junction, along track owned by the rival LBSCR. The latter firm refused to allow that and engaged in militant obstruction of the track to prevent the running of a through train service for several months.&quot;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Unlike our other caches this one IS suitable for pushchairs and the
walk to the cache is on tarmac or hardpack paths. It will entail a
walk of approx 1km each way following the paths although you can
cut the corners across the grass if you want to. 
&lt;p&gt;Recommend parking is at N50.50.814 W001.09.325. To get there
take the road down past Cams Hill School (Shearwater Avenue) and
follow it all the way to the very end where you should end up in a
gravel car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is a cliplock sandwich box which is suitable
for smaller swaps only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of Muggles, especially at the cache location and enjoy
the view.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Ah ha! I returned for a second visit to grab this one after the clue reappeared on the listing page having been missing the previous day (Thanks Colin). I quickly located the cache, signed the log and replaced as found. The co-ords seemed slightly out on my GPSr but there are a lot of trees about. More dog walkers about today but I managed to retrieve and replace the cache in a lull. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

There are roads and footpaths which may be muddy in places. Take
your binoculars for the birds. While placing this cache I saw
little egrets, ducks, teal, brent geese and a curlew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a sandwich box 6&quot; x 6&quot; x 3&quot; wrapped in camouflage
material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the above co-ordinates and walk north to the signpost
and answer the following questions which will give you the
co-ordinates of the micro cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = The number of black sections/rings on the pole of the
signpost (between the bottom of the pointing signs and the
ground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = The number of red sections/rings on the pole of the signpost
(between the bottom of the pointing signs and the ground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = The number of pointing signs on the post x 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = The number of letters in the name of the lane on the sign
pointing South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = The number of letters on the sign pointing West +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = The number of letters on the sign pointing East -13&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on Wickham Common and can be approached from 2 different directions.  The choice of parking is as follows:
&lt;p&gt;1.  Approach the common from the B2177 road between Wickham and Southwick turning down the track opposite the Hundred Acres road. Parking co-ordinates are N50 53.640 W001 09.748.  The route to the cache is longer steeper from this side.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.  Alternatively approach the cache from Forest Lane parking at N50 53.421 W001 10.004 (This is also the parking for &quot;Wickham Wander&quot; so if you haven't already done it I recommend you do).  This is the shorter and flatter approach to the cache.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache is the usual ammo box chock full of goodies.  Might be a bit tough going with a pushchair and a bit of mud in winter or after wet weather.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Found it....well I spotted it first and then it took me a while to actually get to it without painfully damaging myself too much!

*Way* too many stingy &amp; spikey things around here!! :o/

Took Eraser, Left Bracelet.
Dropped off Chuffy Jr. TB to make friends with the horses in the nearby field while he's waiting to be picked up!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache can be accessed from many paths making it a much shorter or longer walk if you look at an os map.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If Parking in Station Road, there is a style to cross, a field that is often muddy and there are roots in parts of the path so this is not suitable for buggies or wheelchairs. The cache can also be accessed from Daggons Road which is a slightly easier and less muddy route&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a cache have placed on one of our early morning walks.  It’s a peaceful area and in April the primroses on the old railway embankment are lovely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If using the parking  on Station Road, follow the path through the woods. Cross the style and follow the footpath across the field and take the left path up onto the old railway embankment. At N50.54.882 W1.50.059 there is a small stream to jump and a broken fence to negotiate. The old railway track has trees down across it, although still negotiable most walkers are using the above route. There is a clear footpath to within 30ft of the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a small tupperware container suitable for small swaps and trackables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden in woodland my gps said the accuracy is 9ft but if you feel the co ordinates are off please let me know. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To allow the wildlife peace no night caching please. </groundspeak:long_description>

I'd read about the signal in this area, but for me it was good. Had the hint, but did not need it.

Was nice to walk a different part of the forest than our normal haunts. We were the first to sign the book :-) Did not take anything because we had nothing to leave.

Terrain in this part of the forest was very boggy despite it being August, take decent walking shoes!</groundspeak:text>

Possible with a pushchair with a struggle.&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a lock lock style container clearly marked containing some swaps. Also I've included a Munzee ( see www.munzee.com) for all the smart phone users to claim.&lt;br/&gt;Please note that this cache has been placed in accordance with the GAGB agreement with the Forestry commission.

We walked through from the top of the hill at Piper's Wait, but used the Munzee coordinates as Open Caching appeared to have removed the three &quot;Nibbles&quot; (finally logging this two days later).   I guess we can amend the Terrain rating as the long dry spell is coming to an end and the mud is returning, but the tree cover still defeated my smart phone GPS.  Not sure on &quot;Awesomeness&quot; rating, I'm sur e &quot;Fine&quot; (in English) is equivalent to something &quot;Volcanic&quot; in Garmin.Inc
Had expected to see a few deer, but very quiet today, although the autumn colours made it a delight and Ricky enjoyed chasing the leaves.

It is a mixed woodland which includes many different tree species, from the easily recognisable Oak and Beech to the less well-known Wild Cherry and Japanese Larch. Due to the variety of species the trees from this wood could be used as many things such as telegraph poles, boats, oak barns, tables, fences and firewood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodland covers 99 hectares (244 acres) and has an interesting landscape including valleys, streams and attractive views from the northern edge across the adjourning farmland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wood is full of interesting wildlife some of the more common animals you may either see or find evidence of are fallow, roe and muntjac deer, foxes, rabbits, bats, reptiles, butterflies and many species of birds. Look up and you might be lucky enough to see a Buzzard or Kestrel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had good fun locating a spot for this. It should be pretty easy to get to, although the paths and wooded area can become boggy when it rains. A favourite for muggles and their muggle-type dogs, so beware. Thankfully the spot itself is pretty well hidden amongst the undergrowth off the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed with the kind permission of the Forestry Commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*cache size increased to hold swappables as per fellow geocachers requests =)*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;small/medium click-lock container - log, pencil(s) &amp; swappables.

It is a mixed woodland which includes many different tree species, from the easily recognisable Oak and Beech to the less well-known Wild Cherry and Japanese Larch. Due to the variety of species the trees from this wood could be used as many things such as telegraph poles, boats, oak barns, tables, fences and firewood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woodland covers 99 hectares (244 acres) and has an interesting landscape including valleys, streams and attractive views from the northern edge across the adjourning farmland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wood is full of interesting wildlife some of the more common animals you may either see or find evidence of are fallow, roe and muntjac deer, foxes, rabbits, bats, reptiles, butterflies and many species of birds. Look up and you might be lucky enough to see a Buzzard or Kestrel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed with the kind permission of the Forestry Commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small round click-lock type container. Small swapables please. Please replace anything that may be hiding the cache. =) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2PJ4Y&quot;&gt;Also appears on geocaching.com&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a fairly easy to find cache with the aim of taking you to a
great location with fantastic view of Cranbury Park a forma home of
Sir Isaac Newton. Happy hunting in this great little
area. &lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;You must
&lt;strong&gt;only repeat only&lt;/strong&gt;
approach this cache from either end of the footpath that runs
across the Cranbury estate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The best approach is from the Otter Pub at &lt;strong&gt;50°59.913'N,
1°21.226'W&lt;/strong&gt; they have a large car park at the rear of the
pub. I am sure if you just let them know you will be popping back
for a pint after a quick walk, they will not mind you parking in
their car park. There are however a number of other small parking
space around this area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You could also start by parking at the Church at
&lt;strong&gt;51°00.155'N, 1°21.034'W&lt;/strong&gt; at walk up the hill
visiting Virtually a Cache ( GCE5EE ) on your way to Dib Dib
Dib.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a third option you could start the walk from the Ladwell end
&lt;strong&gt;51°00.796'N, 1°23.343'W&lt;/strong&gt; of the footpath. There is
just about room for one car to park as long as you do not block of
assess to the gate. This is an ideal start if you can be dropped
off and walk across to the Otter pub some 3.7km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbury Park map link here&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The cache is a small plastic container with a number of small
items and log book in place, small swaps only please. As noted
previously the aim of the Dib Dib Dib cache is to bring you to a
great area that is almost a secret to many who live in the
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the
History of
&lt;b&gt;Cranbury Park, Hampshire&lt;/b&gt; by Michael Ford.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; C R A N B U R Y&lt;br /&gt; P A R K&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Home of Sir Isaac
Newton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year Cranbury Park, South of
Winchester in the Parish of Hursley, opens its gardens to the
public for their enjoyment and for the support of various
charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visit on a nice day, as it was
this year (1999), is a delight. Unfortunately the house is not open
so its magnificent interior cannot be seen, which is a shame as
Pevsner describes it as an 'unforgettable experience' to behold the
hall with its coffered tunnel-vaults to the full height of the
house and the beautiful ballroom. It is however possible to arrange
a bed and breakfast stay as guests of the owner Mrs
Chamberlayne-Macdonald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is built in a very red brick with stone
     dressings. The entrance is through a porte-cochere either side
     of which are large columned windows with roundels in relief
     above each and above the porch. Balustrades surmounted by urns
     run around the parapet, framing the whole house to give a very
     pleasing prospect within the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house we see today was built in
1780 for Lady Dance-Holland the wife of Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland
the painter and the brother of George Dance who is believed to be
its architect. Cranbury Park, before this time has an interesting
history as the home of Sir Isaac Newton, England's great
philosopher, during his latter years, until his death in 1727. One
of his former pupils, Jonathan Conduitt, married Sir Isaac's
half-niece and adopted daughter Catherine Barton in
1717.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his death
     the property was bought by Mr Lee Dummer and it was a Dummer
     who purchased medieval masonry from Netley Abbey for his
     collection of historic monuments. Today in the grounds can be
     seen these fragments which he had re-erected in the 1760s,
     some being incorporated into a picturesque tower with the
     others forming a wall of arches taken from the North transept
     of the Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chamberlaynes came to live at Cranbury Park
     around 1800 and are still in residence. The pleasure grounds
     were laid out in 1815 and are thought to be by Papworth. The
     sundial in the garden displays the Conduitt coat of arms and
     was calculated by Sir Isaac Newton himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The
Garden of Cranbury Park is normally open for one day only in June.
Enquire locally for details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I parked near the Otter pub and walked over the noisy M3 motorway. It was nice to hear the sound of the motorway diminish as I made my way to the cache location. My GPSr pointed to an obvious hiding place, so I put my had in and startled both myself and the occupant! I then realised that, although I had an up to date cache print-out, my GPSr hadn't got the updated coordinates. So I put the correct ones in and found the new location straight away. I must say both the old and new locations were excellent hiding spots.

Thanks for bringing me to this interesting place.

Monarch's Way in Hursley. &lt;br /&gt; It is recommended that you park in the south end of village, there
are plenty of places including a pub called The Dolphin. 
&lt;p&gt;You should head for the start of the path system :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 51° 01.258&lt;br /&gt;
W 001° 23.592&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start you need to head for the feature (the co-ords for
the start fo the multi cache)at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 51° 01.171&lt;br /&gt;
W 001° 23.956&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this feature you need to count the number (xx) of boards
there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have this number (xx) work out the final cache location
from the co-ords below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Cache (ammo box - with a stack of swaps in)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 51° 01.023&lt;br /&gt;
W 001° xx (the number of boards -10).641&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Story of the Monarch's Way is that it was use in the escape of
Charles II after the Battle of Worcester in 1651.&lt;br /&gt;
For six exciting weeks, and hotly pursued by the Parliamentary
forces under Oliver Cromwell, he travelled first north, then south
through the Cotswolds and the Mendips to the South Coast, and
finally along the South Downs to Shoreham where he made his escape
to France. Loyally supported by his followers, many at great risk
to their own lives, he was given shelter in places both great and
humble, many of which still exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details about this long distance path, which is some 615
miles long, can be found at the following links.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Kebleland cash starts with a Nano placed in All Saints' Church,
Hursley grounds (not inside). &lt;br /&gt; The cash is named after John Keble (25 April 1792 – 29 March 1866)
was an English churchman and poet, one of the leaders of the Oxford
Movement, and gave his name to Keble College, Oxford. 
&lt;p&gt;In 1835 he was appointed Vicar of Hursley, Hampshire, where he
settled down to family life and remained for the rest of his life
as a parish priest at All Saints Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Shakespeare has done for Stratford-on-Avon - John Keble has
done for Hursley. But on going to Hursley one also finds, linked to
the same locality fascinating associations of historic characters,
such as &quot; Tumbledown Dick &quot; Cromwell, Thomas Sternhold, Sir Isaac
Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hursley is a typical English village, and the records of the
centuries of their history are of the kind that go to make the
history of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Keble died in Bournemouth at the Hermitage Hotel, after
visiting the area to try and recover from a long term illness as he
believed the sea air had therapeutic qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you're searching for the nano cache you will see close by
John Keble’s and his wife’s graves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house that Keble used to live in can be found just behind
the church. The local school is also named after Keble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a book called &quot;All Saints' Church, Hursley -
History and Guide&quot; by Stan.C.Rawdon, unfortunately Stan died last
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can park close to the church, follow the road that leads up
the side of the Parish Hall and you will see parking at the rear
entrance to the church. You can remain parked here for the final
hunt also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE When looking for the final cache approach from the park
gate just in front of the village hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see more about Hursley at the village website
http://www.hursleyvillage.info&lt;/p&gt;
NOTE : Please carefully put the NANO back in the same
place.&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: K121QJJ - Kebleland&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

And , of course, everyone who came along wants to be able to log it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not too surprisingly, it's not all that far from last year's, and if you plan to do BOTH, then I'd recommend doing GCMJYQ *FIRST* and *THEN* do this one! In both cases, you should start from the public path, just opposite the Cart &amp; Horses pub in Kingsworthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike lst year's cache, which had one bit that was rather a stinker, thus one is really simple... it would have been a 1/1 but for the fact that a large part of the track is rather narrow and muddy, and not at all suitable for *anything* with wheels on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please cover the cache well when you replace it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you walk on another couple of hundred yards, you'll come to the two bridges that take the A33/A34 over the River Itchen. This is the &quot;Three Castles Path&quot; that follows the southern side of the River Itchen from the Abbots Worthy area down to WInchester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another cache, now called &quot;A Tiny Itchen&quot; (GCTA70), was placed as a &quot;bonus cache&quot; to this one, at the 2006 Cache-Bash. It's only 3 or 4 minutes walk up the path, by the bridges mentioned above, so why not do it after you've found this one? </groundspeak:long_description>

Wellies or similar are suggested in wet periods, although much of the path is fairly ok. The total walk (there &amp; back) is a little over 1km, and should take you about 45 minutes to an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache not really suitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs, as many bits of the paths are quite narrow or uneven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates given for the cache are for the first clue: there is a small layby about 50 yards towards the junction, with space for a couple of cars. You'll also spot a pub just over the road!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first location, you need to cross the A33: whilst this is often quite quiet, cars travel very fast, so please take care when crossing the dual carriageway, especially if you have children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A signpost clearly shows where the footpath continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Go to N51.05.378 W1 17.751&lt;br/&gt;Look for a sign that tells you “Unity is Strength – 188A”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A =&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Go to N51.05.379 W1 17.392&lt;br/&gt;On a sign, you will find that the “Site Reference” is “10B27C”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B =&lt;br/&gt;C =&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Not far away, at N51 5.349 W1 17.380 you will find a sign, explaining that this specific area is an SSSI: but how many times does the letter “v” appear on the sign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D =&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Go to N51 5.163 W1 17.400 Add together the number of vertical wooden posts and the number of fingers on the signpost&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E = &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) Go to N51 5.193 W1 17.327 where you will find a micro-cache with the next instructions!!

Parked by the church just up from the pub.
Fun gathering the clues on route, a lovely walk too.
Especially enjoyed walking through the cottage garden over the bridge - what a beautiful spot.
We got a bit muddled at one stage.  Because we counted a clue incorrectly, we calculated the final cache over the river some 150' away [:O]
However, after re-reading the clue and recalculating, we headed off down the path a short way and located the cache without further difficulty.

The only TB in the cache was Scavenger Hunt Tiger.

 &lt;br /&gt;        

&lt;br /&gt;
 The Torpedo Shed, Worthy Down Camp, Winchester, Hampshire.
National Grid Reference: SU 47006 35535&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Parking&lt;br /&gt;
 There is plenty of parking at 51°07.090'N,
1°19.562'W just as you enter onto the playing area. This is
a fairly busy area for dog walkers, runners etc so you might need
to keep your wits about you when visiting both the micro and final
cache.

&lt;p&gt;Starting this
cache&lt;br /&gt;
 There is a tricky micro cache to start you off
with. This can be found at: 51°06.998'N, 1°19.939'W. On
your way to the micro you will see the area where the Torpedo Sheds
once stood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the details from the micro it will
take you on a short walk past other remains of the Torpedo Shed
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should find the final cache without any
problems, after which it will be a short walk back to the car
park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for placing this cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. There is a lot of history around this area, in
particular the Torpedo Shed (see full details below)&lt;br /&gt;
 b. There is a great and very well kept play park for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to the Torpedo
Sheds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


The MOD had been asked by
Hampshire Constabulary to take action to prevent&lt;br /&gt;
 vandalism and unlawful entry to the former Torpedo Shed at Worthy
Down Camp. MOD&lt;br /&gt;
 surveyors had indicated that the building is beyond economic
repair and no alternative&lt;br /&gt;
 use can be found. The structure was to be collapsed in on itself
and the rubble buried by&lt;br /&gt;
 the spoil from the surrounding earth bund banks. This was
completed by the end of&lt;br /&gt;
 March 2000.

Context One Archaeological Services (COAS)
carried out an archaeological building survey at the Torpedo Shed,
Worthy Down Camp, Winchester, Hampshire (SU 47006 35535) between
24-25 March 2000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The historical importance of this building at regional and national
level is unknown. However the building is comparatively early in
the history of military aviation, being pre- WW2. In addition it
does not appear to have been altered and many of the internal
fittings survive. It is certainly a building of local importance
and therefore it is considered necessary to produce an archival
record in advance of its imminent demolition.'


&lt;p&gt;Site Location and
Topography&lt;br /&gt;
The Torpedo Shed occupies gently sloping ground on the northern
edge of the former Worthy Down Airfield, just south of South
Wonston at NGR SU 47006 35535 (Figure 1). The site is bounded to
the north by South Wonston Playing fields; 500m to the south-east
is Worthy Down Camp, and Race Course Cottages lie 300m to the west.
The Torpedo Shed lies approximately 90m above OS Datum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site covers an area of 550 square metres and
lies within a network of military storage depots and access routes
around the northern perimeter of the former Worthy Down Airfield.
To the east of the Torpedo Shed lies a former components shed
(AM1817/34), which has now been filled for health and safety
reasons, and a former fusing shed which was once linked to the
Torpedo Shed by a track (1503/AA1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical
background&lt;br /&gt;
 In 1917, 480 acres of the Old Winchester racecourse were developed
into an airfield as part of the military camp at Worthy Down. Six
aeroplane sheds were erected together with a large hangar. The
airfield was first used by the Wireless and Observers School in
1918, but the armistice brought their residence to an end. In 1924,
the site was re-activated when '58 Squadron' used it as a base for
'Vickers Vimy' aircraft. This squadron was soon joined by 'No. 7
Squadron' with 'Vickers Virginias'. 'No. 7 Squadron' stayed and
received the 'Handley Page Heyford' in 1935, before being joined by
No. '49 Squadron' and the 'Hawker Hind' bomber. Between 1926 and
1935, there was a gradual build up at the airfield. Married
quarters and new administration blocks were erected. In 1936, the
airfield was transferred to 'No. 2 Group, Bomber Command'. The
bombers left in 1938, and 'Avro Ansons' arrived in their place
(Brooks 1996, 143). The airfield was transferred to the Admiralty
in 1939, becoming HMS Kestrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luftwaffe bombed the airfield in August 1940,
unaware that it was a training base. It was the only attack the
base ever suffered. The airfield became one of the hosts to the
'Supermarine Spitfire' during the Second World War, after its
primary base at Eastleigh endured regular enemy bombing raids. Many
of the early trials of the 'Seafire' were also carried out at
Worthy Down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMS Kestrel closed in November 1947, re-opening in
June 1952 as HMS Ariel. This ground training establishment closed
in 1960 when it was handed over to the Royal Army Pay Corps who
still operate the site (Brooks 1996, 11).&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is placed on land owned by my employer and is in a position where occasionally I'll be able to see visitors to it. The cache is in a camouflaged click lock container and contains a FTF Certificate, a toy car, a silver half dollar from 1965, a trolley key ring, 2 mini Post-it notes, and log book and pencil. The cache isn't suitable for wheelchair users and care should be taken when approaching the cache, there is no footpath but you can walk on the grass verges. I recommend parking at N51 25.720 W001 05.466 which is in a quiet lane then walking back to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

the church of St Martin which was demolished in 1896 in order to
widen the road and improve traffic flow. The tower was renovated
following this and visitors today, for a small charge can climb the
99 steps to the top of the tower which offers some wonderful views
over Oxford. There are two figures known as “quarter
boys” on the front of the tower that strike the quarter
hours. On the second floor of the tower is an exhibition on its
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a magnetic
micro placed in a very busy part of Oxford so stealth will be
required when retrieving and replacing this cache. The magnet is
seriously strong, so if you can't remove the cache you'll have to
log a DNF. Do NOT try to slide the pot off the magnet as you'll
break it.&lt;/p&gt;

Walked on from &quot;Can Rabbits Climb Trees?&quot;. As the path seem to go across a crop field but no signs of it, I went round the edge.

Peaceful at cache site with the sound of bird song in the wood :) No problem finding the cache and duly signed the log.

I then used the bridleway to get back to my car, making a nice circular walk.

As there are no other logs on this site for this cache, it looks like a FTF.

Will OpenCaching catch on?

However it is close enough to the road for a quick cache and dash. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our very first cache and De Boyz Jnrs special one. Don't ask me about the title, that was his idea but as he wrote about where it is 'I'm next to a gate, see lots of cars, buses and lorries and have lived here for many, many years'. Is a small official Geocaching click top container in a camo bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closest parking is a little up the road opposite the first turning for North Leigh going away from Witney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks and please enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

It is placed near the far side of the field from the parking area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is a clip-lock design and is partly buried at the base of a tree, so it's probably easier once found to leave it in place, remove the lid and take a look inside (either that, or take a spade with you!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muggles often use the field as there is a small play area in one corner and space to play football, so some stealth may be necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On placement there are various &quot;swag&quot; items inside. Feel free to swap these with items of similar or greater value, but please mention what you took/left behind when you log your visit online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please also remember to fill out the log book.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As World War 2 approached Britain needed new airfields and the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works began to look for land. Bitteswell was identified as a suitable site and in 1940 construction on the airfield began.&lt;br /&gt;In June 1941, the airfield opened despite there being no water or electricity.  Local residents in Bitteswell and Ullesthorpe were angry that their quick route to the A5 had to be closed as it crossed the airfield.Eventually water and electricity were installed and on 12th August 1941 the first night flight took place. However as the weather worsened with the onset of winter the grass runways became dangerous and flying was suspended.  Flying resumed in April 1943.&lt;br /&gt;By 1946 the company Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Ltd had begun to make and test aircraft on the site. In the 1950s the production of aircraft had grown so much that Lutterworth residents began to complain about the noise. In 1956 Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft bought the aerodrome outright, but by 1962 orders for the planes made there had begun to drop and redundancies were inevitable.).  &lt;br /&gt;In 1968 the RAF allowed planes (Gnats) used by the Red Arrows display team to be serviced over the winter at Bitteswell, this continued until 1972. A new public house in Lutterworth was subsequently named in their honour. &lt;br /&gt;By March 1983 the aerodrome had completely closed. The following year the land had been bought by Douglas Arnold who intended to use the aerodrome primarily for vintage aircraft. However it was resold in1986 and the MFI bought the land to develop the distribution centre, Magna park..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is at what would have been the north east end of the main runway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTF honours go to &quot;Rich Uder Smith&quot;, good on yer.&lt;br /&gt;STF Goes to redvark

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the site of a large tree that was chopped down over thirty
years ago. The trunk that remained to rot looked like an elephant,
hence the name. This area holds many childhood memories for us.

Can't believe we missed this last time, or how many other places we looked!!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emcache.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache, named after a white female cat called Sam, is not far
from the track that leads between Hathern and the Garendon Estate.
This trail is not accessible by car and has to be walked to from
either Shepshed or loughborough. Wheelchairs and buggies should be
fine, though cache resting place would be tricky to reach from a
wheelchair. From Loughborough:-If travelling by car, the closest
place to park is probably on Mount Grace Road by the entrance to
the wildlife area. If using a wheelchair or buggy then you should
park at Coe Avenue, Loughborough and follow the lane by the old dry
stone wall. If coming from Shepshed, park on Butthole Lane (N 52°
46.414, W 001° 17.222 ) and follow the bridalway going over the M1
motorway. The area around this wonderful site is currently under
threat of yet another housing development on this lovely Wildlife
Corridor. Keep an eye out for the Buzzarrd who lives in the area!
Cache contains a log book and an assortment of small treasures.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[spoiler] Standing on the bridge looking south the cache is in a conduit opening (not visible from track) that empties into the shallow ditch on the left a few metres ahead of you.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We'd actually been quite close to this earlier in the year when chasing the Shepy series, without realising it.

JJBJr had his mitts on the GPSr and soon plunged off the path, and in seconds came up with the box; he's on a roll today!

Meanwhile moved down the path towards this one. We'd done some research and had a short list of what kind of thing it might be; coming up to GZ, and looking at the terrain rating, we wondered where we might have to go for this.
We needn't have worried; while we were debating this JJBJr simply followed the arrow and said 'do you think it might be this?' and revealed the container.

We definitely feel superfluous today!!!

Finally had the area to ourselves, so we made the most of it, and to save time we sent in JJBJr, who, surprise surprise, had the cache in hand in seconds; he must have had a

And worse was to come!!

First one on our walk through from the layby on the A6; few muggles around but when we reached GZ JJBJr soon darted off the path and came up with the refurbished container.

This is a great location for a cache with great views over Derbyshire and Leicestershire.&lt;br /&gt;
There used to be a cache nearby called &quot;The Departure Lounge&quot; GCH4F1, but the ammo box was stolen and it has been archived since May 2006. Its too good a view not to have a cache.&lt;br /&gt;
You will not need to leave the paths and it is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; in the churchyard. Please read clue, if you have moved more than 1 stone and cannot see it then you are in the wrong place. Do not dismantle the wall!
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates had accuracy of 6 feet when i set it, the signal was very strong and was picking up WAAS correction (thats one for the geeks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The priory church of St Mary &amp; St Hardulph is dramatically sited on a limestone hill being cut-away by the quarry below and can be seen for many miles.&lt;br /&gt;
The hill has been occupied for thousands of years and the present church is not the first. In 675 a monastery was founded on the hill with Hedda as the first Abbot. The monastery is mentioned in the Anglo Saxon Chronicles and due to its importance various saints were also buried here. The monastery fell into decline after the Danes ransacked the region including probably Breedon itself. But by 966-7 King Edgar (first King of all England) gave Bishop Aethelwold land which included Breedon and the monastery was either revived or re-founded.&lt;br /&gt;
After the Norman Conquest Breedon passed to the Augustinian Priory at Nostell in Yorkshire. In 1122 they founded an Augustinian Priory at Breedon and some sign of this can be seen on the west side if the tower. In fact there would have been other buildings leading from all sides of the tower with cloisters and domestic quarters. In the 13th century a wide new chancel was built to the east of the tower and this is now the present church. In the 15th century the clerestory windows were added as well as the aisles.&lt;br /&gt;
The priory fell into some disrepair by the 16th century, but a local family in the form of Francis Shirley Esq of Staunton Harold Hall purchased the priory from King Henry VIII after the Reformation as a burial place for himself and his successors. The local villagers also petitioned that the building should become their parish church (as the village church was ruinous) and the rooms above the south porch could be used as a school - this was accepted. They pulled down the old buildings to the west of the tower but removed the Saxon carvings which they placed in the south porch. In 1784 the church was again in a bad state of repair, there were plans to spend £3,340 on the rebuild but this sum was never reached, however the church was repaired and this is what we can see today. Some further restoration took place in the 19th and 20th centuries, and in 1937 the Saxon carvings were moved from the south porch and placed in the main part of the church. The present church consists of a west tower, south porch (with vestry over), nave, north aisle (Shirley aisle), south aisle with Lady Chapel and a Sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;

Took me a little time to find as the GPSr was a little jumpy and only managed 6' accuracy and as per description I didn't want to disturb the wall too much. Noted only one trackable but didn't discover it so not sure which it was. Great views today as the fog had lifted a treat, still a little hazy but never mind.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the A512, turn down to Barrow upon Trent and drive down
past the pub.&lt;br /&gt;
As the road swings right you will need to go straight on to the
church. Just before you do, you will see on the right an attractive
run of ten Grade II listed cottages, known as &quot;The Row&quot;. These are
owned by the Parish Council and rented to people with village
connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go straight on to the church and on the right opposite the
church gate you will see &quot;The Pinfold&quot;, a small walled area
originally used for holding stray cattle.&lt;br /&gt;
The road continues left past the church and you will soon see a
lane on the right heading south. You can go up here in a car but
there is only limited parking.&lt;br /&gt;
It is best to park at the start of the lane on the wide grass
verges and then walk up the lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lane is popular with local dog walkers but other than that,
it is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;
Just before the gate across the end of the lane there is another
gate on the right. There are signs on the gate saying &quot;No Fishing&quot;,
&quot;No Cycling&quot; and &quot;Danger - Deep Water&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Go in here and follow the well maintained path until you come to a
large enclosed meadow area with a small lake in the middle. It was
an old quarry but it is now a haven for waterfowl, you will usually
see ducks, swans, geese and coots. You can follow the path all the
way around the water for a nice pleasant walk at all times of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small preform with screwtop know in these parts
as a &quot;Friedel&quot; after our big friendly German supplier!&lt;br /&gt;
Contains a logbook and pen but no room for swops.&lt;/p&gt;

Respected the &quot;No Cycling&quot; sign and locked my bike up at the gate. I did wonder on the way to this one why a bigger box had not been placed, but once I noticed the area had limited hiding spots (due to the newly planted trees) plus the fact it could be a flood risk all made sense.

walk begins here. Its a gentle 3.5 mile walk mostly by the canal
and the banks of the River Trent with a couple of roadside
footpaths connecting them.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This used to be a nice big Ammo box stuffed with goodies but it
disappeared in September 2009 without a trace? It has been replaced
with a tuppaware box but in a different location. The 3 clue
locations are the same but the calculation has changed to give a
different final location that is still on the original route.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icache.co.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This small, quiet South Derbyshire village with a population of
less than 200 is set on the banks of the River Trent. Only just
over 250 years ago it was the scene of one of the most momentous
incidents in English history. From the time when James II, the last
Stuart King of England went into exile in France in 1688, the
Jacobites had attempted several times to regain the throne. All had
failed and in 1745, it was the turn of Prince Charles Edward
Stuart, frequently known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, to try to
overthrow the English Monarch. Support for the cause was
half-hearted, but enough clansmen were raised for the march south.
The English though were unprepared for an invasion, most of the
troops were abroad and King George, fearing the worst, was
preparing to return to Germany.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the 4 December 1745, Charles Edward Stuart and his army reached
Derby and made arrangements for the capture of the strategically
important Swarkestone Bridge. It was the only bridge on the River
Trent, between Burton and Nottingham.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unaware of the panic in London, and with no signs of help coming
from France, or a revolt in support of Charles, the Jacobite
generals decided to retreat, despite the protests of their leader.
If the march had continued, it would probably have been successful
and the whole course of British history changed. In memory of this
important event, a cairn has been erected at Swarkestone Bridge, to
mark the southern - most point reached by Bonnie Prince
Charlie's army. The cairn can be found in the gardens of the
Crewe and Harpur Arms, towards the river bank.
&lt;p&gt;Swarkestone Bridge and Causeway, at a length of three quarters
of a mile, is the longest stone bridge in England and holds Grade I
listed building status. There has been a bridge here for 800 years,
and at one time a bridge chapel and toll house stood partway across
the bridge. It is still today an important crossing place.
According to local legend, the building of Swarkestone Bridge in
the 13th century is attributable to two sisters who saw their
lovers drowned trying to cross the River Trent on horseback. They
crossed the flooded meadows safely, but then either missed the ford
altogether, or were swept off by the strong current. The horrified
sisters saw all this happen through a hall window and vowed to
ensure no else met the same fate. They spent the rest of their
lives building the bridge and died penniless as a result.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The River Trent was a busy waterway before the Trent and Mersey
Canal opened down its full length. Boats traded between Burton and
Nottingham, reaching as far afield as Gainsborough, but the
completion of the canal in 1777, slowly killed off the riverboat
trade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few years after the Jacobites retreated, the Crewe and Harpur
Arms was built. It is a fine old coaching inn, and at one time, a
stable block completely encircled its present day car park. This
was used to not only stable carriage horses, but racing horses as
well. Derby then had a Racecourse based near Lowes Farm, on the
northern side of the village.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was at the Lowes, situated on a ridge overlooking the village,
where archaeological excavations in 1955 and 1956 made some
remarkable discoveries. The first was of a Bronze Age burial; a
year later, archaeologists found even more striking evidence of
structures by the Beaker People of about 2000 BC, along with a
small amount of Neolithic pottery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most unusual building in the village is the Summer House,
sometimes called 'The Grandstand'. It has a grass
covered rectangular enclosure in front. No one is quite sure what
its use was; bull baiting and jousting are suggestions. More
likely, the much gentler pursuit of bowling took place there. It is
now in the hands of Landmark Trust and is let for holiday
accommodation. Little remains of the hall, which stood just south
of here, but the Old Hall Farm, built out of part of its remains
still exists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tiny St James Church contains some superb carvings. Sir Richard
Harpur, who was one of Queen Elizabeth's judges, lies in his
judge's gown, on a fine alabaster tomb, with his wife Jane.
They both lived at Swarkestone Hall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
James Brindley died before he could complete the final piece in his
canal network that revolutionised trade in the country. Hugh
Henshall, his brother-in-law, completed the work on the concluding
section of the Trent and Mersey Canal. A milestone marks every mile
along the route to Preston Brook. At Swarkestone Junction, the
former lock house is now a private residence and the old toll bar
cottage the home of Swarkestone Boat Club.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THE ROUTE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. From the initial co-ordinates walk to Swarkestone Lock and head
west (left) along canal towpath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will see a restored crane. On what day in May 1994 was the
restored crane unveiled? This is &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt; in the cache
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Continue along the canal under bridge number 15 (numbers on the
west side) until you reach bridge number 16.&lt;br /&gt;
Along the way you will be able to work out the following:&lt;br /&gt;
If it is 6 miles to Shardlow, how many miles (CD) is it to Preston
Brook?&lt;/p&gt;
This gives you &lt;b&gt;CD&lt;/b&gt; in the cache location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. Leave the canal by the steps at bridge 16 and turn left crossing
over the railway bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Continue down the road until you reach the A5132.
&lt;b&gt;Cross carefully&lt;/b&gt; and walk down into
Barrow-on-Trent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Keep straight on through the village, and down Church Lane
&lt;b&gt;(NOT Chapel Lane)&lt;/b&gt;. Walk around to the church. In the
churchyard find the memorial to George Eric Cowlishaw. (Take the
weight off your feet for a while).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtract one year from the other to get a 2 digit number, this
is &lt;b&gt;EF&lt;/b&gt; in the Cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave the churchyard and continue until the end of the road.
Here follow the narrow footpath by the River Trent, past the
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Private fishing&quot;&lt;/b&gt; sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache location is at:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N52 51.FAB W001 28.(E-D-A)CD&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue along the side of the river and soon you will see the
traffic on the causeway ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Continue following the footpath by the riverbank around the
field to a stone building housing a pump. Cross a stile, then
through a short field to a gap between the houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. On leaving Meadow Farm, turn right into Woodshop Lane passing
in front of the Crewe and Harpur Arms. The commemorative Cairn is
in the garden by the riverbank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Cross the A514 &lt;b&gt;carefully&lt;/b&gt; and follow the footpath along
the riverbank to Swarkestone Church. Look back as you walk along
the riverbank to see the causeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Continue up the lane to the A514. Carefully cross this
&lt;b&gt;very busy road&lt;/b&gt; and go up Pingle Lane to return to the start
of the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy this walk&lt;/p&gt;

Heading to this one from Parkside and the heavens opened! It absolutely chucked it down, I think it is what my dad would call &quot;Stair rods&quot;, and I tucked myself under cover of an Oak tree for shelter. As soon as the rain stopped though, I pushed on the short remaining distance to ground zero for a quick find.

Thanks for the cache,

A neat variation on a hide I've seen before. The log was a VERY tight fit in the cache and it took a lot of effort to extract it.

Decided to cycle over to Wollaton Park in order to grab some of the caches that have sprung up since I was last over. Entered via the parkside entrance, passing a rather sorry looking bike that had been discarded with a twisted back wheel. Soon found myself at ground zero and firstly I located the QR code and scanned that, before then spotting the cache. Neat hide! Logged and headed off to the next!

Once we got to GZ a search of the probable place soon turned up the cache.

Quickly Resolved this puzzle and saw that Batman had departed, so took the opportunity to nip over and have a look for this one. Walked in from Middleton Boulevard to take full advantage of some shade from the sun. Plenty of folks taking full advantage of the weather and the re-opened park, but no worries retrieving the cache at ground zero. Quick Recovery and return of the cache, before heading back out.

&lt;p&gt;Tottle brook is shown on the above map of Wollaton from 1901.
(the &quot;Model Cottage&quot; is directly opposite the cache site). It runs
from up near 
Shaws Plantation, flows through Wollaton, and the 
University Park filling up the 
paddling pool, through Dunkirk and finally into the River
Trent. The brook is easily visible on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org&quot;&gt;Open Street Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking as available in the nearby Bramcote lane shops car park,
on street nearby or in the pub car park just over the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual cache is a nano/micro located near ground level and
is wearing a disguise. &lt;b&gt;Please take extra care making you you
don't drop the cache into the water below!&lt;/b&gt; Bring some Tweezers
(or similar) to get the log out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wollaton Hall is a spectacular Elizabethan mansion in the heart
of Nottingham. It is a prominent Grade One Listed building and
following its major programme of restoration, visitors of all ages
are welcome to visit the hall and park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing on a natural hill three miles west of Nottingham City
Centre, Wollaton Hall is set in five hundred acres of spectacular
gardens and parkland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On site, in addition to the historic hall and its sumptuous
grounds, visitors will find Nottingham's Natural History Museum,
Nottingham's Industrial Museum (Open the last Sunday of each month
for Sunday Steamings) and the Yard Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park opens at 8am on weekdays and 9am at Weekends and Bank
Holidays. The park closes just before it starts to get dark.&lt;/p&gt;

Cycled up towards the Hall and spotted the Ice House cut into the bank, although at first I was a little concerned as it seems to be in use for the storage of wheely bins! However the GPSr stopped a good thirty feet short of it and I soon had the cache located from a very sneaky hidey place. 

Thanks for the cache,

After finding the playing fields cache, my planned route to the Lime Tree Avenue cache took me to the east of the plantation. However, my lack of local knowledge was exposed when I rounded the corner and found my way blocked by the golf course. I therefore amended my route to find this one next.

After dawdling to let a muggle past, the cache was quickly found.

After answering a couple of the stages of the Multi, I headed over to look for the two remaining traditionals, stopping off on the way to grab a photo of the stags sitting on the front garden of the hall. Located this cache without any problems and utilised the hiding place to shield me from some muggles wandering by.

Last of Bobbinz Wollaton Park caches for me and an easy find... or at least it was once I switched to the correct tree [;)]. There was lots of muggle activity all around, but mostly they were keeping themselves to themselves - probably more pre-occupied with the Sedgeway training area!

Thanks for the cache and indeed for the series of caches Bobbinz - most fun!

We performed what must have looked from afar like a family tree-circling dance, but then a tell-tale was noticed and the cache soon retrieved.

The beauty of caches with very little information, is there are so fewer places to have to go looking for the answers! No problems getting this one solved and so as I was on a puzzling mission in Nottingham today, gave it a go! Thankfully most of the snow had gone, which made spotting and retrieving this little cache so much easier. Added my name to the log book and poked the cache back where it came from, before continuing my little tour of the area.

Thanks for the cache,

Halfway round my circuit of Wollaton Hall I diverted to a couple of the Canal caches and to this one. It proved to be the sort of location you might visit a dozen times and be thwarted by muggles every time, but I struck lucky and had the place to myself - that really was fortunate, as it was a tidy step from the park, and I'm unlikely to get here again.

A neat hide, but I quickly spotted it was out of place. Thanks for the cache,

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache in is Wollaton Park. A Deer park in Nottingham, dogs are welcome as are pushchairs etc. Parking is available in the main Wollaton Hall car parks and on Harrow Road, both car parks are within 10 mins walk of the cache. The container is orange, about three inches tall and fairly easy to spot. Should take less than an hour to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wollaton hall is a grand, grade 1 listed, Elizabethan House designed by Robert Smythson and built in 1588 by Sir Francis Willoughby. It is owned by Nottingham city council and contains Nottingham’s natural history musem. There is a Gorilla and a Giraffe to look for. It’s 500 acres of Deer park, lake and gardens are yours to enjoy for a parking fee of £2 a day. The Deer roam free so dogs must be leashed. There is also an industrial museum and a Basford beam engine that can be seen in steam on the last Sunday of the month, well worth timing your visit for. Smaller than the engine at Papplewick, but great, none the less. The staff are friendly, informative and a bit of a hoot.&lt;br/&gt;There are toilets and good coffee available in the courtyard. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please see http://coord.info/GC2DQ8Z form more infomation.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Copied from my OpenCachingUK log:

The second day of my East Midlands caching trip, and I left the caravan site at Cotgrave fully expecting to hit the morning rush hour on my 12 mile drive here. But my campervan sailed through with no traffic at all - even the threat of long queues due to roadworks failed to materialise, and I pulled into the car park just 15 minutes after leaving the site. Do you not have a rush hour here :-) ?

There were some muggles by the car park cache, so I decided to leave that until the end, and headed here first. With such an open expanse through 180 degrees this could be a tricky one to do stealthily, but at this time of the morning I had the entire place to myself and it was no trouble at all.

Thanks for the cache,

After completing the Outback cache at the South Western side of the park, I continued my walk around to the opposite side to have a look for this one as well. Took a few minutes out to watch the golfing deer, before heading back down to ground zero. Cache was found and logged with perfect time between passing muggles and their barking doggles.

Took: Rasta TB
Left: Alfa TB

Thanks for the cache,

Second puzzle cache on my list to attempt today and having arrived at ground zero, had to wait for ages, before the coast was clear and I could &quot;go for it&quot;. Quickly grabbed this little cache and stuck it in my sky rocket, before heading back into the dry of the cache mobile to do the log signing and rolling up bit. Another wait for a gap in what seemed like a constant stream of muggles today, before nipping back and re-placing it.

Thanks for the cache and a very colourful puzzle,

Having failed to get out and look for caches on my last couple of trips to my home town, I'd built quite a list of solved puzzles that I was determined to have a bash at today. Despite the afternoon pleasure and it being well taters, I ventured out and made my way to the calculated co-ords for this puzzle. Parked at the southern end of the frog and walked over to where the maths was indicating the cache would be. I had a really good rummage around and after coming up empty handed, resorted to taking a butchers at the hint, which although helped me focus my search a little better, was still an area I'd already searched. As a last ditch attempt I took to a more archealogical approach to my hunt! I started digging around with a stick in the ground debris that had built up and much to my delight, found it. Or at least found something attractive that shouldn't have been there! Soon had said item opened up and signed the slightly damp log, before adjusting it slightly and placing it back where I figured it should really have been hanging around if the hint was to be believed.

Thanks for the cache and nice mathematical puzzle,

Jon.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A nano placed near to the band stand in Nottingham's
Arboretum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Nottingham Inclosure Act of 1845 - a visionary
project to create a green network around the growing city, to
provide green spaces for relaxation, contemplation, learning,
exercise and clean air - the Arboretum was the first public park
opened in Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The layout and design was carried out under the supervision of
Samuel Curtis, a botanist and horticultural publicist in 1850 who
had previously been involved with the layout of Victoria Park in
the East End of London in 1842.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main aim of the design for Arboretum Park was to take
advantage of the landscape setting whilst providing an interlinking
network of walkways and socialising areas. As a result over 1010
specimen trees and shrubs were planted along with winding paths and
sweeping lawns. The plantings were laid out in what is known as
'The Natural Order' to provide an educational link to nature
through botanical interpretation. Today, some of the mature trees
and shrubs growing here are living relics of the original
collection such as the Lime Trees which were planted as nursery
trees. There are currently over 800 trees of 65 species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout of the park is relatively unchanged and as a result
the Arboretum is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks
&amp; Gardens maintained by English Heritage and contains 9 Grade
II Listed structures within its layout, providing a key asset to
Nottingham's Victorian Heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key features within the park include the Waverly Street Lodge
and entrance, the lake, the Chinese Bell Tower, the Victorian
Circular Aviary, the newly renovated Victorian Flower Garden,
Dahlia &amp; Formal garden, the North Sherwood Street entrance, the
statue of Feargus O'Connor, the bust of Samuel Morley and the
Bandstand, an important local feature, which was moved from the
castle site in 1881.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arboretum continues to boast one of the premier tree
collections within the County and is one of the few large green
spaces within the city centre. There has been over £1 million
investment since 2002, following a successful Heritage lottery bid.
The Arboretum has been awarded the Green Flag in 2006, 2007 and
2008 and hopes to retain this award in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park opens at 8am on weekdays and 9am at weekends and Bank
holidays, and closes just before it gets dark (for a full listing
of times click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3305&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure you wedge the cache container firmly back in
place.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

On arrival, he said &quot;I'll take this end and you take the other&quot;. As usual, I had the wrong end and B eventually found it on the other side under the stile.

This was one of the 24 finds made today as part of Team KT, a fluid group of cachers who all regularly attend the KT events in Cheshire. We were blessed with a beautiful day's sunshine and the fields were full of pirates as we made our way around the walk. Notable highlights along the way included those wide open golden fields of barley dotted with wild poppies, the fun banter from the ever changing group and all the other people that we met along the way, the muddy bits, the cool breaks in the woods, the curious calves, bored bulls and friendly horses, the variety and challenge of some of the stiles, and of course the wide open panoramic views and did I mention yet how hot and sunny it was today.

34/37 caches today! 

Camping this weekend for Piratemania with Night_witch &amp; El Bloque!
Having failed to complete the loop earlier, due to having to return for the BBQ, El Bloque and I decided it had to be completed, so we headed out for a spot of nightcaching!

A quick find here...a shame it won't be on my main caching stats! :( I think this is my first opencaching only cache!

Thanks! :)</groundspeak:text>

A short walk down from the previous GC cache and we arrived at this one.  Spot on co-ords meant we had the cache to hand within seconds.
Now onwards and upwards to the next cache.

There's a lovely view from the cache site over the Ecclesbourne valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggested parking is on the car park at Hazelwood Memorial Hall (at the coordinates above) - please don't park your car on any of the surrounding roads as you'll cause an obstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the above coordinates you'll find a bench in memory of Councillor R.S.

Now follow your GPS - bingo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can make this into a very short circular walk by continuing along the footpath and over the stile. Follow the footpath down the left edge of the field until you arrive at a track going left (to a gate) immediately before the path goes through the hedge. Walk to the gate to join the road (Hob Hill). Turn left and walk up the road, past Hazelwood Church to the cross roads. Turn left to return to the memorial hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the covering over the cache as found and be careful not to arouse too much suspicion from the people at the nearby houses!</groundspeak:long_description>

Anyway arrived in the village and found a bench for a spot of lunch then I recognised the name on the bench!

Used my mobile to pull the details and as the final was not that far away I decided to take a small detour from my planned route (and completed the advised short walk).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To receive updates on the whole series place this cache
on your watch list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the Tissington Trail can be found
here:http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/hptt/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the Tissington Trail can be found

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the Tissington Trail can be found

&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the Tissington Trail can be found
here:http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/hptt/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is a long distance caching series with
no micros and has been placed with the assistance of the Peak
District National Park Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is part of the first section which travels from
Ashbourne up the popular Tissington Trail for 13miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available along the trail at different locations
meaning that you can complete the series in small chunks if you
prefer. This part of &quot;The Derbyshire Trails&quot; is accessible to all
and during peak times rest points along the track sell food,
hotdrinks and even hire out bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches are designed to be straight forward hides however
certain areas have been avoided on the advice of Peak District
National Park Authority staff. These particular areas are subject
to clearance routines throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tissington Trial can get VERY busy at weekends (especially
when the sun comes out) - please be wary of muggles when hunting or
replacing. Please also make a note of a problems in your log so I
can act quickly to resolve any maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the Tissington Trail can be found
here:http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/hptt/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable, including a logbook, pencil and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The moor has been used for over 4000 years for agriculture, mining, living settlements and as a burial ground. Legend has it that the stone circle was created when 9 ladies and a fiddler were all turned to stone for dancing on the sabbath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache can be done as part of small circular walk, parking at&lt;br/&gt;Birchover quarry car park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DID YOU KNOW... that this cache was used to advertise the latest Garmin eTrex models.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Copied from my OpenCachingUK log:

On my final morning, the best cache of my mini break. Spectacular countryside of the type I like the best, high on the moors. The sun shone from a blue sky, even though this late in the year it wasn't strong enough to burn off the heavy mist that was lying in the valleys. And I had this lovely landscape all to myself.

The cache was tricky to find, even with the hint, and I was pleased finally to place my hand on it.

This cache gets a recommendation point, of course. But it gets more than that. I create unique TOP CACHE geo-coins for presentation to the owners of the best caches I find, and this cache qualifies. It will be 3 months before it is ready, but examples can be seen on http://www.amberel.com/topcache.htm.

Thanks for an excellent cache, and a most enjoyable morning,

Rgds, Andy

The village consists of limestone cottages, enriched by gardens full of colour, many of the occupiers having learned the craft in the gardens at Chatsworth House. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache, located at the top of High Street where it suddenly and surprisingly comes to an end and turns into a rough cart track by the accurately named Top House. The 35mm cartridge is located just within the wooded area off the track.  ** For Parking, please park on High Street, or further down in the village before where the road turns into the cart track **&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the cache links in to the historical past of the village and in particular the point at where at the top of High Street it splits in to three pathways; the one going straight on is of the most historical significance, as this was the route used by packhorses carrying lead from Monyash bound for the North Sea. Pilsley was a stopping point, where fresh animals were substituted for the next section of the journey.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Almost all Pilsley’s population either works on, or used to work on the Chatsworth Estate - or holds a connection with the estate through a partner. The inhabitants have a wide range of skills as they have had the task of maintaining Chatsworth House and Gardens over the last 400 years.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a pull in to park the car and access is via a well trodden path through the broken stone wall about 10 meters east of the lay by. Please note although this is a single track lane it does get busy and cars do speed so please keep pets and children at hand until through the wall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a little different. It is only big enough for the log book and a small pencil, although I would advise taking your own pen/pencil. It’s well hidden and GPS in this area can be a little unreliable (you’ll see why on arrival). Please be careful when retrieving the log book and replacing it. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Comprising of Three lakes &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a small plastic box containing a log book and pen along with a few other items. We placed the cache at Linacre because it is a place I have visited many times thought-out my life and the location holds many memories. I still visit often to jog the 3 miles around the reservoirs. Around the lakes regular information boards inform you about the history of the area. It’s a great place to visit for all the family. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Walked up from Clumber grotto. The dog loved the puddles on the path and got so muddy she needed a bath when we got home.  Nice hide in a great location.  Took a few minutes to find as we were looking to close to the fence.  
Thanks for some great caches today.</groundspeak:text>

Nipped into Clumber Park and parked the Cachemobile in a small turning before venturing out into the darkness to look for this cache. Thankfully there was a small amount of moonlight and with the light from my GPSr screen I managed to search ground zero and locate the cache! Neat hiding place and pleased to say it was found without any bushwhacking required, as I'm my best shirt and suit for a wedding reception. There was a sheet of paper/litter blowing around at ground zero, I'm fairly sure it wasn't from the cache as it seemed to talk about some kind of walking challenge, with participants names and details on it. I hooked it onto a nearby branch to stop it blowing away, maybe if it's still there and hasn't been collected by however lost it, the next cacher could CITO it out?

Thanks for the cache and now I must try and slip back into the party down the road [;)]

You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;GPS Hire - Garmin GPS devices are now available to hire from Longshaw Visitors Centre.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;GPS Hire - Garmin GPS devices are now available to hire from Longshaw Visitors Centre.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;GPS Hire - Garmin GPS devices are now available to hire from Longshaw Visitors Centre.  For more information or for advanced booking please phone 01433 637904.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Too rocky...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C &amp; O, two little girls from Germany who have lived, met and become friends in Sheffield climbed this little mountain, clambered on some rocks and hid a cache to remember their fabulous time and say goodbye - for a while.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A nice steady walk lead me up to the ridge and rocky outcrop.  The cache was found in the first place I looked which I love when that happens as there could have been quite a few other sneaky hides around here.  Well done for the &quot;Cache Du Jour&quot; rating as this is a brilliant cache and location with amazing views all round!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is part of a family friendly trail of 5 caches around the National Trust Longshaw Estate.  You can either complete the entire trail, which will take between 2-4 hours, or do a few at a time.  There is an information sheet, downloadable from http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/geocaching or to collect from the Longshaw Visitors Centre, to take around with you on the trail.  Each cache contains a hole punch to stamp the sheet. Collect all 5 stamps to claim a free cup of tea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in the Peak District are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information about the biodiversity or history of each location and a family-friendly activity to do.  Some of the items in the caches are not swappable and have been included purely because they aid the seeker to complete the activity in the box.  These items are labelled and include a logbook, pencil, crayons, stamp and activity and information cards.  Please do not swap these items.  There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs).     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The public footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather.  Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2.	Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet.  &lt;br/&gt;3.	Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths.  &lt;br/&gt;4.	Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.	Some of the footpaths pass through fields and open moorland, which at some times of the year have livestock in them. Please close all gates behind you and keep dogs on a lead.&lt;br/&gt;6.	For information on available facilities (e.g. cafes, toilets and parking) visit http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/places-to-visit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information:  The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate/difficult slopes and several stiles along some routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books or via this website.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The walk from the parking spot is very easy on a steady canal towpath with excellent views of the Colne Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located just off the canal towpath near to the bridge. You are looking for a smallish clip top box. I have placed the cache in a spot which does not suffer from too much tree coverage so please hide well and place back the stones covering.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We happened to spot this sign while driving along the main road
close to home, and obviously, were intrigued!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we went to investigate, we met &quot;Nature Dave&quot; and all became
clear....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This path was used as access to Crofton pit, now a nature
reserve. Local residents have been using it for years and have now
made a proper, way-marked path. It's a sight to behold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not park on the main road and take care crossing
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH26M2T - GC26M2T Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 53° 39.904 W 001° 27.188&lt;br /&gt;The sign and start of the path</groundspeak:long_description>

A very pleasant walk down to the cache, but once there we couldn't find it. Overanout PAF'd previous finders and the general consensus was the cache hide has been cleared away, no doubt by Nature Dave.
Still worth the walk down just to see the nature trail.

Many thanks to Rutson for confirming the cache was missing and allowing this as a find.</groundspeak:text>

If you're wary of sticking your hand... arm... in deep dark holes, this might not be the cache for you :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please ensure the cache is returned deep within it's hiding place after finding.

Just the log inside so you'll need to bring a pen.

The moor is very popular with walkers, dog walkers, mountain bikers and Sunday strollers, so please take care when locating and replacing. Stealthy head required :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small clip-top box with some goodies, logbook (in a tube) and pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace correctly and hide completely. Thanks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are plenty of other caches and Munzee's in the area for you to find. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Farnhill Moor is a lovely place for a meander around the various paths that criss-cross it. Farnhill Pinnacle (Jubilee Tower) is known to my kids as &quot;The Giants Ice Cream&quot;. Apparently the giant dropped his ice cream as this is the remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is in a rocky corner of the area and small kids will need supervising. You are looking for a small food pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please make sure you replace the pot as far back in the hide as possible along with the hiding stone. Lots of caches go missing up here due to the popularity with muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are plenty of other caches and Munzee's to find on the moor.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache has been placed in a fantastic area of the Yorkshire Dales. Some might consider the cache location dangerous; an old disused mine, so please be prepared for dark enclosed places if you consider attempting to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;But... this mine entrance is used by hundreds of cavers every year as it is a main access and exit for one of the many cave systems in the area. It is on the main Public Footpath through the area so is also explored by walkers and families such as mine. It is an exciting place to visit as long as you take sensible precautions. So as well as the usual walking paraphernalia you WILL need a torch and be very careful of your head. Gloves and helmet are advised. My 10yr old loves this place and we collect many crystals on each visit... hence the cache name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache coordinates place you at the mine entrance. The following instructions will take you to the cache. I have provided plenty of photographs that will also help you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Check: Torch, gloves, helmet, HEAD!&lt;br/&gt;2. Enter the mine. DUCK!&lt;br/&gt;3. Continue carefully down the mine until you see a large opening on your left.&lt;br/&gt;4. Climb up to the opening and down the other side. MIND YOUR FOOTING!&lt;br/&gt;5. On your right should be an old abseil rope hanging and some foot &amp; hand holds to the cave at the top. DON'T USE THESE! :o&lt;br/&gt;6. Further down on your right you will see a large, but low cave opening. Carefully scramble down. MIND YOUR HEAD!&lt;br/&gt;7. The cache in under the half-buried mine trolley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available at N 54 3.486  W 001 54.052&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take as much care over finding &amp; replacing the cache as I have in setting it up. Replace the cache in the same spot along with any geo-stones or other hiding materials... Thanx :)&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Brimham Rocks is owned and managed by the National Trust.  Naturally formed over 320 million years this amazing collection of weird and wonderful millstone grit rock formations makes a great day out for families, climbers and those wanting to enjoy the simple pleasures of fresh air and magnificent views over Nidderdale.  Let your imagination run wild as you explore the labyrinth of paths through this unique landscape and keep an eye out for some fantastically shaped rocks.   Spot the Dancing Bear, The Eagle and The Gorilla, crawl through The Smartie Tube and balance on the Rocking Stones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walk from the main car park to this cache takes you out of the main, busy rocks area and onto the heather moorland.  The Countryside Team, made up of staff and volunteers, have done much work over the past few years to maintain the heather.  Brimham moor is being home to three local varieties of heather: ling heather, bell heather, and cross-leaved heath. Bracken, with its rapid growth and extended root system, shades out the heather and other species such as bilberry.  If left unattended it would take over the moor and the heather would be lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Countryside Team use different bracken control techniques. A recent Higher Level Stewardship grant has made all the difference to the team’s ultimate success or failure in bracken control, as it has made possible the purchase of the necessary equipment. A selective herbicide is used, which thoroughly eradicates bracken at its root, resulting in seven to eight years of managed countryside.  It is hoped that in this time the heather, bilberry and other moorland plants can re-establish, creating a mature moorland and making it more difficult for the bracken to come back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small rocky outcrop where the cache is located can be seen from all approaches, with the mushroom perched on top.  Access is via footpaths which are uneven in places and can be muddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be found at N 54° 04.586 W 001° 40.955.  Parking is free to National Trust members, non-members pay and display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

When the railways ran to Pateley Bridge people would take a horse drawn coach to Brimham and, by 1862, they would pay sixpence for a tour of the rocks and Refreshments at Brimham House.  In order to earn extra tips tour guides would make up elaborate and whimsical tales of how the rocks were formed – the better the story the bigger the tip!

In teh 18th and 19th centuries people visited Brimham and believed that the rocks had been man-made and were carved by hand thousands of years ago.  In fact the rocks have been formed by entirely natural processes, starting over 320 million years ago when a vast range of mountains, as big as the Himalayas lay to the north.  These were thrown up as continents collided.  Mighty rivers washed loose sand, grit and pebbles down from these mountains and flowed into a delta covering half of Yorkshire.  As the water slowed down in the delta the grit and mud settled in the river bed.  Over millennia these layers compressed and formed the Millstone Grit which Brimham is famous for.  During the Ice Age a passing glacier created the Nidderdale valley, but the hard Millstone Grit resisted this erosion and was left exposed as the softer rock was cut away.  The rocks were then further sand blasted by wind, rain and frost into the shapes we see today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access is via footpaths which are uneven in places and can be muddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be found at N 54° 04.586 W 001° 40.955.  Parking is free to National Trust members, non-members pay and display.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Brimham Rocks is owned and managed by the National Trust.  Naturally formed over 320 million years this amazing collection of weird and wonderful millstone grit rock formations makes a great day out for families, climbers and those wanting to enjoy the simple pleasures of fresh air and magnificent views over Nidderdale.  Let your imagination run wild as you explore the labyrinth of paths through this unique landscape and keep an eye out for some fantastically shaped rocks.   Spot the Dancing Bear, The Eagle and The Gorilla, crawl through The Smartie Tube and balance on the Rocking Stones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walk from the main car park to this cache takes you out of the main, busy rocks area and onto the heather moorland.  The Countryside Team, made up of staff and volunteers, have done much work over the past few years to maintain the heather.  Brimham moor is being home to three local varieties of heather: ling heather, bell heather, and cross-leaved heath. Bracken, with its rapid growth and extended root system, shades out the heather and other species such as bilberry.  If left unattended it would take over the moor and the heather would be lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Countryside Team use different bracken control techniques. A recent Higher Level Stewardship grant has made all the difference to the team’s ultimate success or failure in bracken control, as it has made possible the purchase of the necessary equipment. A selective herbicide is used, which thoroughly eradicates bracken at its root, resulting in seven to eight years of managed countryside.  It is hoped that in this time the heather, bilberry and other moorland plants can re-establish, creating a mature moorland and making it more difficult for the bracken to come back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small rocky outcrop where the cache is located can be seen from all approaches, with the mushroom perched on top.  Access is via footpaths which are uneven in places and can be muddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be found at N 54° 04.586 W 001° 40.955.  Parking is free to National Trust members, non-members pay and display.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I understand that the NT is trying to make people aware of geocaching but this is poor. The cache is impossible to get without being seen from the path. They have no idea what discrete means and how we look for these caches as a challenges. If everyone gets to know where they are, things will go missing. This was just a plastic tub full of rubbish, shame on you for not hiding with a bit more flair and not in a place in full public view.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mackershaw Deer Park is a lovely area of the Fountains Abbey Estate situated just outside of the pay-for-entry barrier. Walking through Mackershaw allows for brilliant views of the Deer Park and surrounding areas.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden at the entrance to Mackershaw and is a relatively easy find. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that Mackershaw remains a part of the Fountains Abbey Deer Park and as such the field is populated with both cattle and deer (bulls are often in the next door field). Stags rut between Mid September and October and visitors should be extra cautious during this time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fawning season is between June and August, during which time visitors are asked to be especially mindful of the deer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogs on short leads are welcome throughout the Estate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this the privately-owned shoot situated on the Fountains Estate has the right to shoot on the Estate on Fridays between November-February. The Deer Park remains open for visitors during this time, however visitors should be aware of this and remain cautious of the shoot.   </groundspeak:long_description>

The find certainly 'made our day' until we realised that it wasn't part of the caches on www.geocaching.com and therefore, we couldn't add it to our tally of finds.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hi there..
Could the owner of the cache please contact me.
It would seem that Opencache units have been placed very close to Geocaches that have been given permission by the NT.
Would just like some verification with the cache owner ;*)
Contact me at Madyokel@Bolam.Org

Cheers

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This National Trust multicache will take you on a short hike
around Scarth Wood Moor - a beautiful part of the North York Moors
National Park and a great spot for wildlife too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views from the top of the moor are fantastic. In spring
displaying snipe are a common sight and cuckoos can often be seen
too. In summer the moors turn purple as the heather flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates given are not for the cache itself, but for the
suggested parking. The area can get busy in the summer and if the
car park is full it is recommended to wait for a space. The road is
a clearway and parking on the roadside is illegal. The police
regularly visit to issue tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the cache you will have to answer the following
questions. For each of them you will need to convert letter into
numbers. (ie a=1, b=2, c=3, etc):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qustion One - N 54° 23.204 W 001° 16.893&lt;br /&gt;
There are twelve letters carved into the stone. Add together the
2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54° 23.494 W 001° 17.379&lt;br /&gt;
There is a single letter carved into a stone here. What number
represents this letter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54° 23.542 W 001° 17.495&lt;br /&gt;
Time to admire the view and have a bit of a rest after the climb to
the top of the hill. The bench here commemorates Eleanor Mary
Lawson. What are the last two digits of the year of her birth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the cache is N 54° 23.??? W 001° 17.0??&lt;br /&gt;
The last three digits of the northing are your answer to question
two + (10 x your answer to question one).&lt;br /&gt;
The last two digits of the easting are given by your answer to
question three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is extremely popular with visitors so stealth will be
required at all times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There is car parking right next to the first question and the rest of the walk is off road and should take less than an hour. The cache is also listed on geocaching.com where it has been completed many times without any problems.</groundspeak:text>

To the 1st clue maybe, our GPS took us on a 40 minute walk, along quite a busy stretch of road for the 1st (with no pavement) 20 minutes or so, to the 2nd clue, which we couldn't find.  While the kids were still looking I loaded the next co'ordinates into the GPS and found a 10 mile walk....  We decided then to give up, there was a public footpath signposted, though this wasn't signposted at the beginning of or 40 minute walk, which turned from a walk through a field to an almost dangerous clamber down a rocky hillside.  We have found caches before with this level of difficulty and terrain, always with the family, including a 3yr old, and never had any problems.  We were disappointed that this one went so wrong.  We won't be doing another multi in a hurry.</groundspeak:text>

mission around Cliff Ridge Wood and Cliff Rigg Quarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peace and tranquillity that can be enjoyed in Cliff Ridge
Wood and Quarry is a stark contrast to how the area would have been
towards the end of the 19th century. At this time the quarry was in
full swing with large quantities of whinstone being removed and
transported away by tram, the remains of which can still be seen in
the wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whinstone itself was formed around 58 million years ago when
volcanic activity caused hot molten rock to be injected through the
sedimentary bedrock. Over the millennia this weathered more slowly
than the surrounding rock causing ridges to be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find out more about both the formation of the ridge and
the history of the quarry reading the information panels that
provide the fact you will need to complete this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

mission around Roseberry Topping – Cleveland’s most
famous natural landmark.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This distinctive shaped hill has a long history of providing
inspiration to those who visit it. When the Vikings invaded and
came to the area they believed that the hill was sacred and
dedicated it to their god Odin. The modern name of Roseberry is in
fact a corruption of the Norse name Odin’s Berg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a boy, the famous explorer Captain James Cook lived with his
family at Airey Holme Farm, which can be seen to the south of the
summit. When he had time off from working as a farm hand, the young
James is said to have got his first taste of exploration and
adventure by climbing to the top of Roseberry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other fascinating facts and stories associated
with Roseberry Topping many of which you’ll discover in
completing this multicache. The final cache contains ‘The
Terrible Tale of Prince Oswy’ – the hill’s most
horrifying legend. Be sure to read it before you sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question One: N 54°30.174' W 001°06.601'&lt;br /&gt;
Despite what is says on the plate there is considerable
disagreement about when and by whom this folly was built.
It’s also more likely that it was intended to be a summer
house where Victorian visitors could rest before continuing the
climb to the summit, than a shooting box. At least we can be
certain of the year in which it was restored. When was this?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = 19AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54°30.325' W 001°06.438'&lt;br /&gt;
Triangulations pillars were erected by the Ordnance Survey from
1935 on prominent hills across Great Britain. On a clear day it was
possible to see at least two other triangulation pillars at every
point. By carefully measuring the angles between each pillar the
Ordnance Survey were able to accurately map the whole of the
country. Every triangulation pillar has a unique reference number.
What is the number of this pillar?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = S4CDE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54°30.349' W 001°06.281'&lt;br /&gt;
The Cleveland Way is a long distance footpath that runs from
Helmsley to Filey and visits Roseberry Topping. How far would you
have to walk from here to reach Filey?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = FG&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Sounds like you were nearly there. You just need to do some simple maths to get the last three didgets of the latitude and longitude. As the listing says, the final cache is at The final cache is at: N 54 32.(G-J)(D-A)(I-E) W 001 02.(K-F)(C)(B-H).

So, if you had the answers A=1, D=7, E=3, G=9, I=8 and J= 6 the latitude would be;

N 54 32.(9-6)(7-1)(8-3) = N 54 32.385

The final is a short walk from question 6. The cache has been found by many people on geocaching.com so if you've got your answers right you'll definitely head to the right spot.</groundspeak:text>

The main reason for this being that we had far to many numbers at the end of the quiz and weren't sure which ones to load into the GPS.  We tried minusing some, G - J, D -A etc but that didn't work, can the hider help us out with this please???</groundspeak:text>

Ormesby Hall consists of two houses, the Old Wing built in the early 1600s and the Georgian mansion built in the 1740s. The Hall is surrounded by a lovely landscaped estate, some of which is farmland. Also on the estate is the 18thC Stables, now the home of the Cleveland Police Mounted Section, and Grange Farm which was the home farm for the Hall and is now a private tenanted farm. &lt;br/&gt;Since the last owner owner of Ormesby Hall, Lt.Col. James Pennyman died in 1961, Ormesby Hall has been in the hands of the National Trust, a major charity who look after historic buildings and areas of countryside ‘For Ever, For Everyone’.

You run the risk of being locked in at closing time if you use the estate car park. &lt;br/&gt;The gardens at the back of Ormesby Hall were the setting for many theatrical and musical performances produced by Mrs Ruth Pennyman. The most notable were Shakespeare’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’, ‘Romeo and Juliet’ and ‘Henry V’ put on to raise funds to build the Village Hall in 1937.

Ormesby Hall consists of two houses, the Old Wing built in the early 1600s and the Georgian mansion built in the 1740s. The Hall is surrounded by a lovely landscaped estate, some of which is farmland. Also on the estate is the 18thC Stables, now the home of the Cleveland Police Mounted Section, and Grange Farm which was the home farm for the Hall and is now a private tenanted farm. &lt;br/&gt;Since the last owner owner of Ormesby Hall, Lt.Col. James Pennyman died in 1961, Ormesby Hall has been in the hands of the National Trust, a major charity who look after historic buildings and areas of countryside ‘For Ever, For Everyone’. The Trust is not only responsible for the conservation of heritage and environment but also for making visitors welcome. We hope you enjoy your time here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ormesby Hall #2		HOME FOR HORSES &lt;br/&gt;Park off the estate on Church Lane unless the Hall is open to the public. You run the risk of being locked in at closing time if you use the estate car park. &lt;br/&gt;The Stable Block was built in 1779 by the infamous ‘Wicked’ Sir James Pennyman who used the Hall as his summer residence, entertaining his London friends, going to local race courses and betting on the horses. He managed to bankrupt himself through gambling and high living. These magnificent Stables now house horses of the Cleveland Police Mounted Section who regularly patrol at Middlesbrough Football Club matches.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK34WV5 - GC34WV5 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 54° 32.755 W 001° 10.885</groundspeak:long_description>

There is limited street-side parking in the area, you won't be able to see or grab this from your car, but it should be an easy, disabled friendly cache and grab for anyone who happens to be in the area. Plenty of people walk and drive along here all the time, so please be a little careful when caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache contains log book &amp; pencil. Please put it back carefully and out of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middlesbrough played their last season here in 1995 before moving to the Riverside Stadium which also has it's own cache - Riverside Roar (GC1CAQB). The street names and the layout of the roads give good clues as to where everything used to be (the street &quot;The Turnstiles&quot; leads to &quot;The Midfield&quot;). There's nothing to see here now, it's just housing. For those that like their football memories if you do the nearby Dorman Museum cache (GC14KJQ) then to your left you can see a statue of Brian Clough walking to Ayresome Park in the local park, well worth a closer look. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The Durham Coast has recovered from its industrial past to
become one of the finest stretches of coastline in the country. The
Magnesian Limestone that underlies the area gives rise to
spectacular displays of rare wild-flowers in the summer while the
steep sided denes that cut through the cliff are sheltered havens
for all sorts of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the 19th century there were a number of
significant ship wrecks in the area as trade in coal and industrial
goods between Newcastle and London increased. One of the measure
introduced to prevent such disaster was the building of a
coastguard station at Hawthorn Dene. This cache can be found close
to the remains of the building.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A real hidden gem! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you make a note of the numbers written both on the lid and the logbook of each of the four caches as you will need them to find the bonus cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raintonpark Wood has fantastic wildlife and is a really peaceful place to spend a few hours, especially by the river Wear.

Have previously visited it with Cubs and Scouts from my own group, 1st Framwellgate Moor Scout Group (www.framscouts.org.uk). We have left necker badges from both our groups in the cache. This particular cache you wouldn't want to try and access if the river had broken its banks so keep a close eye on the river as you go down the steps. Luckily the times I have been it has never been too high but I have a feeling it could potentially get there. Also take care on the steps as they are steep and have quite a drop to the side though it is perfectly safe as long as care is taken. (I've taken two lots of Cubs down them without any issues.)</groundspeak:text>

A real hidden gem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole of Mallygill Wood is designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument for its coal mining remains. During the 14th century coal had become a valuable commodity and at Mallygill Wood the coal naturally occurred near the surface. Monks from Finchale Abbey are believed to have mined the coal here. They dug down into the seam and then along to collect more coal, creating bell shaped pits. You can still see where these bell pit were today. Just look out for the hollows that can be found throughout the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mallygill wood is also a fantastic place for wildlife with plenty of woodland flowers on display in early spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please help us keep Mallygill Wood special by sticking to the footpath until you are close to the cache and not trampling the vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK30MMG - GC30MMG Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 54° 48.840 W 001° 31.048</groundspeak:long_description>

Trust along the part of the Durham Coast that we care for, so if
you enjoy this one please check out the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Durham Coast has recovered from its industrial past to
become one of the finest stretches of coastline in the country. The
Magnesian Limestone that underlies the area gives rise to
spectacular displays of rare wild-flowers in the summer while the
steep sided denes that cut through the cliff are sheltered havens
for all sorts of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawthorn Towers was a Gothic-style 30 room mansion built around
1810 by Major George Anderson of Newcastle. It was bought by the
Pemberton family in the 1850s. In the 1930s it was rented by the
Boys' Brigade for weekend camps then during WW2 it was used by the
military and the Home Guard. The Pemberton family sold it in the
late 1940s and it had several owners before being demolished in
1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it is hard to believe there was ever a big mansion house
here. There are a few clues however, including the fruit trees and
bushes that grown in a patch of trees that used to be the orchard.
You can find this cache among them.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This series of caches will take you on a circular walk around Raintonpark Wood - one of the National Trust’s less well known properties in County Durham. A real hidden gem! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you make a note of the numbers written both on the lid and the logbook of each of the four caches as you will need them to find the bonus cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raintonpark Wood has fantastic wildlife and is a really peaceful place to spend a few hours, especially by the river Wear. It has some interesting historical features too. Look out for the cobbled stream. It was built by monks to transport coal mined in nearby Mallygill Wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone. Please help us keep Raintonpark Wood special by sticking to the circular path that will take you close to all the caches and by avoiding trampling vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK30VPD - GC30VPD Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 54° 48.840 W 001° 31.048</groundspeak:long_description>

The park dates back to the 1930's and is one of the main attractions in the town and is a 'gateway site' to the Great North Forest. The River Wear runs along the East of the park and it's next to the Durham County Cricket ground. This used to be the main entrance to the park before the pedestrian footbridge was built. This is a nano so bring a pen, also if the log hasn't been replaced properly it can be tricky to extract so come prepared! You can access the cache either from the park or as a drive by from the A167 dual carriageway where there is a small space for one car to pull in. There is a pay and display car park in the park itself.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This multicache will take you on a fact finding trail around
Penshaw Hill in order to reveal the final location of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Penshaw Monument was built in 1844 in honour of John George
Lambton, first Earl of Durham and the first Governor of the
Province of Canada. The design is based on the Temple of
Hephaestus, a Greek temple in Athens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penshaw Hill is also the setting for part of the story of the
Lambton Worm. This mythical dragon is said to have terrorised the
area and grew so large that it could wrap its tail ten times around
the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the National Trust care for the monument and the hill
itself making it a great place for both visitors and wildlife. The
National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car parking is available below Penshaw Hill at N 54°52.926' W
001°28.716'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question One: N 54°52.896' W 001°28.736'&lt;br /&gt;
The interpretation panel shows the various visitor attractions in
the area. How many National Trust sites are marked?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54°52.912' W 001°28.736'&lt;br /&gt;
Take some the time to read all about the wildlife and history of
Penshaw Hill. Find out what year the west side of the monument was
rebuilt.&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = 19&lt;b&gt;BC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54°52.981' W 001°28.858'&lt;br /&gt;
The placard on the monument was put in place when it was donated to
the National Trust in 1939. It includes further information on John
George Lambton, including the date of his death. When was
this?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;DE&lt;/b&gt; July 1840&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Four: N 54°52.981' W 001°28.877'&lt;br /&gt;
Triangulations pillars were erected by the Ordnance Survey from
1935 on prominent hills across Great Britain. On a clear day it was
possible to see at least two other triangulation pillars at every
point. By carefully measuring the angles between each pillar the
Ordnance Survey were able to accurately map the whole of the
country. Every triangulation pillar has a unique reference number.
What is the number of this pillar?&lt;br /&gt;
Answer = S&lt;b&gt;FGHI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal: N 54
5(&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;+&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;).(&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;)
W 001
2(&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;).(&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is extremely popular with visitors so stealth will be
required at all times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache at the site of Penshaw Monument (formally the Earl of Durham Monument). Description&lt;br/&gt;Penshaw Monument is a Doric tetrastyle monument and is a half size replica of The Temple of Hephaestus in Athens. Construction was started on the site in 1844 and in 1939 the 5th Earl of Durham donated the monument and the surrounding hill to the National Trust. Penshaw Monument is one of the best known landmarks in the North East of England being easily visible from both the A1(M) motorway and A19 on approching the area from the south. A climb up the hill offers commanding views of the area. The cache is not located within the monument itself, but very near by. The terrain has been given a mark of 3 as, while not particularly difficult, the final climb up to the top of the hill is quite steep but should be manageable by any able bodied person. Thank you to the National Trust who kindly gave their permission to site the cache here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Our 'new' brick HQ - replacing the orginal wooden hut was built in 1967. 1st Washington Scouts provide adventure and activity for young people aged 6-18 in the local area. The cache was hidden by the Explorer Scout Unit who meet at the HQ on a Wednesday night. It is an old pepper pot to kick things off we have put a badge, paperclip and Peseta. We'd love it if the Peseta could find its way back to Spain and you could upload a picture of you holding the badge.</groundspeak:long_description>

Gibside is also a haven for wildlife with red kites often circling in the skies above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a 2.6L clip &amp; close plastic container – cleverly camouflaged, we hope!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first attempt at an OpenCaching cache (I have coming up to 200 finds on the other site) unfortunately this was unsuccessful. 

Got to GZ and there was lots of potential hiding places but no sign of a cache. I didn't want to rip the place apart too much, this is National Trust property after all. 

There being no hint didn't help - it's very unusual for a cache not to have a hint 

If someone could confirm that the cache is still in situ and perhaps if the owner supplied a hint (for this and the other Gibside caches) then I shall return!

pS Enjoyed our day at Gibside anyway especially the history tour we were given by the guide.</groundspeak:text>

This was our 3rd find at Gibside.  Disappointing box, we thought people might not have taken it seriously, swaps weren't great - a carrier bag?????  We took a leaflet for Beamish Wild and replaced it with a dice rubber.
Didn't do the activity as another family appeared that we thought might also be geocachers :/</groundspeak:text>

Our 1st official find as geocaches, well done Brand.
Great box, lots of things to swap, we took a bug finding kit and replaced it with a funky pen.
Tree activity was interesting, kids all got involved, same with searching for paw prints.</groundspeak:text>

We’ve started off the stash with lots of fun goodies to be swapped – please write your swap down in the logbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be aware that the caches are accessible during the regular published opening hours only (normally 10am – 6pm but please visit www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gibside to check up to date details). Access to the estate is free to all National Trust members, an admission fee is payable for non-members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the paths around Gibside have steep slopes and may be slippery in wet weather. Please take care as you explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional waypoints:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carpark: N54 55.152 W1 44.049&lt;br/&gt;Visitor reception: N54 55.150 W1 44.019&lt;br/&gt;Stables Learning and Discovery Centre (toilets &amp; tearoom): N54 55.394 W1 43.361 </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Whitburn Lime Kilns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE PARK IN NEAR BY CAR PARKS AND PLEASE CROSS THIS BUSY ROAD SENSIBLY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out there are lots of Muggle cars passing here all the time. Stealth is required to get this one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all, many thanks to The National Trust for giving their permission for me to place this cache at the kilns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whitburn Lime Kilns&lt;br/&gt;The remains of the limekilns that are, perhaps the most visible reminder of this area's industrial past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limestone has been quarried at Marsden for many years. The stone was used in some notable local buildings, including Whitburn windmill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These limekilns were built in the 1870s, taking advantage of Whitburn colliery which provided fuel for burning the limestone to make quick or unslaked lime (calcium oxide). Quicklime was used to neutralise soil, and to make cement and concrete. It was also important for the steel and chemical industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can still see two types of limekilns here. The older ones are in the square shaped building, and the later ones are circular. The bands around the circular kilns are made of iron and were designed to reinforce the structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kilns were essentially large ovens. Layers of limestone and coal were poured in the top and burnt slowly. The resulting quicklime would be extracted at the bottom and loaded onto railway wagons. This was almost a continuous process, with more limestone and coal being added at the top, as quicklime was taken out at the bottom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rail line brought in coal to fire the kilns from Whitburn Colliery. The line continued to the docks at South Shields on which was transported the quicklime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is comouflaged but not too difficult to find. Cache contains a log and pencil, no room for anything else.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was first established in 1952 The site iteslf is located near Stirlinghill and part of it can be seen from the A90 as there is a large white dome (golf ball). This housed several radar systems. Its staff had several living quarters in the area one of them being Pusey Place in Peterhead. In November 2004 the manned operations on the site stopped and the domestic dwellings were sold in 2005. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a very small white plastic tube located on Pusey Place, Peterhead. The cache contains a small log only. Please bring along a pen or pencil for this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its urban location it is a cash and dash and it will not offer any swaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
