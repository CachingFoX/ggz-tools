Les recomiendo que se aseguren que no hay gente en la banca, ni alrededor, cerca hay un supermercado Pomona.

Por favor dejen el cache donde lo encontraron y lo mas probable es que el log book este lleno, asi que lleven un pedazo de papel pequeño.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is nano cache hidden in a interesting spot. I ran across this area while exploring and thought placing a cache here would be fun.

If been researching the area and have only been able to find some limited information. There was another cache near here called Duke's Trestle. While I don't think that was the proper name of the crossing, I do know that this trestle was here for the Barnegat Branch Railroad, which was part of the Toms River Railroad. Trains from Toms River would cross Ceder Creek via the trestle on the way to the Forked River/Lacey Station and destinations further down the Barnegat Branch

As you look across the river, you can see The Barnegat Branch Trail. Hopefully, at some point in the near future the link through Lacey Township will join the north part with complete section in the south. &quot;It is the County’s vision that the BBT will be more than a recreational park; rather, when complete, it will be a vital transportation corridor, as well as a valuable environmental and historical resource and an enormous asset to Ocean County residents and visitors alike&quot;.

History of the Railroad

The Toms River Railroad was established in 1866 with a stop at the county seat of Toms River and extended to Waretown in 1872 by the Toms River and Waretown RR Co. The Central Railroad of New Jersey purchased the line in 1881 and in 1893 the property was transferred to the Toms River &amp; Barnegat RR Co. In the mid-1950s passenger service ended, and freight service continued through the early 1970s. There are many artifact still around along the line, including the round table and coal dump in Barnegat, and the Toms River Freight Station.

Accessing the Cache

This cache is not hidden in, around, above or under the trestle; which is clearly marked to discourage such shenanigans. But, I do encourage you to take and post pictures, and add any history regarding the area. Approach from the South, unless you want to make this a 5 star cache. Parking is available within 100ft of the cache, but some driving in sugar sand and water filled ditches might be in the way, so know the limits of your vehicle. You can always park at the ball fields in William Hebrew Park and walk it.</groundspeak:long_description>

I did not feel safe being there with my son. I would ask that you go check on it and make sure someone did not mess with it. Again we had no luck finding it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;
A 'pile of rocks' is known by a few different names.  Cairn is the most common term ... but it could also be referred to as a 'trail duck' ... or in some interactive instances where you add your own rock to the pile it's a ritual known as 'isivivane'.  Cairns are generally used as a marker of some type.  In some cases they may represent some historical/memorial commemoration ... or they might just provide some decorative/artistic value.

&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;
This 'Pile of Rocks' is alongside the Pine Hill trail in Shark River Park (rock pile is at: 40 11.727N  074 05.452W;  cache container is at coordinates listed above for this cache).  

It's a collection of about 15 to 20 varied sized rocks that are roughly 2 to 5 pounds each (between a few inches to 10 inches wide).  It's not clear who originally placed the rocks there but their form often changes over time via the constructive and destructive actions of hikers on this trail.  

The trees in these woods are of varied age and in some cases could date as old as hundred years ... but a rock ... and possibly even these rocks that make up this cairn ... are likely much older ... maybe even thousands of years old.  

Each time I hike this trail I look forward to coming to this point to see what shape the cairn is in.  Sometimes it's still the way I last constructed it ... other times it's completely knocked down w/ the rocks strewn about.  At first I'm disappointed when I see the cairn knocked down ... and then I realize this allows me the opportunity to pile them back up again.  Once in a while it's (piled up) form is the result of someone else's creative input.  Either way it provides something of interest for each visit on the trail.  

Recently I have been bringing a new rock to the cairn each time I hike the trail ... and add it to the collection of existing rocks.

When you visit this 'Pile of Rocks' you can either just come to see what other's have done (including those that 'destroy') ... or ideally you can be a 'creator/contributor' to the cairn by either bringing a rock of your own (isivivane) ... or just pile the rocks back up if they've been knocked down.  Plan on taking a picture of your creation if you're going to be a 'creator'.

The hidden cache is nearby the cairn about 100 feet south (up the hill) behind the formation and just off the faint trail leading up the hill (this faint trail is not the main trail).  It's hidden under a typical geocaching 'pile of sticks'.  

Come search for the cache and stop to reflect on this 'Pile of Rocks' in the woods along the way.  Add your own little piece of creativity if you're so inclined.

Check out some of the links below to see what others have to say about piling up rocks in unique and unusual ways.

&lt;b&gt;Best Approach:&lt;/b&gt;
Park either in the Gulley Rd. parking lot on Southeastern side of park ... or in the Schoolhouse Rd. parking lot in Northwestern side of park.  Take the Hidden Creek trail (blue trail) and head towards the Pine Hills trail loop in Southwestern corner of park.  The 'rock pile' and cache are just about exactly halfway around the (pine hill trail) loop at the edge of the park's southern boundry.  Trail maps on available at both trailheads mentioned ... both displayed on the board ... and copies for you to take with you.

rapid pace of New Jersey Development.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No bushwhacking required!
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache sits atop a small hill in Neptune City, NJ. This very
hill was home to the Umani and Wanami clan of the Lenni Lenape
tribe of the Algonquins. When the Dutch first started to settle the
land the natives living here referred to themselves as the Newasons
or Navasinks and their land of Neptune City as Nolletquesset. The
sandy soil wasn't very good for farming but the Shark River
provided a seemingly endless supply of fish, clams &amp; crabs to
hungry natives &amp; Europeans alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the English took control of the area &amp; this small
hill became part of Monmouth County, East New Jersey. Through the
years it was part of Shrewsbury, Ocean &amp; finally Neptune
township. Throughout most of the 1800s it was referred to as
Neptune Village until October 4th 1881 when this land was
officially incorporated as Neptune City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1851 there were only seven families living within
the borders of what would eventually become Neptune City (shown on
the map at the left). Though the roads were unlabeled they line up
well with Old Corlies (33), West Sylvania Ave, Rt 18 &amp; Rt 35.
Goose Pond is now Fletcher Lake &amp; Duck Creek is Sylvan Lake.
The black squares on the map indicate households. This quaint
little hill falls very near the third square from the left. It was
owned by &quot;S. Bennett&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land stayed in the family when most of Neptune City was
purchased in 1861 by Henry Bennett who went on to become one of New
Jersey's first Millionaires. Henry Bennett built grand hotels,
horse farms &amp; the Bijou chain of theaters, but left this small
hill untouched as a gift to his family name. It has (narrowly)
avoided destruction/development over the years &amp; today is
hidden &amp; forgotten by all save those who carry the Palmer &amp;
Bennett names. Stand atop the knoll &amp; imagine you are one of
the native Algonquins watching the Dutch &amp; English tall-ships
sail into the Shark River inlet. Jump forward two hundred years
&amp; see yourself as the one of the Bennett children remembering
Samuel, your father, who cleared the land on which you now
stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not attempt to bushwhack to this cache! Most of the
surrounding land is private property &amp; blanketed with thorns.
To visit Bennett's Hill, you should park in the new parking lot by
the Shore Medical building which can be easily accessed via Rt. 33
at the intersection of Oxford Way. There's a traffic light at this
intersection for ease of caching. The NJ Transit 836 also stops at
this corner. No fence/wall climbing or bushwhacking is necessary to
get to GZ, but the area can be dangerous thanks to the
over-aggressive development. You don't even have to leave the
clearing to find the cache. When you find it please be gentle with
the natural camo. Thanks &amp; happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

get to.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend:&lt;/b&gt; Many years ago, the Shaman of the tribe of
native Lenni Lenape had a vision. He spoke of this vision with the
tribe's Chief telling him that they must build a mound and from
this mound they will see the fate of their tribe. The Chief
gathered his people and told them of the Shaman's vision then took
up a handful of earth and carried it to the Shark River valley
where the tribe would have their ceremonies. The tribe members
followed and, one bowl full of dirt at a time, they began to create
the ceremonial mound. It took many years but the mound eventually
became a hill. It is said that from the top the Chief could hear
all of his people and see all of their lands. One day during their
morning ceremony, a young squaw looked out to the East and saw tall
ships docked along the coast. The asked the Shaman what it might
mean but the old man wasn't looking - he was listening. Then they
could all hear it - approaching hoof beats. Men were coming on
horseback, drawn by smoke from the tribe's fire. The Chief turned
to the Shaman to ask what they should do but he was not there.
Where he stood they saw a few butterflies fluttering in the wind,
being blown to the West. It was then that the tribe knew their
fate. To this day you can stand up on the hill and listen to the
&quot;hoof beats&quot; of modern man though the hill has been much eroded by
time and horsepower. While the Lenni Lanape are long gone, you will
find that the butterflies remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache:&lt;/b&gt; You are hunting
for a small round lock-n-lock camouflaged to blend in. You will
want to approach the cache from Campus Parkway near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2a3df2be-70f1-4876-aaed-66cd738f6cfe&quot;&gt;the Gateway cache&lt;/a&gt; and follow the road until it
becomes a trail. At that point, you're on your own. Only minimal
bushwhacking required. Downhill leads to the source springs of the
Shark River. Uphill leads to a smiley! Check the trail map for
details. 
Hunting is no longer allowed here but just in case you might want
to wear your orange in the Fall. This is a special place that gets
little respect from the few who visit. Practice CITO when necessary
and enjoy the hike!&lt;/p&gt;

world-wide for his art. Though quite capable of more &quot;serious&quot;
pieces (he won several awards), he's best known for his nearly
full-scale dinosaurs made from automotive scrap metal. Once, when
asked &quot;Why dinosaurs?&quot; Jim Gary replied, &quot;Because people like
them.&quot; And we do. They spawned a traveling exhibit: &quot;Dinosaurs of
the Twentieth Century&quot; that spent three decades roaming the earth
and breaking attendance records wherever they went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What:&lt;/b&gt; This specific &quot;Garysaurus&quot; is a nearly life-sized
Stegosaurus painted a vibrant green and still decorated with the
Christmas lights that Jim draped around it. Anatomically, it is
very close to accurate. Is it realistic or abstract based on his
choice of medium and colors? This distinction, for which Jim Gary
was unique, made him unclassifiable in artistic circles. The cache
itself is easily classified: Magnetic micro. However it is NOT
located anywhere on the sculpture or newspaper boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; His dinosaur sculptures are getting harder to find
&quot;in the wild&quot; like this and many are only displayed seasonally.
This excellent example of his art is located by one of Jim's
favorite eateries - the Roadside Diner in Wall Township. He lived
in nearby Farmingdale &amp; ate here nearly every day. He would
periodically swap out the sculpture changing from one giant
colorful dinosaur to another. The building itself is a central
Jersey classic. It opened in 1950 as the Silk City serving hearty
breakfasts &amp; lunches - a tradition that continues to this day.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The History:&lt;/b&gt;
The trademarked PEZ name describes the brand of Austrian confection ... and the range of themed plastic dispensers for such said candy.  The very first candy flavor offered by the PEZ company, peppermint (which in German is Pfefferminz) ... was first introduced in 1927 in Austria ... and first sold in the U.S. in 1952. The PEZ name is formed from three of the letters of this German word.  Although most people think of the dispenser when they hear the name PEZ ... the company considers itself a confectioner (candy maker) ... which manufactures and exports worldwide ... with over 3 billion of the small candies consumed each year in the U.S. alone.  The current style of dispenser most notably recognized w/ heads atop were introduced in 1955 .. with over 1500 variations produced to date.   The candies are currently manufactured in Austria and the U.S. (Connecticut) ... with the dispensers made in Hungary and China.

 PEZ dispensers are widely collected ... with some specific styles worth hundreds of dollars ... and the highest amounts ranging into the thousands of dollars.  The community of collectors has grown steadily thru the companie's history ... and there are numerous conventions held annually worldwide soley for the purpose of discussing, trading, and the merchandising of PEZ products and paraphanlia.

&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;
(Within) 'In The Land of PEZ' you'll find an array of strange and unique characters.  You might see Mickey Mouse ... or maybe that famous pirate from Pirates of the Carribean.  Or how about Casper the Friendly Ghost, one of your favorite NASCAR drivers, or even a super hero like Batman or Superman.  

Please trade even/up w/ another PEZ dispenser if you plan on taking one from the container so that other visitors can have the same 'sweet' PEZ experience.

PEZ dispensers often have special connections in people's lives ... be it their first experience or some funny story involving the PEZ candy dispenser.  If you have a PEZ story of your own that you'd like to share include it in your comments below.


&lt;b&gt;The Location:&lt;/b&gt;
The cache is hidden in the northwest section of Joe Palaia park in Ocean Township, NJ.  You can park in the north lot off of Dow Av. and make your way south down the paved path about a quarter mile ... then head west on the dirt path/road (usually muddy) until it turns to the south.  Container is about a hundred feet down this path and a hundred feet off the path.  See hint for further location info.  </groundspeak:long_description>

I've been ill so I decided to venture out to try and clear my head. I never did buy that cold weather makes you sick(er). :smile: Besides, it was a balmy 38 so I sauntered over to Freehold and parked in a spot that someone had shoveled out in front of their house. Yes, a Breach of winter protocol but they were probably at work so I could make a clean cache and dash and be out before they ever knew I was here. Unfortunately, I failed to dash anything or stay clean as the snow was up over my knees in spots. Still, the air was crisp and the fresh so I enjoyed the snow-scramble. Found myself at GZ and started clearing snow but then repositioned myself for a better look. Aha! No clearing necessary. [;)] Just as I extracted the log a pair of muggles walked by on the sidewalk giving me a strange look. Well, what can I say... Some people just don't understand the allure of scoping out WW2 military equipment while wading through a foot of snow. :grin: TNLNSL and replaced as I found it. I followed my own footsteps back to the car and spent a few minutes digging out the snow that had Breached my boot. Thanks for yet another winter friendly find!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Find&lt;/b&gt;
This is an offset cache with the above listed coordinates pointing to the first stage of two.  At this location is the Inukshuk (see description below) ... which sits in the middle of a small creek that feeds into a larger marshy area.  The cache you are searching for (second of two) is 160 ft due East of the Inukshuk rock pile.  It's a cammo'd lock &amp; lock container just off the ground on the edge of the marsh ... about 30 ft off the trail.

&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;
A 'pile of rocks' is known by a few different names. Cairn is the most common term ... but it could also be referred to as a 'trail duck' ... or in some interactive instances where you add your own rock to the pile it's a ritual known as 'isivivane'. Cairns are generally used as a marker of some type. In some cases they may represent some historical/memorial commemoration ... or they might just provide some decorative/artistic value.  

This 'rock pile' is a special form known as an Inukshuk (or Inuksuk) ... which sources from the Inuit Indian tribes of Arctic North America (Canada, Alaska, Greenland).  

The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting or as a food cache.  Historically the most common type of inuksuk is a single stone positioned in an upright manner.  The word inuksuk means &quot;something which acts for or performs the function of a person&quot;. The word comes from the morphemes inuk (&quot;person&quot;) and -suk (&quot;ersatz&quot; or &quot;substitute&quot;).

(&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Please don't 'futz' with the Inukshuk.  Adding or removing rocks from the structure are likely to make it unstable.  See my other 'rock pile' caches for interactive options). 

&lt;b&gt;Best Approach&lt;/b&gt;
This cache is located in Weltz Park in Ocean Township, NJ.   This is a Green Acres tract that is part of the Monmouth County Parks System ... and is one of their (mostly) undeveloped parks.  Park in the small parking lot on West Park Av on the south side of park.  Take the main trail (a Sycamore tree lined dirt road) heading north.   About a quarter mile down this straight road/path will be a crossing of a small creek. The 'rock pile' is in this creek ... east of the crossing ... and the cache is alongside the creek a bit further east.  Backtrack (southbound) about fifty feet from creek crossing and take eastbound trail about a hundred feet to get closer look at Inukshuk.  Cache is another 160 ft down the path (going east) ... and alongside the marsh the creek feeds into.

Please be on lookout for muggles roaming this quiet park.  There aren't usually a lot of people in this park ... but there's a steady stream of visitors throughout the day ... walking, running, or even on horseback.  This path is the only 'dry' crossing of this creek ... so every visitor will pass by at one point or another.  Don't give away the Inukshuk location as this will compromise it's sustainability.  Please defer your approach if other park visitors are nearby.

The thickness of the briers reminded me of my experience at ENDURING FREEDOM. Of course, there was a better way in which I would find only after getting to GZ and discovering the well hidden cache. I'm not sure the cache was where it used to be based on the previous logs and where the geo-pile was situated. It was in good shape anyway. I TN, dropped in a spare pencil &amp; signed in. I re-hid the cache up a little higher out of the thorns where I found the geo-camo. Only moved 2 foot and not enough to change the difficulty and hopefully back where it used to be.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On November 8th, 2008, Circuit City Stores announced the immediate&lt;br/&gt;liquidation and closure of 155 retail stores across the country.&lt;br/&gt;#3671 in Freehold, NJ was among those slated for closure in an&lt;br/&gt;effort to save the company from total bankruptcy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a somewhat unique point of view on these events, since I&lt;br/&gt;had put the previous 5 years of my life into that store as a sales&lt;br/&gt;associate, computer technician, and manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my tenure, I personally sold nearly a million dollars in&lt;br/&gt;inventory, fixed two thousand computers, and called the police for&lt;br/&gt;various reasons 12 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing the store was difficult for everyone involved, not just&lt;br/&gt;for the customers that shopped there, but for the dozens of&lt;br/&gt;employees working there. Following are some memories of life at&lt;br/&gt;Circuit City during and after the closing. I wish I had some&lt;br/&gt;pictures of when the store was fully operational, but I never&lt;br/&gt;thought I would need a picture to remember the store when it was&lt;br/&gt;alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache is a micro magnetized somewhere in a typical fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Cache is not at the posted coordinates!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There you shall find this cache's namesake. Nearby you will find a
regular sized Lock&amp;Lock container... if you can answer the
below questions.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt; As you stand near
the posted coordinates, you will see the impressive Monmouth County
Park System Visitors Center. It was recently reconstructed after
being completely destroyed by fire a few years ago. The fire was
started by a contractor working with a welding torch to install
rain gutters and then fueled by gusting winds. Over 100
firefighters fought the blaze but in the end the building was
destroyed. They did manage to save most of the majestic trees that
surrounded the mansion and the original chimneys. The current
building is, in outward appearances, very similar to the original.
The inside however has been completely modernized to include an
elevator, sprinkler system, offices and exhibit space dedicated to
the history of the Thompson Park &amp; the Visitors Center. To
complete this puzzle I recommend stopping by the visitor center.
You'll learn all you need to know and lots more! It is open on
weekdays from 8 to 4:30 and weekends from 10 to 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A) Who bequeathed the original visitors center to the
county?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    8 - Mary Longstreet Holmes Duncan&lt;br/&gt;
    9 - Geraldine Livingston Thompson&lt;br/&gt;
    8 - William Leeds&lt;br/&gt;
    9 - Maurice Pollak&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B) What was the name of the farm on which the visitors center
now stands?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    0 - Marlu Farm&lt;br/&gt;
    3 - Thompson Fields&lt;br/&gt;
    6 - Lincroft Stables&lt;br/&gt;
    9 - Brookdale Farm&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C) What year was the original building constructed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    1 - 1896&lt;br/&gt;
    3 - 1986&lt;br/&gt;
    5 - 1869&lt;br/&gt;
    7 - 1968&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D) When did the original building burn down?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    4 - February 2006&lt;br/&gt;
    3 - December 2005&lt;br/&gt;
    4 - February 2007&lt;br/&gt;
    3 - December 2006&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E) Twentytwo foot tall doric columns graced front porch of the
original building in what configuration?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    3 - 2 Sets of Triple Pillars&lt;br/&gt;
    5 - 3 Sets of Triple Pillars&lt;br/&gt;
    7 - 4 Sets of Double Pillars&lt;br/&gt;
    9 - 5 Sets of Double Pillars&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F) The first filly to win the Kentucky Derby was bred right here
in Thompson Park. What was her name?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    0 - Regret&lt;br/&gt;
    2 - Genuine Risk&lt;br/&gt;
    4 - Rachel Alexandra&lt;br/&gt;
    6 - Winning Colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is located at &lt;b&gt;N40 19.ABC
W074 08.DEF&lt;/b&gt;. Substitute the number associated with the correct
answer to get the coordinates. Good luck &amp; happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;

Pond&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hike:&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the South parking lot in
Holmdel Park or at the Ramanessin Greenway entrance or Bayonet
Farm. You'll enjoy a nice mile to a mile and a half walk no matter
where you choose to begin. The trails get muddy after a rain but
they are well defined and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hide:&lt;/strong&gt; Cache is an ammo can, but it's
concealed differently than usual. Could be a tough hide but the
clue will be very helpful. I suggest approaching GZ from the North.
If you come from the South you'll have to test your mettle. Will it
hold you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History:&lt;/strong&gt; Colonial ownership of this land
dates back to the 1600s and the Holmes family from which Holmdel
gets it's name. Clare Pond is dedicated to Mrs. Clare Prentice,
wife of Bernon Prentice. He had it built in November of 1929 in
memory of his departed wife. That year, Bernon also remodeled the
home &amp; landscaped the grounds. Though the Prentice homestead
has vanished, Clare Pond lives on as a symbol of their love. At one
time the pond was ringed with gardens and ornamental shrubs and
some of the evergreen shrubbery is still present along the North
side.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Prior to moving to Central Jersey, the Prentices resided in New
York City where Bernon was listed in the Who's Who of Finance &amp;
Banking. They're names frequently appeared in the New York Times
gossip columns. It's not surprising that they ended up moving out
to the country to escape the public scrutiny. There was more to the
couple than just finance &amp; banking however. Clare, along with
her famous brother Lincoln Ellsworth, funded works of art
throughout the region. Bernon was a decorated officer in World War
1 with the Red Cross. They were married 100 years ago this week
(December 29th 1908). Happy Anniversary Clare &amp; Bernon!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Longstreet farm is a &quot;living history&quot; farm in Holmdel, Monmouth County, NJ. Take in the sights, smells &amp; sounds of rural life in the 1890s. Watch the costumed interpretive staff plow, plant, harvest, cook &amp; clean, honoring the methods &amp; customs of the 19th century. Visit the blacksmith (demonstrations every 2rd Sunday 1-3PM), step inside the massive Dutch Barn, help milk a cow or grind corn, pet the horses, mules, sheep, hogs &amp; chickens that roam the grounds. There's something going on at the farm in all seasons - just as there would be in a 19th century farm. The farm is open daily from 10am to 4pm and from 9am to 5pm between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Admission &amp; parking is free. The posted coordinates will bring you to the visitor center and a standard micro hide. The cachetainer is small enough for only the log, a pencil fragment and the smallest of small swag but pathtags fit nicely.

Today I took a wrong turn trying to follow detours around Solebury
township. I ended up at a park I have never seen before. A park I
have not seen on the map because there was no cache here. Until
today. So I hopped out of the car, and found a good spot. You will
not need to go on any private property to find this cache, but you
may need to go through poison ivy or pick up some ticks. I averaged
the coordinates but my GPSr has been acting strangely at times
lately, so they might be a little off. If so, let me know and I
will update the coordinates.

Take the Blue trail behind the tennis courts to the marsh trail. The cache is a medium size red tupperware container. The terrian starts off very easy, but if you continue on the right way it will not be so easy! When you are done stop by the pond and the farm and see the animals! 

&quot;Originally posted on Geocaching.com on 10/27/2001 by WormsRock! It fell into disrepair and the reviewers archived it before I could make the adoption go through. I still maintain the cache even though nobody could log it until now. Enjoy this bit of history and great location!&quot;

The Big Cinnamon Stick is a single stage hide that was inspired by a large fallen tree lying right next to a wooded path in Holmdel Park in Monmouth County, NJ.  This fallen tree looks exactly like a huge rolled cinnamon stick.  The cache is hidden 'near' this large fallen tree (refer to the listed coordinates above for the exact location of the hide).  

&lt;b&gt;Best Approach&lt;/b&gt;
Park in the Hill Top lot at the north end of the park (near the tennis courts).  Enter the Ridge Walk trail behind the tennis courts heading east.  Take the High Point trail down the ridge side (blue trail) till you get to the Marsh trail.  Take the Marsh trail a couple hundred yards until you come upon the 'big cinnamon stick'.  

&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;
Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several trees from the genus Cinnamomum that is used in both sweet and savoury foods. Cinnamon trees are native to South East Asia, and its origin was mysterious in Europe until the sixteenth century.

Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BCE.  Cinnamon was once so highly-prized that wars were fought over it, it was used as currency, and it has aphrodisiacal powers. The Hebrew Bible makes specific mention of the spice many times.  It was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god. 
 
To protect their monopoly as suppliers, its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade.  Through the Middle Ages, the source of cinnamon was a mystery to the Western world.  In Herodotus and other authors, Arabia was the source of cinnamon: giant Cinnamon birds collected the cinnamon sticks from an unknown land where the cinnamon trees grew and used them to construct their nests.  This myth about the source of cinnamon existed for centuries before it's true source (native to Sri Lanka) was understood.  

Medieval physicians used cinnamon in medicines to treat coughing, hoarseness and sore throats. As a sign of remorse, Roman Emperor Nero ordered a year's supply of cinnamon be burnt after he murdered his wife.  By 1833, the downfall of the cinnamon monopoly had begun when other countries found it could be easily grown in such areas as Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Mauritius, Réunion and Guyana. Cinnamon is now also grown in South America, the West Indies, and other tropical climates. 

Cinnamon is harvested by growing the tree for two years then coppicing (periodic cutting/pruning) it. The next year, about a dozen shoots will form from the roots.  The branches harvested this way are processed by scraping off the outer bark, then beating the branch evenly with a hammer to loosen the inner bark. The inner bark is then prised out in long rolls.

a tour of Tatum's trees&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the hunter's
tree-stand 100 foot south of stage one. The hunter has been seen
here on Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees are at the heart of geocaching. While upright they provide
the landscape of our game. At their end they provide our hiding
spots &amp; muggle cover. They are shade on a summer day, the
warmth on a winter night, the foundation for the birders &amp; the
challenge for the climbers. They hold the waters and anchor the
earth to the sky. They are the sanctuary to the small and fragile
and the guardians of the breath. This cache is for the trees - my
strong silent friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growing up I was always a fan of Shel Silverstein's books.
I found his unique outlook and simple illustrations very appealing.
Later I grew up to appreciate the works on different levels. My
favorite book of his was always &lt;i&gt;The Giving Tree&lt;/i&gt;. The story
follows the life of a tree as it watches a boy grow up. The story
often invokes a strong response and is much deeper than the
simplistic writing style and line art convey. I'll let you form
your own opinions but to see the story as I do consider: Every word
is true. The tree is happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a four stage multi-cache. The purpose is to direct
you around Tatum Park on a tour of the park's most interesting
trees. Not every one was a good spot for a cache so those are
simply waymarked. No micros here - all of the stages are small
painted lock-n-locks. Feel free to drop swag/trade along the way as
the final is &quot;log only&quot;. Very little bushwhacking is necessary but
there are thorns &amp; poison ivy along the way. From start to
finish the hike is about a mile depending on your route but
probably double that with the round trip from parking. The park is
open dawn to dusk. Grab a map, hit the trails and keep your eyes
peeled for groundhogs, rabbits, raccoons, skunks &amp; deer
throughout this wonderful park. This cache has been a labor of love
for me and I hope you enjoy it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;For every group finding this cache a copy of &lt;i&gt;The
Giving Tree&lt;/i&gt; will be purchased and donated to charity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This cache is certified &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://CentralJerseyGeocaching.net&quot;&gt;Central

The cache is hidden in a small plastic box with a snap lid. It's clearly marked as a Geocache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;A kid-friendly cache &amp; a short walk around the North side of
Tatum Park where, if you're lucky, you'll get to meet one of the
last Weedlins in all of New Jersey.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mythology:&lt;/b&gt; If the Ents are the shepherds of the
forest, then the Weedlins are the shepherds of meadows &amp;
wildflowers. They're part of the landscape of nature itself. Like
weeds they're plucky, mischievous &amp; protective of their lands.
The ancient Greeks called them the Lemoniads. The Native Americans
left them offerings. Colonial Farmers gave them their modern name
but revered them for renewing the fields &amp; protecting the land
from erosion. Now a days they're hard to come by but I've
discovered at least one living in Tatum Park. I hid a cache nearby
which, if the Weedlin hasn't eaten it yet again, shouldn't be too
hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend:&lt;/b&gt; In the Summer of 1779 the land of Tatum Park
was a small farm owned by a family that was struggling to just keep
the farm running. To make matters worse, British soldiers were
occupying their land. Young Emily had a magnificent garden of
native flowers, but the wildflowers that grew in the meadows were
her favorite. Emily watched with irritation as the troops made camp
in a field that was being allowed to grow natural that season. They
crushed down her beloved wildflowers &amp; greedily ate the berries
she had been cultivating all Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the soldiers took notice &amp; saved a large bouquet of
flowers, which he presented to her one morning. Despite their
differences, the two fell in love. Though she never tried to change
his mind, her love of the land was infectious &amp; soon after
being deployed into battle the young soldier defected to the
Colonial Army. He promised to marry her when he returned. He wrote
to Emily frequently over the next year but one day the letters
stopped coming. The years piled up, the war ended &amp; she lost
hope &amp; began to despair. She was inconsolable. As Emily's
health began to fail so did the farm. Crops withered, fruits dried
on the vine &amp; not a flower could be seen on the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the occasion of the first frost in 1783 Emily took a walk in
the North East meadow, sat down to rest under a willow tree &amp;
never woke up. She was buried in that same meadow. On Christmas Eve
of that season her lover finally returned. He had been captured by
the British &amp; sent over seas as a prisoner of war. The
revolution ended before he could stand trial &amp; eventually he
was able to make his way back to the colonies. Her soldier was
saddened when he heard the news of her death but war had hardened
him &amp; he could shed no tears. Emily's mother led him to the
gravesite. As he knelt by Emily's final resting place, her Mother
placed a bundle of dried flowers alongside the headstone. The
soldier recognized the flowers as the very bouquet he gave her when
they first met. His heart finally broke &amp; he began to weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Spring life returned to the farm when a lone
Morning Glory bloom unfolded to greet the dawn. It had sprouted
alongside Emily's grave where her love's tears fell to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hide:&lt;/b&gt; Bring the kids! Take the Dogwood Hollow trail
&amp; a short unnamed trail to within 15 feet of the cache. You'll
be hunting for a non-traditional cache container hidden in a
traditional way. &lt;b&gt;The Weedlin kept stealing my original
containers so I moved the cache a little further outside the
meadow.&lt;/b&gt; If you find one of these original cache containers
(possibly near the Weedlin) please feel free to grab it and rehide
it. The containers are ready to go with a pencil, log &amp; swag.
Just mention in your log that you snagged one of the Weedlin’s
caches. In this way the beneficial, if mischievous Weedlins can
expand their habitats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Park:&lt;/b&gt; Monmouth County's Tatum Park contains 366 acres
of woods &amp; fields including a playground &amp; six miles of
trails. You can park at either the Red Hill Road or Holland Rd
activity centers. While in the area be sure to visit Emily's old
homestead &amp; the possible remains of her flowerbed:

Cheesequake's tidal estuary.&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Salt Hay?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Salt Hay, when mentioned in East Jersey of olde, referred to
Spartina Patens, which is a type of natural cord grass that grows
throughout salt marshes along the Eastern Seaboard. While growing,
the grass is extremely hardy, well suited to be used as feed for
grazing animals and can be harvested twice a year without
cultivation. After being harvested it is extremely resistant to rot
and lightweight making it ideal for wintertime feed storage. Cattle
actually preferred the salt hay to field hay or grass.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The History:&lt;/b&gt; Since colonial days, the grass has been very
useful to farmers. Cows, sheep, goats &amp; horses grazed in the
salt meadows in warm months and fed off of the dried salt hay in
the winter. The grass could also be twisted into twine which would
then be used to bind the salt hay bales for transport. Salt Hay's
resistance to rot is unparalleled making it excellent to be used as
packing material for glass, pottery &amp; fresh produce, thatch for
roofs, bedding for animals, stuffing for mattresses and insulation
for walls. Many an old farmhouse has been torn down only to find
salt hay stuffed into the walls and ceilings.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As useful
as it was, salt hay was just as difficult to farm. The fields were
by nature, muddy, pitched and rutted. The work was hard, dirty and
dangerous for man and beast. The horses that were used to pull the
wagons across the marsh had to wear special wide shoes and bags
over their heads to avoid the masses of biting and stinging
insects. The farmers wore thick canvas coveralls, long sleeve
shirts and hats even in the summer. With their vision limited they
often broke legs stepping into tidal pools and muskrat holes. The
hay would be cut by hand with scythes, bundled into huge piles and
left to dry. Eventually they would be loaded onto flat scows and
pulled upstream where the hay would be forked into boats, wagons or
trains. In 1835 a ton of salt hay could be sold for $3. By 1900 it
was trading at $5/ton and as more and more salt marshes were
developed for other purposes the price rose as high as $25 per ton
by the 1950s before synthetic materials were introduced and the
demand began to fall. By this time the farming had been mostly
industrialized with double-wheeled tractors taking the place of
mud-shoed horses. Marshes were often &quot;reclaimed&quot; - dredged,
channeled and dammed from tidal inundation. The channels cut into
the Cheesequake marsh are evidence of a local reclamation effort.
The Federal Wetlands Preservation Act of 1970 forbade further
reclamation making things that much harder for the struggling
industry. Forty years later however there are still a few farmers
scratching out a living by &quot;mowing the medders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hide:&lt;/b&gt; I hid this on July 1st 2010 and then got
delayed doing research and before I realized it was Fall and I
decided to wait until Spring before publishing. The interim 9 month
span dissolved the camo but the hide is secure. You're looking for
a small lock-n-lock hidden in a standard fashion. GZ is on a berm
that is occasionally an island. It's a great place to sit and watch
the ospreys hunt while route 35 silently churns in the distance. If
you're lucky you can catch the deer pass by near dusk and dawn. The
cache can be accessed at all but high tide but be sure to check the

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;On the great
sea-marsh where the eddies stray,&lt;br/&gt;
The mower strikes ere yet the dew is fled.&lt;br/&gt;
The salt-hay falls before his heavy tread,&lt;br/&gt;
Filling with odorous breath the whole green way.&lt;br/&gt;
On the tide's back, now with the broadened day,&lt;br/&gt;
Like a mild beast of burden slowly led,&lt;br/&gt;
The floating grass is meshed and gathered;&lt;br/&gt;
A great tide-harvest of salt-smelling hay.&lt;br/&gt;
Where herons stalk, and the shy mallard hides&lt;br/&gt;
In stillest haunts, is the man-worker seen---&lt;br/&gt;
Even the sea must garner for his good.&lt;br/&gt;
Soon high and dark above the marsh and tides,&lt;br/&gt;
Stand the great hay-towers; as they loom and lean,&lt;br/&gt;
Like turrets grim to mark the solitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Go and get it (if you dare). The cache is a Bison Tube, hidden in a halloween setting. Park your car at the parking coordinates and follow the old Railroad bed.

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

This is a part of the Curses of the FTF series.

This is a short 1/2 hour multi that can be fun for the whole family. Take advantage of the nearby playground and bring a snack for the picnic tables. This park is usually pretty empty unless there is a ball or a tennis game going on, in which case we suggest you return at a less busy time. The first stage was the creative crafty work by Cura's wife. The second stage will require some height or team work, the cache owner Cura is 6'4! The third and final stage is fun and once you have the coordinates you can't miss it. 

The trophy travel bug comes with special instructions. Please read the instructions before you take it.

Congrats to swampland'r for FTF and mblatch for taking the trophy

Quick Cache (just for the numbers)

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

Somethings don't look the same from the outside in. This can be one of those things.

In the summer time I would highly recommend pants, and after rain some boots. The Passaic does run through parts of this park, so many times it can get swampy here. Be sure to BRING BUGSPRAY!!

Please replace the cache as found, small trade items are welcome.

GOOD LUCK!

This cache is one of many in the “Along the Raritan” series. These caches will offer great views, fishing, and hiking along a great local river. There should be minor bushwhacking if any to access the caches. Please rehide all caches as found.

Access from River Road park or off of Miller Lane. Head off of main paved trail to blue trail that follows the river.

A camoed 4x4 plastic box in a quite little park in Glen Garnder, NJ.  Lots of parking within 200 feet.  This area flooded recently but should be good till the next 100 year flood.  Poor drainage after rains.  About 10 feet from the grass.

Califon was a station on the High Bridge Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The rail line was abandoned in 1976 and now serves as a Hunterdon County-administered rail trail called Columbia Trail, which runs south to High Bridge and north to points in Morris County.

Though the mills were present in the area of Califon for some time prior to its incorporation as a town, it was quite a while before growth became evident in the mid-nineteenth century. It was first called California, from Jacob Neighbor's enthusiasm in the milling business about the time the California Gold Rush broke out. The Borough was incorporated by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of both Lebanon and Tewksbury Townships on April 2, 1918.[9] Local legend has it that California became a regular stop for weekend excursion trains through the countryside. When riders bought their tickets they were issued a voucher good for an ice cream; the train would stop so tourists could wander around and cash in their ice cream coupons. Anxious to exploit this source of outside revenue, residents petitioned the Railroad to let them build a real station, which they did as a community project. The station is said to be the one shown in the picture on the right. Citing the local account again, two sign painters who came to letter the sign rode the train from Dunellen, but the background paint wasn't dry when they arrived. They sat and drank at the hotel, which later burned down. By the time the sign was ready for their artistic touch, the local tale says, &quot;Califon&quot; was as close to California as the inebriated painters could manage. Califon is also situated just north of the Kenneth Lockwood Gorge on the South Branch of the Raritan River; this pristine stretch of clear water and forest is a well-known treasure for New Jersey trout fishermen.

The Califon Historical Society has registered 170 structures with the National Register of Historic Places. Califon is a Victorian-style enclave where the houses are marked with the names of the builders and their dates of establishment rather than with street numbers. The center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough. Recently the State of New Jersey announced they were going to replace the bridge, using the fact that a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved. (Account featured on Califon website).
Califon became a regional household name when frequently mentioned by Merv Griffin on his TV show during the 1970s. He and his wife Juliette owned a home in nearby Lebanon Township, which had a Califon mailing address, and, while they were married, they were often seen visiting the village in a fringed-top Bermuda-style resort cart.

A camoed pill bottle in the parking lot of a closed restaurant.  You will have the place to yourself except for the few drivers that use the lot as a short cut between roads.

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

The Snowy Day Cache Series is simply a dash and cache you can locate after a snow storm when you want to go caching. The Snowy Day cache locations should be easy to locate on a snowy day, sign the log, then be on your way. The Snowy Day caches are higher off the ground so there is no need for searching for a cache on the ground under the snow. This cache is protected but may be slightly snow covered after a storm.

Loantaka Brook Reservation offers 5 miles of multi-use paved trails stretching throughout the park. This Morris County Park got its name from the Native American Lenni-Lenape Tribe. Loantaka means &quot;the place of the cold winter&quot; which refers to the Great Swamp and surrounding area.

This cache is placed for all those dedicated geocachers who brave all the weather elements to seek a geocache and keep their streak alive.

&quot;Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these geocacher couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds&quot;

NNJC is about promoting a quality caching experience in Northern New Jersey.

This area contains critical wetlands, vernal pools, forested areas, and the Silver Brook, a feeder stream to the Passaic River.

This cattail marsh is a wet depression in an open area with no canopy cover. Years ago it may have been a much deeper pond that has gradually filled in. This spot has become home to Great Blue Herons, green frogs and spring peepers. In 2010 a new boardwalk has been constructed through the cattail marsh.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Great Swamp Watershed Association, founded in 1981, is dedicated to protecting and improving water resources in the ten towns that comprise Great Swamp watershed by monitoring local streams, advocating for intelligent land use, and educating our communities about water quality and quantity and their effect on the health and natural beauty of the local environment. The ten towns are: Bernardsville, Bernards Township, Chatham Township, Harding Township, Long Hill Township, Madison Borough, Mendham Borough, Mendham Township, Morristown and Morris Township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Swamp Watershed is a 55-square-mile region in Morris and Somerset Counties of the state of New Jersey, and includes portions of ten different towns. A watershed is a geographical area all of whose streams flow into a single body of water. In the Great Swamp Watershed, five streams – the Upper Passaic River, Black Brook, Great Brook, Loantaka Brook, and Primrose Brook all flow into Great Swamp and exit as the Passaic River via Millington Gorge.</groundspeak:long_description>

The GPS might be off a little (used 3 different GPS' to get the coords) because of the leaves and a mountain ridge full of iron.  (The Hint will make up for the coords.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A camoed 4x4x6 L&amp;L that is almost a C&amp;D at the parking lot of Point Mountain, a GREAT VIEW from the top at 932 feet.  Over looks the Musconetcong Valley.  Lots of fishing by the bridge about 100 feet away.  Several hiking trails from this parking lot.  Enjoy  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Point Mountain is one of the highest mountains in NJ. There is a great overlook and lots of trails. One trail goes up to the overlook and then splits, one trail goes to the north and center sections of the park along the mountain ridge thru the woods. The other branch goes south thru woods and the a large grass field. There are two trails along the river. Walk on! This is a county park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The legend of the headless horseman has appeared in many forms of literature throughout history and throughout the world. Many countries have their own unique version of the legend in which some form of the headless horseman appears.
 
The most recognizable headless horseman is the one that appears in Washington Irving's short story, which was published in 1819. The story is set in America, within a 1790's Dutch settlement that residents nicknamed “Sleepy Hollow”. Its protagonist is a schoolteacher named Ichabod Crane, whose apparent demise results from a meeting with the horseman. The horseman himself is allegedly a Hessian soldier from the Revolutionary War who was decapitated by a cannonball and now roams Sleepy Hollow on the back of his horse, with his severed head resting upon the pommel of his saddle. He is therefore also called the 'Galloping Hessian'.
 
The Horseman is said to be incapable of crossing the bridge at the town entrance (a possible reference to the belief that ghosts cannot cross water), although he is shown throwing his head across a river to strike down Ichabod Crane. Ichabod's fate is left ambiguous; some of the background characters allege that he has been &quot;carried off&quot; by the Horseman, while others suggest that he has been frightened out of the county by the ghost and by the prospect of facing his landlord, later to become a lawyer in Philadelphia. It is implied later that the Horseman was in fact Brom Bones, Ichabod's rival for the hand in marriage of the local beauty Katrina van Tassel, who imitated the legend of the Galloping Hessian on purpose to kill or frighten away his competitor.
 
The fact that a shattered pumpkin is found beside Ichabod's abandoned hat supports this, in that the pumpkin may easily have been used to simulate the Horseman's severed head. Intriguingly, there is no mention of a severed head in the story heard by Ichabod, though it is prominent in his own encounter with the horseman.
 
&quot;The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance ... the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak. ”

The Burnett Brook Natural Area was once owned by Stirling Tomkins.  It was his desire to preserve the land as open space and protect Mendham’s natural, rural character. 

The park has a large pond and one mile loop trail which circles the pond fed by the Burnett Brook.  There are the remains of an old shale quarry and a notable geologic feature is the Peapack Fault which runs through the park. 

The park objective is to preserve great opportunities for hiking, photography, healthy exercise, observing nature, and relaxation.  Hiking is easy and the park is a great favorite with children and nature photographers.

Caution: The area can be quite muddy at times.  Wear boots.</groundspeak:long_description>

A P&amp;G camoed magnetic bison tube in the parking lot beside a busy intersection. Try making a cell call while looking for the cache.

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

 Should be a D&amp;C. Don't forget your twizzers!!!

The Columbia Trail is a rail  to trails in  north center New Jersey. It was created from portions of the former Central Railroad  for a total of 16.2 miles. Columbia Gas Company bought the trail right-of-way and laid an underground gas pipeline under the right-of-way along the length of the trail.   County Department of Parks and Recreation  now operate and maintain the trail under lease.

The Columbia Trail is quite scenic,  a notable portion of the Columbia Trail is the Ken Lockwood Gorge,  The South Branch of the Raritan River parallels the trail through the gorge, and is a scenic fast-flowing small river with recreational activities, especially fly fishing. A 60-foot (18 meter) trestle carries the trail over the river in the gorge.

The trail surface is relatively flat and consists mostly of fine crushed stone.

Camoed pill bottle just off Heinz (Route) 57. &lt;br/&gt;
Cache is in the new, near the old. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Cache is about 200 feet south of a &quot;Grotto&quot;.  &lt;br/&gt;
From a local, &quot;the structure was erected by a German family (the original land owner) just after WW II. It was done to simulate such stuctures that are commonly found in farm areas in Europe. They  lived in the yellow house just down the road. They also constructed a grotto with both English and German signs just across the road from their house.&quot;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the stone bridge over the river and the bridge over the stream!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This cache is    NOT     listed on other sites.

For almost a century it has served residents throughout the northern part of the state, dedicated to the performing and visual arts. Formerly called &quot;Twin Oaks,&quot; this neo-Georgian style mansion was built as a Frelinghuysen home. The building also includes a modern addition housing The John H. Bickford Theatre.

The mission of the Morris Museum is to elevate the cultural consciousness, excite the mind and enhance the quality of life by advancing the understanding and enjoyment of the visual and performing arts, natural and physical sciences, and humanities through exhibitions, performances and educational programs in a welcoming, inclusive and creative environment that responsibly uses all museum resources, including stewardship of a permanent collection.

A P&amp;G camoed pill bottle at a road side table. Over the last 30 years I have released at least 40 racoons from &quot;have a heart&quot; traps here.  There is a small stream back there plus people food in the trash can.  None of the racoons have ever come out to say hi. :-(

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Patriots' Path is a network of hiking, biking and equestrian trails and green open spaces linking several dozen Federal, state, county and municipal parks, watershed lands, historic sites and other points of interest across Morris County. The Patriots' Path stretches from East Hanover which connects with the Lenape Trail in Essex County to Allamuchy Mountain State Park in Sussex County and the Village of High Bridge in Hunterdon County.

The purpose of the Patriots' path trail system is to provide opportunities for passive outdoor recreation while protecting and enhancing the environmental and aesthetic integrity of the stream valleys and uplands through which it passes. Much of the Path lies along the corridors of the Whippany and Black Rivers and the South Branch of the Raritan. The Black River and South Branch of the Raritan are two of the most pristine trout production streams in the state.

The trail system is stabilized in many sections with crushed stone and gravel, other areas are left as narrow paths on earth and rock and shorter sections in Morristown and Morris Twp. area are paved. Several miles lie on cinder and gravel beds of old railroad lines.

The Patriots' Path cache is located along a section of the scenic Whippany River, unfortunately the noise from route 287 interrupts this peaceful serenity, but enjoy the flowing river views as you hike along the Patriots' Path. This cache can be found in winter as it is not on the ground.

The Snowy Day cache locations should be easy to locate on a snowy day, sign the log, then be on your way. The Snowy Day caches are higher off the ground so there is no need for searching for a cache on the ground under the snow.

This (SDCS) cache is located at the Morris County Public Library, stop in on a Snowy day, grab the cache and then grab a good book to read, maybe on Geocaching.

This cache is placed for all those dedicated geocachers who brave all the weather elements to seek a geocache.

&quot;Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these geocacher couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds&quot;

A P&amp;G camoed pill bottle on the road right of way.  Near the entrance to county trash to energy incinerator.

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to the memory of our German Shepherd,
Eick von Wolfsrevier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Eick (“Ike”) was a magnificent working dog with dozens of
competition awards from local and regional events. He was trained,
by my wife, in Schutzhund (tracking, obedience and protection)
which simulates international police work. As a team, they earned
the highest international title in Schutzhund (SchH 3) and dozens
of trophies and awards.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Eick loved this park. As a family, we spent many, many enjoyable
hours here both training and having fun. Eick’s cache is filled
with lots of doggie things and toys.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Parking is available. There are several routes to the cache but the
most enjoyable is from the trailhead waypoint. A trail map is
posted there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1GZY9 - Community Center Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 53.863 W 074° 21.790&lt;br/&gt;Community Center Parking Lot&lt;br/&gt;TH1GZY9 - Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 53.959 W 074° 21.677&lt;br/&gt;Trailhead</groundspeak:long_description>

I wanted to pay my respects to Eik and Alan by coming here first but it was not to be so I come here on a half dollar miles stone..


Eik looks like a handsome and smart dog which his training exemplifies.  The cache was fun and I too followed the blue trail on this wonderful fall day.  Very much enjoyed this vista near the. cache. When I emerged from the woods there were 12 dogs running around the lawn up here.  Some of the dogs needed the exercise.


Exchanged TBs

Thanks for placing and maintaining this cache Alan.

Pugnuts have been fixing up their house and getting it ready for
the final sale.  Then, it is off to the nice warm &quot;Peach
State&quot; for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that we all collect so much
&quot;junk&quot; in our homes that moving is not fun and no matter how much
we send ahead with the movers, there is always a ton of stuff (and
the dogs) that must be crammed into the car at the last
minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park and grab is a tribute to
them as good friends and a hope that their car can hold all that
last minute stuff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dearest friends and great
caching companions, The Pugnuts (Mark and Lynnea), are moving to
Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past two years, Mark
and Lynnea have been great friends to everyone in the geocaching
community.  We have been very fortunate to have them as active
members of the NNJC.  They have always been there to help the
newbies, to explain a puzzle problem, and to volunteer at
events.  And, let us not forget the ceaseless activity as a
PAF to all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mark was never satisfied
to try to solve a puzzle and just let it go as unsolvable. 
Oh, no, no, no!  Instead, he would become an absolute
bulldog.  He would keep working at it for weeks.  He was
tenacious and never would quit.  I am sure that many of the
puzzle cache owners were totally relieved when he finally got the
solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Lynnea is one of those
geocachers that has been gifted with the ability to guess, from 50
feet away, where a cache is hidden.  She has been correct on
so many occasions that it is unbelievable.  That capability,
plus the tri-axial compass on the Oregon 450 is an unbeatable
combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, off they go to a
warmer climate and leave behind many good friends that will suffer
through another New Jersey winter as they bask in the Georgia
sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that it was only
fitting that we put out a cache in their honor. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;In Montville
Township, just at the junction of River Road and Church Lane are
the remains of the stone foundations of Josiah Zabriskie’s
Gristmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact date of
the construction of the gristmill is unknown, but it already
existed on property when it was purchased in 1781. It is probable
that the construction occurred around 1760. The mill was a small
structure with two runs of stones and an undershot water wheel
powered by the Rockaway River. The force of the running river
turned a paddle wheel which rotated a large mill-stone on a
bed-stone, and was used to grind grain into flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just across the
road from the mill was the home of Zabriskie family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinypic.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, all that
remains of the gristmill are some of the stones of the foundation
of the mill and the support for the water wheel. The old dirt roads
are now paved streets. Across the road from the remains of the mill
are the former Montville Township municipal building, the local
animal shelter, some ball fields, and the local recycling center.
The house on the corner River Road and Church Lane may well be home
of the Zabriskie family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to
preserve this 250 year-old historic site, the cache is NOT located
in or on the stone foundations. Please be respectful and do not
remove or disturb any components of the structure. Enjoy the
history!  NOTE: If you take the direct route you will get wet.&lt;/p&gt;

The park is infrequently visited and is usually deserted except for a annual fishing contest or an occasional walker or two. There are some benches and  nice viewing places lakeside and a picturesque roadside dam. 
The trail to the cache is somewhat overgrown and the cache itself is surrounded by some areas of thorn bushes. There are clear approaches to the cache if chose your route wisely.
This is a simple hide. WATCH OUT FOR GHOSTS. 
 
NOTE: There is NO  PARKING on Changebridge Road. You will get a ticket. Please use the designated parking and walk along Changebridge Road to the entrance to the park.

Parked next to the dam and walked along the pretty pond to near GZ.   I really enjoyed the pond it was very pleasant views especially with all the leaves in their fall colors.  The cache was well hidden in an obvious spot.  The hint was very helpful as I was in my work clothes and dress shoes. 

Returning to my car I saw the blue lights flashing next to my car.  Oh no!  What could have happened.  I casually walked over and walked up to one of Montville's finest.  He politely questioned my choice of parking spots and suggested that the next time I visit the pond to park on one of the side streets are risk having my car get 0 MPG.   I said that was probably a good idea and he said &quot;Bye Brian&quot; as I walked back to my car.  Overall the experience was quite humorous.

The cache is under rated as a 1/1 cache though as my grandmother could not get to the cache in a wheel chair and point to the obvious hiding location.  I think Biga800 may underrate caches a bit.  However, his hiding spots and hints are excellent and I greatly appreciate his efforts to place quality caches in Northern New Jersey.  This cache is well stocked with fun things!

For many years I worked in Rockville Centre, Long Island and commuted from New Jersey.  

Aside from the immensely terrible drive each day, I was constantly reminded by my co-workers that New York was the cultural center America.  Each day they touted the vast and bountiful access that “the city” provided to food, entertainment, the fine arts, music, literature and especially theater.  

So, each day while I was being exposed to this propaganda, I could barely keep from bursting out laughing because of the exotically nasal long Island accent.  It was so hard to keep a straight face when we were talking about “cult-cha”.

So to prove them wrong, when you get this cache maybe you will be able to take the opportunity to see that culture is alive a well in the suburbs of North Jersey.

Note: You cannot park on Route 287 to get the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you back to a bygone era
when rail was king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just at the side of Johnsonburg road sits the
Allamuchy Freight Station built in 1906 to service the daily &quot;milk
run&quot; to New York City.  Local dairy farmers brought
milk-filled cans to the depot each day for transit by the Lehigh
&amp; Hudson River Railroad to the New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a few of these historic freight
stations that still remain standing in New Jersey.  The
railroad tracks that ran along the side of the station have long
since been removed and the 100+ year-old building had been left to
deteriorate for many years.  As you will see, it is now in the
process of being restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A historical footnote: On Labor Day weekend,
in 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his private train
re-routed to stop here for a for a luncheon visit with Lucy Mercer
Rutherford at the family mansion in Allamuchy.  The Rutherford
Mansion, consisted of 23 rooms built in 1903-1904 on a 1000 acre
tract.  The mansion is now commonly known as the Villa
Madonna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do NOT have to climb up on the deck or
move anything to make the find. The cache is clearly visible from
the right angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Allamuchy Freight Depot is listed on the
national and state registers of historic places:  NEW JERSEY,
WARREN COUNTY, Allamuchy Freight House, Rte. 612, Allamuchy,
#02001056, LISTED, 9/23/02&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">History of Fair Lawn History records that the area we now call Fair
Lawn was originally part of a larger area inhabited by the native
tribe, Lenni-Lenapi. As Dutch fur traders made their way up the
Hackensack and Passaic Rivers to trade with the Hackinghaesaky
Indians of the Lenni-Lenape tribe, they established trading posts
driving the Lenni-Lenapi further West. After the capture of New
Amsterdam in 1664, England acquired title to the area. Land grants
were issued, though the settlers who received them were mainly
Dutch. The Dutch settlers brought with them their &quot;Flemish Colonial
Style&quot; of building, which can still be seen throughout the area.
The General of the Bergen Militia was Andrew Hopper, whose family
had settled in Fair Lawn in 1711 and had owned large tracts of land
in the area. Hopper Avenue was named in honor of his service. Fair
Lawn Known as &quot;Small Lots&quot; As the 19th Century progressed, the
large farms which had existed were sold and divided into smaller
lots. By 1861, there were about 80 homes, most of them farmhouses.
Fair Lawn became known as &quot;Small Lots&quot;. One of the farmhouses still
standing today is the Garret-Hopper-Bogert house built in the early
1800s, and two Terhune houses on Saddle River Road. The site of a
house built during this era by Henry Hopper, a Sheriff of Bergen
County, is commemorated by a monumemt and garden. This cache is
located neat that monument at one of the last farmsteads in Fair
Lawn stood on this site. The house built by Henry Hopper in 1855
was razed for road improvements in 1989. He was Sheriff and
Freeholder of Bergen County and served in the state legislature. In
1919 William M. Croucher, Sr., bought the farm and with his sons,
Percy, Clarence and William worked the land as a truck farm until
1953. Back when New Jersey was the Garden State. Nothing remains
now except a few trees and a road marker. &lt;br/&gt;

block from this park. Over the years Cinders has been on many
walkies through many parks and had geocached with me a few
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew today he would have one last walkie, so we shared a steak
for lunch and then I brought him here one last time so he could
leave us with some good memories as his last thoughts. The park is
dog friendly and Cinders was able to get one last woof at a passing
puppy as we struggled to complete our stroll. Cinders and I went to
the vet shorty after his walkie here. I returned and placed this
memorial cache. In additional to all the other fond memories I have
of him I will always remember how happy he was to say woof to that
other dog. He was full of more energy for the 2 minutes encounter
than he had been for the last 2 months. Now I hope he is in some
better place: pain free, chasing squirrels and tennis balls and
waiting for the steaks to come off the grill.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fungus has killed off about 90 percent of NJ state's bat
population, according to scientists in 2010, who conducted an
earlier count of hibernating bats. The devastation was shocking in
the largest hibernation spot for bats in New Jersey — Morris
County's Hibernia Mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 30,000 bats normally spend the winter, but a 2010
count found only about 1,700 alive — and many of those showed
signs of infection, said a principal zoologist with the state's
Endangered and Non-game Species Program.&quot;The results we had from
Hibernia Mine were certainly not good news,&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus, called white-nose syndrome for the whitish powder
that appears on the nose, ears and wing membrane of infected bats,
was first discovered on bats in New York in 2006. It has since been
linked to the deaths of more than a million bats in 11 states, from
New Hampshire to Virginia, and has also spread to Ontario, Canada.
The virus appears to be following the path of the Appalachian
Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is unprecedented and scary,&quot; said a bat researcher at a
local University. &quot;This wave has killed more mammals in the United
States than anything in recent memory. It is entirely possible it
could sweep all the way across the country to California, killing
millions more bats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that the widespread loss of bats has potential
ramifications for humans, since bats consume huge quantities of
bugs, including insects that damage crops or carry West Nile and
other potentially fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bat deaths come at a particularly bad time in New Jersey,
where mosquito control experts worry that the recent rains and
floods have created ample breeding grounds for mosquitoes that
could result in an unusually large mosquito population. A single
bat can consume more than 3,000 mosquitoes on a single summer
night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say all six species of bats that hibernate in New
Jersey — big brown, little brown, Indiana, northern
long-eared, small-footed and tri-colored or eastern pipistrelle
— have been affected by the fungus. &quot;If this keeps going, our
bat populations will disappear,&quot; Once the population drops so
dramatically, the genetic variability of the species goes down, and
they are more susceptible to a variety of illnesses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are under pressure to quickly find a way to save the
remaining bats and stop the spreading to other states. &quot;There's not
a lot of evidence of any silver bullet that could work,&quot; said the
national white-nose syndrome coordinator with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. &quot;Part of the problem is we still don't know how
the fungal infection leads to death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running hypothesis among scientists is that the fungus
irritates hibernating bats in some way, making them act
erratically. They will emerge from their winter sleep, move about
their caves and sometimes even fly outside as if in search for food
— but all the activity causes them to burn through their fat
reserves so they are unable to survive the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists in affected states are discussing ways to help the
decimated bat population recover. They are testing various
fungicides, hoping to find one that might help bats recover without
harming them. New Jersey scientists, meanwhile, are considering
capturing several dozen infected bats, nursing them back to health,
then reintroducing them to a contaminated hibernation spot to see
if they have developed immunity to the mysterious disease. The
first signs of white-nose syndrome among bats in New Jersey in the
winter of 2008-09. The 2010 count confirmed fears that it would
decimate the population.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Hibernia Mine was one of the largest mines in NJ. It was comprised of many smaller mines, all being linked and accessed through a 4000 foot plus adit. An adit is a type of entrance to an underground mine which is horizontal or nearly horizontal. Adits are usually built into the side of a hill or mountain. This adit was so large that it needed a locomotive in order for the ore transport to be economical. This was handled by the Hibernia Underground railway, the only incorporated mine railway in NJ.

While much is known about the Revolutionary War era signifigance of the iron mines of northern New Jersey, less information is available on the railroad that facilitated the movement of iron ore to market from 1863 until the early 1900's.
 
Accounts vary as to when the original tunnel was dug and when tracks were first put down, but it is believed that by 1898, the Hibernia Underground Railroad (H.U.R.R.) was &quot;an incorporated narrow gauge railway that went as far as 317 feet below the surface and traveled along an 1,800 foot long elevated trestle.
 
The H.U.R.R. is unique in at least one aspect. While it was not the first iron mining railroad built in New Jersey, it was the first and only one to travel inside a mountain, and while early colonists and legendary captured Hessian soldiers provided the underground labor in the 1700's, Italians and Hungarians were reported to work the mines, and thus load the rail cars, in 1879 and 1891 respectively.
 
The mine itself had a succession of owners since it's beginning, the raiload also appears to have been held by various interests. Historians state that by the end of the useful mining of iron ore in New Jersey, two railroad companies had assumed control of the mine roalroads: the Central Railroad and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western.
 
Today, the abandoned railroad tunnel is the state's largest hibernaculum which had once housed 30,000 bats, until recently Surveys have shown that the bat population has greatly deminished. (see Bat cave cache page)
 
The cache is a short walk along the trail leading to the cave, after you locate the cache stop by the mine and feel the cold draft of air coming out of the mine. Please be respectful in the area.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Unlike most suburban towns whose names have little or nothing to do
with reality, Glen Rock was actually settled around an enormous
rock left by retreating glaciers in a small valley (glen). 
&lt;p&gt;

 &quot;Glen Rock is named for a 570-ton boulder, deposited by a recent
glacier, that stands near Rock Road, the town's main street. The
rock had been called Pamachapura, or Stone from Heaven, by the
Delaware (Lenape) Indians, it served as a base for Indian signal
fires and later as a trail marker for colonists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;FN17R3A - Cache is located at N 40 57.ABC   W 74 08.DEF&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;A = there are 2 years on the honor roll.  subtract the largest from the smallest
B = the 2nd digit of the year on the plaque desribing the Pamachapura
C = the # of names on the honor roll ending in &quot;ski&quot;


D = the number of men with the last name of &quot;May&quot;
E = the number of the decade the time capsule on the south side of the rock will be opened
F = The last digit of the year the time capsule was burried - 1.

Cache is near red trail.  Final stage is in Park that is closed at night.</groundspeak:long_description>

across when I accidentally left the yellow trail coming down from
High Mountain. I figured this location would be a good spot for the
cache when I was first here and the waterfall was in full power.
During times of low water you can easily explore the rock formation
that creates this unnamed waterfall. High Mountain Park Preserve
Acres Protected: 1153.7 Established: 1993 Owned and managed by: The
Nature Conservancy Wayne Township, State of New Jersey Why is This
Land Special? A natural oasis amid urban sprawl, unique High
Mountain Park is situated in the Preakness Range of the Watchung
Mountains. Rolling topography provides panoramic vistas, including
a stunning view of New York City from High Mountain's summit. The
preserve is one of the largest tracts of forested land in the
Piedmont region of northern New Jersey and encompasses a mixture of
woodlands and wetlands. Along with its open space value, the
preserve harbors rare and threatened wildlife and a globally
imperiled traprock (basalt) glade/outcrop community. Nine
ecological communities and 380 plant species, 18 of which are rare,
have been identified at the site. They include the globally
imperiled Torrey's mountain mint (Pycnanthemum torrei) and
basil-leaved mountain mint (Pycnanthemum clinopodioides), which,
along with narrow-leaved vervain (Verbena simplex), are also
classified as endangered by the state. Hazel dodder (Cuscuta
coryli), a state-imperiled plant, has been recorded as
well.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;AT13Z2V - campus parking spot (not Lot 6)&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 57.123 W 074° 12.025&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PK13Z2V - Parking near cache&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 58.778 W 074° 12.275&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RD13Z2V - Red Trailhead (South)&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 57.130 W 074° 12.014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RT13Z2V - Red Trail head (north)&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 58.768 W 074° 12.272</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;THE DEEP
VOLL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



The “Depe
Voll” ravine played a very prominent role in the history of
Wyckoff. It is likely that this natural wonder was created ... by a
melting glacier that pushed, scraped and carved thousands of tons
of rock and soil down the hill toward what is now Goffle Road. The
ancestors of the Lenape Indians are thought to have first settled
in the area about ten thousand years ago. The Lenapes called the
ravine “Muksukemuk,” and the original Dutch settlers of
the area called it “Diepte Voll” (later shortened to
“Depe Voll”), which according to some accounts
translates to “deep fall.” It certainly an apt
description of the waterfalls all along the
ravine.






&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




The 1876 Bergen
atlas noted it as “Cold Brook,” which it certainly is,
especially on hot summer days.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The 1995 U.S. Geological Survey captioned it as “Deep
Brook.” To many Wyckoff residents, it is simply known as
“the ravine.” A Favorite of Walkers and Joggers Dutch
settlers arrived in northern New Jersey in larger numbers in the
eighteenth century, and the upper portion of the ravine at
Grandview Avenue was the site of a mill owned by the Blauvelt
family. There is the remnant of a stairway leading down from Ravine
Avenue into the ravine near the intersection of Ravine and
Grandview (although it is impassable and filled with posion
ivy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In 1809, Ravine Avenue was constructed along the northerly end of
the ravine to link Grandview Avenue to Goffle Road. Now a favorite
of walkers, joggers and children who walk to school, Ravine Avenue
between Lafayette and Grandview avenues is an excellent vantage
point from which to enjoy the ravine and the woods still remaining.
In the later part of the nineteenth century, Judge Preston
Stevenson, a gentleman farmer, took over the over portion of the
ravine from descendants of the Blauvelt family. His butter molds
were imprinted with “Depe Voll” in honor of the ravine.
Account of the Paterson Rambling Club, 1907 Because of its great
beauty, this beautiful deep gorge was the site of many excursions
by naturalists-botanists and geologists-and hundreds of students
over the last century. Joseph Rydings, the leader of the Paterson
Rambling Club, reporting on one excursion around 1907, wrote, The
Ramblers have known and visited [Deep Brook GIen] for years, and
its charms have been revealed at last to many lovers of Nature
outside the Rambling Club. Man may thirst for fame, but Sylvan
Nature is a shy, retiring maiden who wants no intrusion on her
solitude, and though the poet seems to pity the flower that is born
to blush unseen, the flower itself may be supposed to rejoice in
such a condition. These thoughts occupied the mind of one of the
Ramblers last Sunday, as he wandered through the glen, bemoaning
the disappearance of the old woodland favorites, which Flora had
cherished and cultivated in this sequestered spot ever since the
Red Man dwelt within the grove. The wintergreen plant, once so
common here, is almost extinct. [Note: Wintergreen was still to be
found in the Ravine as recently as the 1950s.] [In the south] we
...passed through meadows watered by the sprightly little Goffle
Brook, until we came to the beginning of the enchanted delI which
goes by the name of Deep-Brook GIen. Here the Ramblers were met by
Mr. Van Blarcum, who welcomed them and gave them full permission to
wander over his own grounds…. In this way the Ramblers went
on until the end of the ravine was reached. Here the woodland path
gives place to the public highway [Grandview Avenue ]. Boy Scout
excursions have searched for—and found—arrowheads in
the ravine. For many long-time residents of Wyckoff, it was the
site where many summer afternoons were spent. After a heavy rain,
the sight and sound of the huge flood of water that runs through
the ravine is spectacular. The ravine is truly one of North
Jersey’s greatest sites,(some say it is) rivaled only by
Paterson’s Great Falls, and it has brought both joy and awe
to the faces of (those) who seen it. We have squandered much of
this natural wonder, which is why, now more than ever, it is
important to protect what remains for future generations to enjoy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




UPDATE: DO NOT APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHSIDE OF
THE RAVINE AS YOU WILL BE TRESSPASSING AND CAN RISK LIFE OR LIMB!!!
 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Don't cross the water when in the ravine. Do not tresspass. Nice
place to take photographs is the bridge that you will walk past if
you park at waypoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see the signs to the right to not enter
there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Largest tree N-side of ravine.  On the ravine side of the tree is a single rock that looks really out of place next to the roots. You will be at a location that you can not be seen from the road but actually not in the Raveine.  At that point you may lichen to move the rock.

The Highlands Trail is a project that seeks to preserve hiking recreational opportunities and preserve habitat and water resources along a broad band of foothill and watershed systems linking the
 Hudson River from north of Bear Mountain, southwest across Sussex, Passaic, Morris and Hunterdon Counties to the Delaware River in Riegelsville, NJ.
 When complete, the trail will link the full distance of the Highlands from end to end, a 150 mile footpath network for the more than 1.1 million acres of this distinct physiographic province. It will be possible one day, within the Highlands Trail network, to
 hike from almost any park or forest in the region to another.
 
This cache is located just under 1 mile north of Camp Jefferson which offers parking on Weldon road. Take the camp Jefferson trail which links to the HT at Mahlon Dickerson park. There is also a trail which runs along the powerlines to access this cache.

&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Dr. Sir: I have the pleasure to inform your
Excellency, that the measures concerted for quelling the mutiny in
the Jersey line were this morning carried into full execution. The
mutineers were unexpectedly surrounded and awed into an
unconditional surrender with little hesitation and no resistance.
Two of the principal actors were executed on the&lt;br/&gt;
spot, the rest pardonned. The spirit of mutiny seems now to have
completely subsided and to have given place to a genuine
repentance. This was very far from being the case previous to this
step, notwithstanding the apparent submission which the assurances
of redress had produced; they still continued insolent and
refractory and disobedient to the commands of
theirofficers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;A general pardon was promised by Colonel
Dayton, on condition of an immediate and full return to duty. This
condition was not performed on the part of the mutineers and of
course they were not entitled to the benefit of the promise;
besides which the existence of the Army called for an example. I
have the honor etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To General
Robert Howe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &quot;Sir: You are to take the command of the detachment, which
has been ordered to march from this post against the mutineers of
the Jersey line. You will rendezvous the whole of your command at
Ringwood or Pompton as you find best from circumstances. The object
of your detachment is to compel the mutineers to unconditional
submission, and I am to desire you will grant no terms while they
are with arms in their hands in a state of resistance. The manner
of executing this I leave to your discretion according to
circumstances. If you succeed in compelling the revolted troops to
a surrender you will instantly execute a few of the most active and
most incendiary leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will endeavour to collect such of the Jersey troops to your
standard as have not followed the pernicious example of their
associates, and you will also try to avail yourself of the services
of the Militia, representing to them how dangerous to civil liberty
the precedent is of armed soldiers dictating terms to their
country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You will open a
correspondence with Colonels Dayton and Shreve of the Jersey line
and Col Freelinghousen of the Militia or any
others.&quot;
&lt;br/&gt;
-- G.
Washington&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1732, Robert Howe was born in Brunswick County, North
Carolina. He emerged as the colonies’ highest-ranking officer
during the Revolutionary War. In November 1786, Howe died at his
home in Brunswick County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His military career began in 1754, when appointed Captain of the
Bladen County militia. In 1756, Howe was appointed Justice of the
Peace and was elected to represent Bladen County in the General
Assembly from 1760 to 1775.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the General Assembly, Howe and Royal Governor William
Tryon established a friendship. In 1761, Tryon appointed Howe to
the Supreme Court for the Wilmington District, and in 1766, to the
Court of Exchequer. From 1765 to 1767 and from 1769 to 1773, Howe
commanded Fort Johnston. During the 1760s, Governor Tryon called on
Howe and his Fort Johnston troops to put down the Regulator
Rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1770s, Royal Governor Josiah Martin and Howe
frequently disagreed. In 1771, Martin replaced Governor Tryon and
shortly afterward removed Howe from the Court of Exchequer; in
1773, he relinquished Howe of command of Fort Johnston. The
attachment clause controversy further divided Howe and Martin. The
provincial government deplored the attachment clause, which allowed
creditors to “attach property owned in North Carolina by
non-residents . . . to satisfy their debts.” Governor Martin
supported the decision to remove the clause, but colonial lawmakers
were determined to keep the law intact. While leading the movement
to keep the attachment clause, Howe associated with the Sons of
Liberty and the American struggle for independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s General Assembly met in 1773 and established a
Committee of Correspondence. Howe was one of nine committee members
assigned to investigate Parliamentary Acts that “may relate to or
effect the British Colonies in America.” The Committee reported
their findings to all colonies and united the fight for America’s
freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1775, Howe trained the Brunswick County militia, received a
colonel’s appointment, and assumed command of the Second North
Carolina Continentals. Howe led his 428 officers and men to
Norfolk, Virginia to reinforce Colonel William Woodford’s army,
then battling Lord Dunmore. He assumed command of the American
troops and defeated Lord Dunmore. Although Howe had proved his
military prowess, the Second North Carolina Regiment disbanded
shortly after the battle in Norfolk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Howe was appointed military advisor for North
Carolina’s Provincial Congress. In 1777, he led North Carolina
troops to meet Major General Charles Lee, commander of the Southern
Department. Now a major general, Howe was the highest ranking North
Carolinian in the Continental Army. When General Lee left the
Southern Department, James Moore assumed command. However, in the
spring of 1777, Moore was ordered to North Carolina and Howe became
Commander of the Southern Department and the highest-ranking
officer in the South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Commander of the Southern Department, Howe was to defend the
southern colonies. In the summer of 1778, Howe led the Continentals
to the Georgia-Florida border to attack the British troops at St.
Augustine, Florida. Fearing defeat, Howe urged Congress to abandon
the campaign. But Congress persisted. After several months of
chasing the British, Howe retreated northward. The campaign in
Florida was disastrous for Howe. His inability to unify command
undermined American ability to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howe’s reputation was tarnished by his defeat in Florida, so he
desperately wanted to prove his worth. He led the troops of the
Southern Department to defend Savannah, Georgia. Howe lost the city
in December 1778, however, after a surprise attack by
Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell. Soon after, all of Georgia
fell to the British and Howe was relieved as commander of the
Southern Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1779, Howe served with General George Washington on
the Hudson, commanded troops protecting the Connecticut border at
Ridgefield, and in 1780, commanded Fort West Point. Although
Congress appointed him in 1785 as part of a commission to negotiate
the land in Ohio with western Indians, Howe returned to North
Carolina, where the General Assembly passed a resolution thanking
him for his devotion to the state. In hopes of gaining a state
legislative seat, Howe campaigned in Brunswick County, but in
November 1786, he suffered a fever and died.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Col. Israel Shreve: 
&lt;p&gt;

&quot;Dr. Sir: With not less pain than you communicate it, I receive the
information contained in your letter of yesterday. This affair, if
possible, must be brought to an issue favourable to subordination,
or the army is ruined. I shall therefore immediately march a
detachment from these posts to quell the mutineers. Col
Freelinghuyssen will impart to you what I have written to him. In
addition to that, I am to desire you will endeavour to collect all
those of your regiments who have had virtue enough to resist the
pernicious example of their associates. If the revolt has not
become general, and if you have force enough to do it, I wish you
to compel the mutineers to unconditional submission. The more
decisively you are able to act the better. I am

Dear General
Washington,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is with pain that I inform Your Excellency
that the troops at this place revolted this evening, and have
marched towards Trenton: their behavior and demands are similar to
those of the Pennsylvania Line; though no blood has been spilt. I
was informed by a woman of their intentions, late this afternoon,
and immediately ordered all the men off duty to be paraded; with an
intention to detach them in different parties for the night; but
found but very few that would turn out. I was amongst them for some
time but could not prevail upon them to desist. They have lately
received a part of the depreciation of their pay, and most of them
are much disguised with liquor. Col. Frelinghauyen, one of the
Commissioners of the State is now here.&quot; --&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This eyewitness account is from the diary of James Thacher,
M.D., a surgeon in the Continental Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 March on the (January 27th,
1781) at one o'clock, a.m., eight miles, which brought us in view
of the insurgent soldiers at dawn of day. Here we halted for an
hour to make the necessary preparations. Some of our soldiers
suffered much anxiety lest the soldiers would not prove faithful on
this trying occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders were given to
load their arms - they obeyed with alacrity, and
indications were given that they were to be relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being paraded in a
line, General Howe harangued them, representing the heinousness of
the crime of mutiny, and the absolute necessity of military
subordination, adding that the mutineers must be brought to terms
of compromise, while in a state of resistance. Two fieldpieces were
ordered to be placed in view of the insurgents, and the troops were
ordered to surround the huts on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Howe then
ordered his aide-de-camp to command the mutineers to appear on
parade in front of their huts unarmed, within five minutes;
observing them to hesitate, a second messenger was sent, and they
instantly obeyed the command, and they paraded in line without arms
being in number between two and three hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding themselves
closely encircled and unable to resist, they quietly submitted to
the fate which awaited them. General Howe ordered that three of the
ringleaders should be selected as victims for condign punishment.
These unfortunate culprits were tried on the spot. Colonel Sprout
being president of the court martial, standing on the snow, and
they were ordered to be immediately shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most
guilty mutineers were next selected to be their executioners. This
was a most painful task; and when ordered to load, some of them
shed tears. The wretched victims, overwhelmed by the terrors of
death, had neither time nor power to implore the mercy and
forgiveness of their God, and such was their agonizing condition,
that no heart could refrain from emotion of sympathy and
compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first that
suffered was a sergeant (David Gilmore) and an old offender; he was
led a few yards distance and place on his knees; six of the
executioners, at a signal given by an officer, fired, three aiming
at the head and three at the breast, the other six reserving their
fire in order to dispatch the victim should the first fire fail. It
so happened in this instance; the remaining six then fired and life
was instantly extinguished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second criminal
was, by the first fire, instantly sent into eternity. The third,
being less criminal, by the recommendation of his officers, to his
unspeakable joy, received a pardon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tragical scene
produced a dreadful and salutary effect on the minds of the guilty
soldiers. Never were men more completely humbled and penitent;
tears of sorrow and of joy rushed from their eyes, and each seemed
to congratulate himself that his forfeited life had been
spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then commanded
them to ask pardon of their officers, and promise to devote
themselves to the faithful discharge of their duties as soldiers in
future. It is most painful to reflect, that circumstances should
imperiously demand the infliction of capital punishment on soldiers
who have more than a shadow of plea to extenuate their crime. These
unfortunate men have long suffered many serious grievances which
them have sustained with commendable patience; but have, at length
lost their faith in public justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of the
Pennsylvania insurgents undoubtedly encourage them to hope for
exemption from punishment. But the very existence of an army
depends on proper discipline and subordination. The arm of
authority must be exerted, and public examples be exhibited to
deter from the commission of crimes. The spirit of revolt must be
effectually repressed, or a total annihilation of the army is
inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir Henry Clinton,
on this occasion, had his hopes again excited; ever ready to profit
by treachery or revolt, he dispatched an emissary to encourage the
insurrection and to make the most tempting offers to induce the
mutineers to desert, and join the British standard; but the
messenger himself frustrated his hopes by delivering the papers to
our own
officers.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Chirp cache. Drive to the parking lot. If you do not
have &quot;chirp&quot; capabilities, please contact me for an alternate
puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CHIRP compatible device is needed for this cache. The cache is
not at the icon location but a walk around this location with a
CHIRP enabled device will soon pick up the final coordinates. Not
all GPSs can find this cache; only Garmins and only Garmin Dakota
20, GPSMAP62’s, GPSMAP78’s, Oregon 300-550’s. If
you don't have one of the listed GPS units, soon the iphone will
have an APP that can pick up it's signal. If you do have the
correct Garmin, make sure it is updated using the Garmin web
Updater online. Once updated, set it up to receive Chirps under the
geocaching program. Please don't look for the chirp, it is not
meant to be found. If you do find it...it will do you no good. It
can only be programed by the GPS which initially programmed it and
is useless to anyone else. You can read up on the Chirp by going
online to Garmin's website and searching for Chirps. Happy caching
and good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2JJCE - GC2JJCE Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TH2JJCE - Red Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 01.077 W 074° 44.237</groundspeak:long_description>

I asked the CO &quot;what is this opencache things and he gave me a nice introductory of of it.
Than he refused just give direction (i guess this is how it is to be done) but helped me out with the coordinate, if i register after on the site.
Took sometime, but here it is now.
And i was the first to sign the log too. So first opencache with the FTF.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maybe Goldilocks

&lt;b&gt;What mystical powers

magical when someone wants to prove a point they say: “Does a
bear sit in the woods?” and then everyone laughs and that is
the end of the conversation.  &lt;br/&gt;

The cliff that it is perched on looks out over several hundred acres of lake, marsh and wild wetlands.  There is a rough hewn half log bench at the top and the views are very nice.  I have been to this park many times over the years and have only seen about 3 other people.  Given that very few people visit here it provides some nice solitude and a great overlook.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The &quot;Ghost of Muskshaw&quot;  was like looking for a ghost! It was very clever and so well hidden, we gave up after 30 minutes. We came back on our way out, and  after searcing for the other OC in the preserve.  We perservered and it paid off!. It was one of the best caches I have found in a long time. The CO deserves a well done!

There are so many beautiful locations in the Muckshaw Preserve, from cool lake vistas, nice woodland areas, and lots rocky outcrops. The trails are all very nice and well maintained .  

We were very surprised to find a blank log book, A Co- FTF, was a real bonus. 

The &quot;bonus&quot; cache hike took us to some equally interesting areas of the preserve too, it took alot of searching too, with a lot of cool large boulders and many areas to hide a cache.

TFTC It was an enjoyable cache outing!

&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Graupel (also called snow pellets) refers to precipitation that
forms when supercooled droplets of water condense on a snowflake,
forming a 2–5 mm ball of rime ice; the snowflake acts as a nucleus
of condensation in this process. The term is derived from
German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under some atmospheric conditions, forming and descending snow
crystals may encounter and pass through atmospheric supercooled
cloud droplets. These droplets, which have a diameter of about 10
µm, can exist in the unfrozen state down to temperatures near
-40°C. Contact between the snow crystal and the supercooled
droplets results in freezing of the liquid droplets onto the
surface of the crystals. This process of crystal growth is known as
accretion and may happen in the clouds or when there is freezing
fog. Crystals that exhibit frozen droplets on their surfaces are
referred to as rimed. When this process continues so that the shape
of the original snow crystal is no longer identifiable, the
resulting crystal is referred to as graupel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
The series is based on the 1951 International Commission on Snow
and Ice classification system. The commission produced a fairly
simple and widely used classification system for solid
precipitation. This system defines the seven principal snow crystal
types as plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, spatial
dendrites, capped columns, and irregular forms. To these are added
three additional types of frozen precipitation: graupel, ice
pellets, and hail. The classification is the least complicated in a
series of snow classification systems. The most complex
classification scheme, an extension of Ukichiro Nakaya's work, was
published by meteorologists C. Magono and C. W. Lee in 1966. Their
system included 80 different snow crystal types. Twenty years ago I
used the international classification in an Independent Physics
Field Study where I observed snowflakes for the winter and
developed correlations with surface and lower atmospheric
conditions. Today, the classification system is used here to find
structures in nature that look similar to the snow referenced in
the cache name.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK185FZ - southern approach parking area&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 02.077 W 074° 17.123&lt;br/&gt;Park here.  Look for indian heads and follow red triangle trail up the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

We followed the yellow trail from &quot;Ghost of Muskshaw&quot; around the lake .  There were a few wet spots but nothing too serious.  The cache location is close to the junction of the red, blue and yellow trails which helps if you have a trail map.  
The cache was very well hidden and we searched for quite a while. Honestly, I was ready to quit when something caught my eye and we made the find.  The &quot;chirp&quot; is still active and it beamed the location of the &quot;bonus&quot; cache.  Soon were were off to grab it.  We did get that also.  
Once again, Old Navy and I were quite surprised to find a completely blank log book.  So, it was a FTF, almost 12 months after the cache was placed

After about 20 minutes of hard searching, so many spots in the rocks, and the fall leaves made it difficult. But we did not want to give up!  We were just  ready to quit when  Al, spotted something that turned out to be old beer, but the cache was there too!. Then we realized the  &quot;chirp&quot; is still active  we were able to get the location of the &quot;bonus&quot; cache.

&lt;p&gt;Stellar crystals are born at temperatures near -15 degrees C,
and are among the most common type of snowflakes. They are as
delicate as they look because large flakes tend to become broken by
wind and midair collisions with other crystals. Under ideal
conditions several stars my join to form large snowflakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
The series is based on the 1951 International Commission on Snow
and Ice classification system. The commission produced a fairly
simple and widely used classification system for solid
precipitation. This system defines the seven principal snow crystal
types as plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, spatial
dendrites, capped columns, and irregular forms. To these are added
three additional types of frozen precipitation: graupel, ice
pellets, and hail. The classification is the least complicated in a
series of snow classification systems. The most complex
classification scheme, an extension of Ukichiro Nakaya's work, was
published by meteorologists C. Magono and C. W. Lee in 1966. Their
system included 80 different snow crystal types. Twenty years ago I
used the international classification in an Independent Physics
Field Study where I observed snowflakes for the winter and
developed correlations with surface and lower atmospheric
conditions. Today, the classification system is used here to find
structures in nature that look similar to the snow referenced in
the cache name. However, this cache is placed with a stellar
view.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;00185GC - southern approach parking area&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 02.077 W 074° 17.123&lt;br/&gt;Park here.  Look for indian heads and follow red triangle trail until it intersects with orange trail going north.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The most common snow crystals by far are the irregular crystals.
These are small, usually clumped together, and show little of the
symmetry seen in stellar or columnar crystals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This cache is at the trailhead which
leads to a hilly forest that is a sanctuary for wildlife. Hikers
and mountain bikers enjoy miles of challenging trails. Many trails
offer a view of the New York City skyline. Birdwatchers are
attracted to the forest for its ponds, streams and marshes that
provide the perfect habitat for bird and other wildlife species.
The forest borders the Ramapo Mountain Reservation, which is part
of the Bergen County Park System.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;br/&gt; 



&lt;strong&gt;Ramapo Lake Natural Area&lt;/strong&gt;
(1,417 acres)
&lt;p&gt;This natural area offers spectacular views from
numerous rock outcroppings and ledges and rewards those who accept
the challenge of the winding hiking trails and rocky terrain that
comprise most of the site. A 120-acre clearwater mountain lake
provides an excellent spot for fishing and birdwatching. There is
no swimming permitted in this lake. The area is open every day from
8 am to 8 pm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;Trails&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system of marked hiking and multi use trails
are available for the public to explore. These trails offer
visitors opportunities to hike interior woodlands and rocky
vistas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The multi use trails are suitable for hiking, mountain biking, and
cross country skiing. Please obey all designated uses of the
trails, posted at the trail heads and trail crossings. For
information on mountain biking and volunteer opportunities please
visit the Ramapo
Valley Cycling Club Web site.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Please note that trail difficulty ratings are opinion only. All
trail mileages represent only the portion of the trail that goes
through Ramapo Mountain State Forest, and complete trail lengths
could be longer, therefore a topgraphical trail map is recommended
for navigation of the trails. Maps may be purchased in the office
(973-962-7031) o Ringwood
State Parkr through the New York - New Jersey Trail
Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In American usage, sleet is a form of precipitation consisting
of frozen raindrops or refrozen partially melted snowflakes, also
known as ice pellets. In order for the snow flakes to significantly
melt, the temperature aloft needs to rise a few degrees Celsius
above the melting point. However, if the subfreezing layer below
the warm layer is too narrow, freezing rain will be the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the temperature and moisture
concentrations the various types of snowflakes for at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is based on the 1951 International Commission on Snow
and Ice classification system. The commission produced a fairly
simple and widely used classification system for solid
precipitation. This system defines the seven principal snow crystal
types as plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, spatial
dendrites, capped columns, and irregular forms. To these are added
three additional types of frozen precipitation: graupel, ice
pellets, and hail. The classification is the least complicated in a
series of snow classification systems. The most complex
classification scheme, an extension of Ukichiro Nakaya's work, was
published by meteorologists C. Magono and C. W. Lee in 1966. Their
system included 80 different snow crystal types. Twenty years ago I
used the international classification in an Independent Physics
Field Study where I observed snowflakes for the winter and
developed correlations with surface and lower atmospheric
conditions. Today, the classification system is used here to find
structures in nature that look similar to the snow referenced in
the cache name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;00186X6 - Parking and NYNJ Trailhead (not the closest)&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 03.255 W 074° 15.797&lt;br/&gt;Designated and LEGAL! parking for Blue Trail Head.

I was hiking up the blue trail for some of the new caches in the park when I saw an interesting piece of equipment in the woods. 

There are lots of gauges, wires and pipes around this abandoned and rusting machine.  Maybe it was there to pump water to the snow blowing equipment on the ski slope.  Who knows?  

Now it is the home for a MKH which is about 2 feet off the ground and plainy visible from the right angle.</groundspeak:long_description>

I wanted to stretch my legs on this fine February morning.  This was a great cache to start the hike in 6&quot; of powder.  Despite the snow this was an easy find.

Wjgrun’s matches were reported lost and we had to find them.  But, we suspected that our good friend and stellar cacher, Weathernowcast, had taken the matches and hidden them to keep Wjgrun from smoking.  So, it was our mission to find those matches and make sure that they were safely hidden.

Yes, we found the matches.  But, imagine our surprise when we found that Wjgrun had a secret ashtray.  It had to be moved.  So, we took the ashtray and placed it on a bookshelf elsewhere in the park.

Can you please find Wjgrun’s ashtray and make sure that it is safely hidden?.  



NOTE:
Norvin Green State Forest is teeming with wildlife: deer, bears, snakes, small animals and ticks.  The trails are well marked but some of the slopes and rocks can be challenging.  Please use care and be aware of your surroundings.  

Good caching…..</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This
     truely
     is a
     
special
place,
nestled in the center of Newark's 35,000-acre
Pequannock
Watershed, one of
New Jersey's few remaining relatively unspoiled wildernesses, yet
only 40 miles from
New
York
City.

The cache is placed on a cozy little overlook
with inch deep moss whih should make the search all the more
rewarding on tired feet.  The moss covered exposed
bedrock would be a nice place to sit back and
relax a bit or a soft spot for
bears.  
A visit here in any season
will be rewarding. The trails are so empty that you will likely see
more bear then hikers and
sounderused that the moss
underfoot softens your step on much of your
path. There is always something of interest for every
outdoors person. Winter, with its spectacle of ice and snow, is a
photographer's delight. Winter finches (pine siskins,
crossbills, redpolls, and
grosbeaks) in flight years often frequent the many conifers that
dot the landscape. During these frigid months that feature colors
of white and brown, a botanist is not at a loss to find something
green, since lichens, mosses, club mosses, and evergreen
ferns
abound.&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;March heralds the end of
winter and the hope of spring. The sight of skunk
cabbage peaking through the soil is the first sign of
the season. The vanguard of the passerine bird movement north is
the eastern phoebe proudly
announcing itself along
Clinton Road's many streams. Warmer days
feature Compton tortoise shell and
mourning cloak
butterflies as well as stone flies dotting the many
rocks and bridges. Clinton Reservoir, when not frozen, serves as an
excellent stop-off spot for ducks and loons on their journey north.
Coltsfoot wins the award for the first flower of the season,
blooming in late March or early April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting
snow provides copious quantities of that precious clear
liquid that supplies the many streams welcoming the Louisiana
Waterthrushes back in April. Cinnamon and sensitive
ferns almost blanket the moist areas, where
salamanders can be found with
some searching. Kinglets and yellow-rumped warblers are plentiful
as they wend their way north. May and June are the months most
folks look forward to for wildflowers, spring migration, and,
ultimately, the breeding season (for birds).&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;gt;The breeding season is
something special here--over 140 species have been recorded in the
&quot;watershed&quot; on various surveys taken over the last 20 years.
Clinton road alone has registered 25 species of warblers in June
and early July. Nesting
raptors are also a specialty of the area.
Owls include Great-horned, barred, and
saw-whet , and hawks include goshawk, broad-winged, and
red-shouldered (the best location in New Jersey for this declining
species).&lt;br/&gt;
Summer is the season to

explore the
many trails that
find their origin along Clinton Road,
where with luck, mammals such
asblack
bear, river otter, beaver, porcupine, and
red and
gray
foxes may be found.
But beware, timber
rattlesnakes have are also present in the
areas.  A visit here is most pleasant at this time of
the year, with mountain laurel blanketing the landscape and
assorted berries to provide a fine dessert for a picnic lunch.
Thirty-five species of ferns bring joy to &quot;fernatic's&quot; hearts, and
the abundant wildflowers are ample fodder for any nature
photographer. &amp;lt;/&amp;gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Autumn,
with its brilliant displays of changing foliage, renders
this &lt;i&gt;the place to
be&lt;/i&gt;, especially during
mid-October, but a visit anytime is worthwhile. To truly enjoy the
experience of Clinton Road, take a closer look.

Buy a permit and parking sticker and find out
why many of this state'sfinest
naturalists consider this one of their favorite haunts
and why this area must be preserved for future
enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After seeing 5 bears yesterday and having the trail blocked by a sixth bear I returned for more photographic opportunities and to find a few caches.  This was a great hiding spot but I had to sign the log with a stick as my pen had run try and their was not a writing utensil in the cache. This lonely cache was in fine shape.  Thanks for placing it so close to the trail.</groundspeak:text>

from Stephens Road north to the Bearfort Mountain cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike was about 1.3 miles along
a beautiful old woods road with very little terrain
change&lt;/p&gt;
  There were many picturesque
locations and several great places to stash a cache.  I
wondered why the the Bearfort Cache had not been found in 10 months
or so.  I thought that adding a cache or two to the area would
help to bring some cachers to this area.
&lt;p&gt;As I walked, I saw the &quot;Three
Sisters&quot; and I remembered a famous Three Sisters Restaurant in
Georgia.  I thought about the Three Sisters Stables which is
near where I live, and I was inspired to put a cache
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy.  Just a feet
off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is at P8 at the gate on
Stephens Road.  Just a short hike (uphill) until you reach the
blue trail.  The terrain rating is based on the uphill walk,
otherwise the cache would be rated at 2.0 x 1.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2W266 - Parking at P8&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 06.432 W 074° 24.458</groundspeak:long_description>

I returned today after experiencing a lot of bears yesterday. 


This cache reminded me about a French film about three sisters.  One was round, one was square and the other was a bit peculiar.  This one turned out that I was able to make the find quickly.  By this time of my hike all writing utensils were not working so I signed the log with a stick (that works well by the way).

Thanks Al for placing a cache out here.  The Mountain Laurel are at their peak!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Source Mike Schwartz Nov 1993  at(http://cohp.org/nj/new_jersey.html#Passaic)

There are 6 points around Terrace Pond that are &amp;gt; 1480 feet above m.s.l.  Over the years one or another have been considered the Passaic County High Point.  Currently, many consider all six tied for the honor and all six are higher then the official &quot;benchmark&quot; to the east of Terrace Pond.


Of the six this one is the easiest to reach and is located close to two other &quot;high points.&quot;

Take the white trail south along the west side of the pond (not the longer route along the east side), and bear uphill to the right on the signed red trail. When this trail crests and is clearly starting downhill, bushwhack generally north along the ridge line. Almost immediately reach a clump of at least three knobs, the highest of which is the southernmost of three highpoints. Look for a cairn about 50 feet to the Northeast of the cache.  The highest point on this outcropping is located at (41° 8.212' N, 74° 23.865' W.


For extra credit (but no caches as the 528 rule applies to the multi that starts north of here)the another high point can be found 162 feet to the north of the cache at (41° 8.234' N, 74° 23.872' W) Continue almost due north to another knob topped by a nice, sit-down-for-lunch-sized boulder, with a cairn nearby


When you are done having lunch checkout the third nob in the area at 167 feet to the northeast of the cache at  (41° 8.233' N, 74° 23.847' W): Backtrack to the southernmost point and strike a little north of east to the tiny easternmost point. You will have passed this point on the way uphill, but it's not obvious. Look for an orange blaze on top and a grand view east to the New York City skyline, some 45 miles away, haze permitting. 

If you want to put caches on the other three high points in the Passaic County which are located north of Terrace Pond:  GOOD LUCK!! as there are no trails near them.

No snow on southside of hill.

Took yellow trail.  No one had walked on it since the snow from several weeks ago. No tracks on the trail is always fun.

Got to the cache.  What a great spot!! Nice view. Cool erratic and a great cache full of stuff.

Out hiding 4 caches today on th theory giving is better than receiving.

Happy New Year Kane!!!

I visited the spectacular views at Black Rock just above this boulder field (you can see black rock above your through the trees.)  I spooked a bear on the way to explore this boulder field.  The cache is hidden in a little shelter on the west side of one of the largest boulders in the area.

For the northern approach park at the Blue Lake parking area on Long Meadow Rd. The approach from the south can be from Long Pond Ironworks or Ringwood Manor SP.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Certainly TRL's most ambitious cache placement to date, for the
Stokes State Forest Petroglyph Trail Challenge involves a
substantial hike and climb as you progress from the initial stage
to the final cache location. For the most part, you can follow the
excellent trail system for the entire hike. Grab a trail map on
your way into the Park and then aim for the parking near Stony
Lake. The Swenson and Tinsley Trails are your friends and while you
are on them the terrain rating is the three noted above. The last
0.6 miles pops the rating a bit to 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, your challenge begins looking for
petroglyphs - pictures carved onto small to medium sized rocks.
These will be hidden as you might expect a cache to be hidden to
reduce the chance they will be muggled. Except for Stage 4 which is
grey, all the rocks are red-brown in color (stage 1 - pictured). On
the back side of the rock, will be the coordinates to the next
location. Please place it back exactly as you found it. NOTE: If it
is wet or snow is on the ground, this becomes a 5/4 as moisture
makes the petroglyphs all but disappear and some of the final 0.6
mile hike potentially treacherous. In 2008, TRL backed up every
location so that there are two elements with coordinates for you to
look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is a large ammo can. It contained a few TRL
Bearbait coins at launch and there was a special prize for the FTF.
Once you have found the cache, we would recommend that you continue
to N41 13.125; W074 43.102 which is one of the most spectacular
views in New Jersey. It requires about another 200' climb and 0.3
mile hike but it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please plan for your hike. Know the weather conditions before
you embark, leave sufficient times to rest, grab a snack, sightsee
and return before daylight fades. Know that in Stokes State Forest
hunting is permitted so when in season wear orange. Also be aware
that there are bears and other wildlife to watch for - know how to
respond in case you have an encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#1930Wow,  it turned into a long day.  Kevin, I really enjoyed the cache and all the work you put into it. I spent a good deal of time at each stage looking for and finding various quantities of original petroglyphs, new wood carving glyps and several of the alternative information holders.  I will be returning to stage 5 to place a new glyph.The trail was easy and the 800 foot gain was accomplished over 3.5 miles so it was largely unnoticed.  After spending so much time alone on the trails, I was sorta overwhelmed with people at the overlook.  I was expecting a little more privacy.The views were amazing and amounted to 300 degree viewsI really appreciated the unique effort for this cache.  I feel very happy to have completed it.  I was thrilled to have found some of your original artwork.  I am honored for you to allow me to adopt this cache.  </groundspeak:text>

I will be hiking the cache route on Saturday.  If TRL contacts me and tells me to pick everything up, I will.  Otherwise I plan on signing the log and adopting it afterwards.

As you look for this cache, please take an opportunity to reflect upon the many lives lost to evil men across the world and honor their memories. Also think about just how wonderful our country is that we have the freedom to enjoy something like geocaching which brings so many of us so much joy.

This cache is not within the proper footprint of the memorial. Please treat the location with the respect it deserves.

The container is a camouflaged key holder hidden on the bridge.

WARNING:  There is a small parking area on the southbound side of Mountain Lodge Road, the same side as the cache.  Please be careful of traffic while looking for this cache, especially if you bring children.  Also, there is a steep drop into the stream.
There is no reason to get too close to the edge or stand in the roadway.

Lastly, be careful of the Balrog!</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is located near the 4th vertex. You have&lt;br/&gt;to calculate the position of the missing vertex before you go out&lt;br/&gt;looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you calculate the Vertex points you may realize there is&lt;br/&gt;more than one. In fact there are three vertex points, each a&lt;br/&gt;possible cache location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you could travel to all three locations &amp; scour the&lt;br/&gt;areas, there is a much easier way. You need to compute the centroid&lt;br/&gt;of the triangle that all 3 Vertex points form. At that centroid&lt;br/&gt;point, there is a sign that will give you the information needed to&lt;br/&gt;find the correct vertex point as well as the projection info from&lt;br/&gt;that Vertex point to the final cache location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this brings back some geometry memories!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Info obtained from Centroid point for Projection:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance= .abc km&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degrees= c.ad*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;a= Number of letters in 3rd word&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;b= Number of letters in 2nd word&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;c= Rule # that starts with letter &quot;P&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;d= Number of letters in month listed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sake of the cache, the Vertex Points are labeled 1-3 with&lt;br/&gt;the one located farthest West as 1, next one East is 2, the&lt;br/&gt;farthest East one is 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going back to the sign at the Centroid point:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache Vertex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule # that begins with the letter &quot;N&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No need to visit the Vertex site to make the final projection&lt;br/&gt;needed..though it is close by!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;br/&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changed it for a fuzzy + - 100 ft due to the nature of this puzzle&lt;br/&gt;and how you found the vertex &amp; did the projection.

Horseshoe area of John Boyd Thacher State Park.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Horseshoe is an awesome area of the park on the top of a
large spur of the escarpment. The ledge trail runs around the edge
of the escarpment offering fantastic views at many vantage
points.&lt;br/&gt;
 There is a wooden fence to protect visitors from falling so please
do not cross the fence for any reason! It's not only illegal, it's
extremely dangerous and needless yet folks do it every year and
often pay the price with their lives.&lt;br/&gt;
 This cache is located within 25ft of the trail on the inside of
the horseshoe.&lt;br/&gt;
 Please stay on the trail until you are very close. If you reach
the old remains of a picnic table and grill you have gone in too
far.....turn around and head back towards the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 So enjoy the cache, amazing views and have fun and be safe!&lt;br/&gt;

Cave area, you'll find several other trails, some marked and some
not marked, heading off to other areas. Some of these less traveled
trails eventually connect again to main trails and this is one of
them.


 Diddly and I explored several of these side trails and found some
interesting areas. I hope you take the time to do likewise and

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Cdparker1’s 200th cache&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2ooth was meant to have been done by the end of 2008.  Time conspired against me and this cache did not come to be until March of 2009.  That’s ok, though, as it does follow the path of my 100th cache in that I hid it with my parents.  If we had the time and containers, I could have hid #201-#205 but those will have to wait.  &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sawyer Mountain hike is just over two miles roundtrip with a 630 ft ascent.  It is probably one of the easier/easiest hikes in the Adirondacks with a nice view from the top.  Although the top is wooded, there are two ledges that offer a nice view.   The first is before the summit and the second is actually past the summit.  For the latter, just continue to follow the yellow markers.  You will know when you are there.  From this point you will have to bushwhack to the final.  &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to locate the final you will need to project a waypoint from the waypoint given to you at the initial point. So, once you locate the set of coordinates, project a waypoint 171.4° for a distance of 855'. This will take you to the final destination.


&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: You, and all members of your party must read and agree to the www.geocaching.com disclaimer. In addition, you all must agree to hold the cache owner, www.opencaching.com and the landowners harmless from any and all causes for action. You and all other members of your party must individually and collectively determine your/their physical fitness and outdoors/hiking skill levels, decide whether or not to visit the various cache locations, and whether or not it is safe and prudent to do so under the conditions that will be encountered. Cache seekers assume all risks involved in seeking these cache locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People that do not wish to do a cache because of any danger they might perceive to be present is certainly within their right to not proceed. However you do not have the right to try to ruin the enjoyment of others in attempting a find that is beyond your capabilities, but not beyond theirs. This goes for almost every caching event there is. After all one might run into spiders, snakes, poisonous plants, trips and falls and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety First! .......Take a friend, Look out for others, take a cell phone if possible, watch where you're stepping, NEVER UNCOVER ANY CACHE WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET, USE A STICK! If you feel uncomfortable in doing a cache, for any reason, just walk away!!!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Beautiful Adirondack Beach

The purpose of the cache is to introduce you to Terrill Pond and the great beach at the north end of the pond. It is one of, if not the nicest beach in the Adirondack Park's 6,000,000 acres.

The cache is about a quart cylinder placed to be winter friendly. See the gallery.

The beach is about a 1/4 mile long and sandy. The depth increases very gradually so you can wade out a long way before you get chest high. It is a great place to swim or just enjoy the sun. There is a Lean To near by and several nice campsites.

The Northville Lake Placid trail from Long Lake or Lake Durant had some boot sucking mud today and the Lean To Log suggested the trails south was covered with water in places. The trail from the Blue Mountain Trail head should be better footing but has more elevation change.

If you take the cache away from the hide to do your trading and logging, please leave something behind to mark the spot so you can be sure of getting it back it the same place. Thanks and have a nice hike.
