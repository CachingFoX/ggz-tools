En su extremo occidental, sobre la autopista Norte, se encuentra la estación Virrey del sistema TransMilenio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El proyecto del desarrollo de este parque fue la creación de un parque lineal a lo largo de la quebrada de El Virrey (Río Negro) para protección y conservación de la fuente de agua, y las especies animales y vegetales de la zona, especialmente la avifauna que anida y vive en él.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El área del parque se dividió en tres grandes zonas: La primera comprendida entre Carrera Séptima y la Carrera 11. La segunda se extiende desde la Carrera 11 y la 15. Estas dos primeras zonas se caracterizan por ser un parque angosto el cual amplía su extensión en la tercera zona que se extiende desde la Carrera 15 hasta la Autopista Norte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El cache es un pequeño contenedor plàstico que cotiene un avartar y loogbook,BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The linear park and ecological corridor round The Viceroy is a park that extends from the seventh race to the North Freeway to the street level Eighty eight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park has online network of bicycle paths, pedestrian and seating areas and drinking fountains for visitors and mascotas.1 not allowed to carry out high-impact activities. At its western end, on the highway north is the station of the TransMilenio system Viceroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development project of this park was to create a linear park along the gorge of the Viceroy (Black River) to protect and conserve the water source, and animal and plant species in the area, especially the birds that nests and lives in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park area was divided into three zones: the first between Seventh Carrera and Carrera 11. The second extends from the Carrera 11 and 15. These first two areas are characterized by a narrow park which extends its length in the third zone extending from Avenue 15 to Highway North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small plastic container and loogbook cotiene a avartar, BYO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Cuando la familia Marroquín decidió vender la construcción, los nuevos compradores no pudieron habitarla. Después de esto hecho fue abandonado, y posteriormente fue alquilado primero para un cabaret y posteriormente como hospital psiquiátrico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En 1952 fue comprado por el médico cirujano y escritor Roberto Restrepo, quien lo restauró completamente. En 1970, un petrolero venezolano llamado Guillermo Villasmil, compró la propiedad y decidió remodelarla y decorarla. La dotó de piscina y habitaciones para invitados especiales y levantó un criadero de caballos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Durante la época de violencia de los carteles de drogas en Colombia (70's y 90's) el castillo perteneció a Juan Camilo Zapata Vázquez, un narcotraficante perteneciente al cartel de Medellín y socio principal de José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha (alias El Mexicano), sitio donde se encontraban para realizar fiestas y reuniones, finalmente Juan Camilo Zapata V. es dado de baja por la policía y el bien pasa a manos del estado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomado de Wikipedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El cache es un pequeño contenedor plàstico que contiene un naipe y loogbook.

According to the National Department of Statistics of Colombia, 12,852 lived in the town in 2005. Its median temperature is 26 °C. It was founded in 1895, but was not officially recognized as the seat of the region until 29 September 1908, by President Rafael Reyes. The town was originally named San Lorenzo. In 1930, the name was changed to Armero in memory of José León Armero The original seat of the region was destroyed on November 13, 1985 after an eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz Volcano that destroyed the town and killed about 23,000 people. Approximately 31,000 people lived in the area at the time. The incident became known as the While the destruction of the town made world news in its own right, the best known victim was Omayra Sánchez, a young girl who died after being trapped by water and concrete up to her neck for three days. After this event, the town of  was assigned as the seat of the municipality of Armero, rendering Armero ;The survivors were relocated to the towns of Guayabal and 128);Lérida where they received housing and money, though little was done in aiding the survivors in reconstructing their lives. In the area where the city was located, survivors created an extensive cemetery. Where each one had a house, they constructed a tomb with an epitaph. In this way, they constructed a new symbolic city called The Camposanto. Francisco González explains in his book, Epitafios, algo de historia hasta esta tarde pasando por Armero(Epitaphs, a bit of history during this afternoon, passing through Armero).

(328) Went for a walk in the woods with the Frau on a gorgeous and warm fall afternoon. This was so easy to find, I have to wonder if it was placed in the right spot based on previous cachers' comments. Replaced as found, but CO might want to make sure it in the right spot.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is nano cache hidden in a interesting spot. I ran across this area while exploring and thought placing a cache here would be fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If been researching the area and have only been able to find some limited information. There was another cache near here called Duke's Trestle. While I don't think that was the proper name of the crossing, I do know that this trestle was here for the Barnegat Branch Railroad, which was part of the Toms River Railroad. Trains from Toms River would cross Ceder Creek via the trestle on the way to the Forked River/Lacey Station and destinations further down the Barnegat Branch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you look across the river, you can see The Barnegat Branch Trail. Hopefully, at some point in the near future the link through Lacey Township will join the north part with complete section in the south. &quot;It is the County’s vision that the BBT will be more than a recreational park; rather, when complete, it will be a vital transportation corridor, as well as a valuable environmental and historical resource and an enormous asset to Ocean County residents and visitors alike&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History of the Railroad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toms River Railroad was established in 1866 with a stop at the county seat of Toms River and extended to Waretown in 1872 by the Toms River and Waretown RR Co. The Central Railroad of New Jersey purchased the line in 1881 and in 1893 the property was transferred to the Toms River &amp; Barnegat RR Co. In the mid-1950s passenger service ended, and freight service continued through the early 1970s. There are many artifact still around along the line, including the round table and coal dump in Barnegat, and the Toms River Freight Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accessing the Cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is not hidden in, around, above or under the trestle; which is clearly marked to discourage such shenanigans. But, I do encourage you to take and post pictures, and add any history regarding the area. Approach from the South, unless you want to make this a 5 star cache. Parking is available within 100ft of the cache, but some driving in sugar sand and water filled ditches might be in the way, so know the limits of your vehicle. You can always park at the ball fields in William Hebrew Park and walk it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A very small container (wallet-sized) cache, decorated in camouflage, just off the Berkeley Avenue Walking Path in Beachwood.  The only contents are a log and small pen; it can hold a small trackable.  This cache is in memory of a man named Leo who lived across the street from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you drive to this cache, please keep in mind that you cannot park on the trail side of Berkeley Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a borough with almost no sidewalks, this paved trail along Berkeley Avenue offers a nice stroll or short ride.  This path is relatively new and certainly did not exist in the late 70's and 80's when I rode my bicycle all over Beachwood and beyond.  The Berkeley Avenue Walking Path is not a rail-trail, since no railroad tracks existed at its location.  The nearby Beachwood Borough Bike Trail, on the other hand, is a 1.3-mile rail-trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;About My Neighbor Leo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in memory of my old neighbor Leo, who lived across the street from this cache.  All Leo wanted was for the dirt road in front on his house to be paved.  Leo never would have imaged a paved trail directly across the street!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leo and his wife were some of the first people we met when my family moved to Beachwood in 1976.  Back then, many streets and avenues in the rear of Beachwood were not cut through the woods yet.  The avenues which did exist were dirt roads past Birch Street.  The dirt roads included this stretch of Berkeley Avenue from Spruce Street, going past the cache, to the soccer fields.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leo was frustrated by dust clouds that emerged as cars zoomed past his house.  He tried to combat the dust by putting tar down on the road in front of his house and by placing a big sign that begged &quot;Go Slow! Dust!&quot;  Leo stuck around long enough to see the road paved.  But Leo wasn't lucky enough to see a paved trail across the street.  RIP, Leo!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'pile of rocks' is known by a few different names.  Cairn is the most common term ... but it could also be referred to as a 'trail duck' ... or in some interactive instances where you add your own rock to the pile it's a ritual known as 'isivivane'.  Cairns are generally used as a marker of some type.  In some cases they may represent some historical/memorial commemoration ... or they might just provide some decorative/artistic value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 'Pile of Rocks' is alongside the Pine Hill trail in Shark River Park (rock pile is at: 40 11.727N  074 05.452W;  cache container is at coordinates listed above for this cache).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a collection of about 15 to 20 varied sized rocks that are roughly 2 to 5 pounds each (between a few inches to 10 inches wide).  It's not clear who originally placed the rocks there but their form often changes over time via the constructive and destructive actions of hikers on this trail.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trees in these woods are of varied age and in some cases could date as old as hundred years ... but a rock ... and possibly even these rocks that make up this cairn ... are likely much older ... maybe even thousands of years old.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time I hike this trail I look forward to coming to this point to see what shape the cairn is in.  Sometimes it's still the way I last constructed it ... other times it's completely knocked down w/ the rocks strewn about.  At first I'm disappointed when I see the cairn knocked down ... and then I realize this allows me the opportunity to pile them back up again.  Once in a while it's (piled up) form is the result of someone else's creative input.  Either way it provides something of interest for each visit on the trail.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently I have been bringing a new rock to the cairn each time I hike the trail ... and add it to the collection of existing rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you visit this 'Pile of Rocks' you can either just come to see what other's have done (including those that 'destroy') ... or ideally you can be a 'creator/contributor' to the cairn by either bringing a rock of your own (isivivane) ... or just pile the rocks back up if they've been knocked down.  Plan on taking a picture of your creation if you're going to be a 'creator'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hidden cache is nearby the cairn about 100 feet south (up the hill) behind the formation and just off the faint trail leading up the hill (this faint trail is not the main trail).  It's hidden under a typical geocaching 'pile of sticks'.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come search for the cache and stop to reflect on this 'Pile of Rocks' in the woods along the way.  Add your own little piece of creativity if you're so inclined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out some of the links below to see what others have to say about piling up rocks in unique and unusual ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park either in the Gulley Rd. parking lot on Southeastern side of park ... or in the Schoolhouse Rd. parking lot in Northwestern side of park.  Take the Hidden Creek trail (blue trail) and head towards the Pine Hills trail loop in Southwestern corner of park.  The 'rock pile' and cache are just about exactly halfway around the (pine hill trail) loop at the edge of the park's southern boundry.  Trail maps on available at both trailheads mentioned ... both displayed on the board ... and copies for you to take with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related Links:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference to rocks &amp; stones in the Bible:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2858682/the_significance_of_rocks_and_stones.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ritual of Isivivane (to throw one's stone on the pile):&lt;br/&gt;There is an old tradition where every traveller who passes a certain spot would add a stone to a pile of stones. In doing this, every traveller become part of the common purpose and identifies with a certain good cause.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, I guess I'm FTF, eh? I was out checking on my own hides and assisting another cacher with a few new hides when I decided to finally take the trail all the way out to the turn around and see if I could find this one. The weather was perfect - sunny and 50 degrees and I ended up shedding my coat along the way. At the top of the hill I was able to just make out heavy equipment moving around by the reservoir. I approached from the South so I found the cache before I saw the Cairn. Took me a little while to spot the container as the camo was working overtime. I walked right by it twice. :-) Container is in good shape and dry. After re-hiding the cache as I found it I headed down the hill towards the rock pile. It's pretty much impossible to miss though I seem to have missed it when I was scouting this very area for a cache hide last year! Very cool! I had neglected to bring a rock with me but I did re-pile the shortest stack which had toppled and added pine-cones for decoration. I continued along the Pine Hills trail back to the Schoolhouse Road parking. 3 years ago I helped build this stretch of the trails with the Monmouth County Parks Trails Team. Like the cache, the trail is in good shape and dry. :-D It's good to see you back out here hiding caches. I'll definitely be reminding others that there are some good OpenCaches in our area at last. Thanks for the hike and hide! </groundspeak:text>

rapid pace of New Jersey Development.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No bushwhacking required!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache sits atop a small hill in Neptune City, NJ. This very
hill was home to the Umani and Wanami clan of the Lenni Lenape
tribe of the Algonquins. When the Dutch first started to settle the
land the natives living here referred to themselves as the Newasons
or Navasinks and their land of Neptune City as Nolletquesset. The
sandy soil wasn't very good for farming but the Shark River
provided a seemingly endless supply of fish, clams &amp; crabs to
hungry natives &amp; Europeans alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the English took control of the area &amp; this small
hill became part of Monmouth County, East New Jersey. Through the
years it was part of Shrewsbury, Ocean &amp; finally Neptune
township. Throughout most of the 1800s it was referred to as
Neptune Village until October 4th 1881 when this land was
officially incorporated as Neptune City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1851 there were only seven families living within
the borders of what would eventually become Neptune City (shown on
the map at the left). Though the roads were unlabeled they line up
well with Old Corlies (33), West Sylvania Ave, Rt 18 &amp; Rt 35.
Goose Pond is now Fletcher Lake &amp; Duck Creek is Sylvan Lake.
The black squares on the map indicate households. This quaint
little hill falls very near the third square from the left. It was
owned by &quot;S. Bennett&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land stayed in the family when most of Neptune City was
purchased in 1861 by Henry Bennett who went on to become one of New
Jersey's first Millionaires. Henry Bennett built grand hotels,
horse farms &amp; the Bijou chain of theaters, but left this small
hill untouched as a gift to his family name. It has (narrowly)
avoided destruction/development over the years &amp; today is
hidden &amp; forgotten by all save those who carry the Palmer &amp;
Bennett names. Stand atop the knoll &amp; imagine you are one of
the native Algonquins watching the Dutch &amp; English tall-ships
sail into the Shark River inlet. Jump forward two hundred years
&amp; see yourself as the one of the Bennett children remembering
Samuel, your father, who cleared the land on which you now
stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not attempt to bushwhack to this cache! Most of the
surrounding land is private property &amp; blanketed with thorns.
To visit Bennett's Hill, you should park in the new parking lot by
the Shore Medical building which can be easily accessed via Rt. 33
at the intersection of Oxford Way. There's a traffic light at this
intersection for ease of caching. The NJ Transit 836 also stops at
this corner. No fence/wall climbing or bushwhacking is necessary to
get to GZ, but the area can be dangerous thanks to the
over-aggressive development. You don't even have to leave the
clearing to find the cache. When you find it please be gentle with
the natural camo. Thanks &amp; happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

get to.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend:&lt;/b&gt; Many years ago, the Shaman of the tribe of
native Lenni Lenape had a vision. He spoke of this vision with the
tribe's Chief telling him that they must build a mound and from
this mound they will see the fate of their tribe. The Chief
gathered his people and told them of the Shaman's vision then took
up a handful of earth and carried it to the Shark River valley
where the tribe would have their ceremonies. The tribe members
followed and, one bowl full of dirt at a time, they began to create
the ceremonial mound. It took many years but the mound eventually
became a hill. It is said that from the top the Chief could hear
all of his people and see all of their lands. One day during their
morning ceremony, a young squaw looked out to the East and saw tall
ships docked along the coast. The asked the Shaman what it might
mean but the old man wasn't looking - he was listening. Then they
could all hear it - approaching hoof beats. Men were coming on
horseback, drawn by smoke from the tribe's fire. The Chief turned
to the Shaman to ask what they should do but he was not there.
Where he stood they saw a few butterflies fluttering in the wind,
being blown to the West. It was then that the tribe knew their
fate. To this day you can stand up on the hill and listen to the
&quot;hoof beats&quot; of modern man though the hill has been much eroded by
time and horsepower. While the Lenni Lanape are long gone, you will
find that the butterflies remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache:&lt;/b&gt; You are hunting
for a small round lock-n-lock camouflaged to blend in. You will
want to approach the cache from Campus Parkway near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2a3df2be-70f1-4876-aaed-66cd738f6cfe&quot;&gt;the Gateway cache&lt;/a&gt; and follow the road until it
becomes a trail. At that point, you're on your own. Only minimal
bushwhacking required. Downhill leads to the source springs of the
Shark River. Uphill leads to a smiley! Check the trail map for
details. 
Hunting is no longer allowed here but just in case you might want
to wear your orange in the Fall. This is a special place that gets
little respect from the few who visit. Practice CITO when necessary
and enjoy the hike!&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Garysaurus&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who:&lt;/b&gt; Jim Gary was a native of Central Jersey and famous
world-wide for his art. Though quite capable of more &quot;serious&quot;
pieces (he won several awards), he's best known for his nearly
full-scale dinosaurs made from automotive scrap metal. Once, when
asked &quot;Why dinosaurs?&quot; Jim Gary replied, &quot;Because people like
them.&quot; And we do. They spawned a traveling exhibit: &quot;Dinosaurs of
the Twentieth Century&quot; that spent three decades roaming the earth
and breaking attendance records wherever they went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What:&lt;/b&gt; This specific &quot;Garysaurus&quot; is a nearly life-sized
Stegosaurus painted a vibrant green and still decorated with the
Christmas lights that Jim draped around it. Anatomically, it is
very close to accurate. Is it realistic or abstract based on his
choice of medium and colors? This distinction, for which Jim Gary
was unique, made him unclassifiable in artistic circles. The cache
itself is easily classified: Magnetic micro. However it is NOT
located anywhere on the sculpture or newspaper boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; His dinosaur sculptures are getting harder to find
&quot;in the wild&quot; like this and many are only displayed seasonally.
This excellent example of his art is located by one of Jim's
favorite eateries - the Roadside Diner in Wall Township. He lived
in nearby Farmingdale &amp; ate here nearly every day. He would
periodically swap out the sculpture changing from one giant
colorful dinosaur to another. The building itself is a central
Jersey classic. It opened in 1950 as the Silk City serving hearty
breakfasts &amp; lunches - a tradition that continues to this day.

You&quot;&lt;/a&gt; shot a scene here.&lt;/p&gt;

Booksherpa and I were out on an expedition to place several more Borders Memorial caches before dinner this evening with her father, so we were off to the races! The Freehold Raceway Mall, that is. [:)]

On our way to our proposed cache site, this one was right nearby. We pulled right up, and I grabbed the cache. The good news is that everything was there with no problem. The most current log, though, was pretty wet. We were pressed for time and couldn't stay, but we left the cache with a new baggie. If the next folks to come visit could take a minute or two and dry out the log, that'd sure make it easier to sign.

We signed the log and moved on.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The History:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trademarked PEZ name describes the brand of Austrian confection ... and the range of themed plastic dispensers for such said candy.  The very first candy flavor offered by the PEZ company, peppermint (which in German is Pfefferminz) ... was first introduced in 1927 in Austria ... and first sold in the U.S. in 1952. The PEZ name is formed from three of the letters of this German word.  Although most people think of the dispenser when they hear the name PEZ ... the company considers itself a confectioner (candy maker) ... which manufactures and exports worldwide ... with over 3 billion of the small candies consumed each year in the U.S. alone.  The current style of dispenser most notably recognized w/ heads atop were introduced in 1955 .. with over 1500 variations produced to date.   The candies are currently manufactured in Austria and the U.S. (Connecticut) ... with the dispensers made in Hungary and China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PEZ dispensers are widely collected ... with some specific styles worth hundreds of dollars ... and the highest amounts ranging into the thousands of dollars.  The community of collectors has grown steadily thru the companie's history ... and there are numerous conventions held annually worldwide soley for the purpose of discussing, trading, and the merchandising of PEZ products and paraphanlia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interesting PEZ Links:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.burlingamepezmuseum.com/ (Burlingame PEZ Museum)&lt;br/&gt;http://www.pezcollectorsnews.com/index.html (PEZ collectors site)&lt;br/&gt;http://discombobyoulated.blogspot.com/2010/01/pez-inventor-dies.html (PEZ inventor passes away)&lt;br/&gt;http://www.pezheadsthemovie.com/ (Movie about PEZ collectors)&lt;br/&gt;http://www.pezism.com/ (An artist named Pez; no candy here)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Within) 'In The Land of PEZ' you'll find an array of strange and unique characters.  You might see Mickey Mouse ... or maybe that famous pirate from Pirates of the Carribean.  Or how about Casper the Friendly Ghost, one of your favorite NASCAR drivers, or even a super hero like Batman or Superman.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please trade even/up w/ another PEZ dispenser if you plan on taking one from the container so that other visitors can have the same 'sweet' PEZ experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PEZ dispensers often have special connections in people's lives ... be it their first experience or some funny story involving the PEZ candy dispenser.  If you have a PEZ story of your own that you'd like to share include it in your comments below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden in the northwest section of Joe Palaia park in Ocean Township, NJ.  You can park in the north lot off of Dow Av. and make your way south down the paved path about a quarter mile ... then head west on the dirt path/road (usually muddy) until it turns to the south.  Container is about a hundred feet down this path and a hundred feet off the path.  See hint for further location info.  </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1TL, 3TF! When I realized a while back that I had found nearly all of the exclusive OCs in the county I started saving them for special occasions. Nothing special about today except I felt I needed to get out and stretch my legs (and mind) more than I had in a long time. I happened to have picked up some PEZ swag recently so the timing was good. I parked at my usual spot at the North entrance and walked around to the old familiar road. Heavens help anyone that bushwhacks all the way to this one. =] The last time I visited a cache in this area I only bushwhacked the last 150 feet or so but remembered the side trail making this one much easier on my work clothes. I still had to circle around a bit as I was defeated by the fantastic weed-shield. The coordinates were spot-on however so it didn't take me too long to locate the cache though I was initially looking too high. I opened it up and checked the log to find I was the third to find it. Seems to be a lot of ghost loggers around lately. Only one PEZ remained (Minnie Mouse) so I added my partial PEZ. I had a pencil to drop in too but one of my pencils was already there so I just signed in. The cache is in fine shape. Guess it is all those finds that dooms the smiley caches. ;-) After replacing the cache and adding a few leaves for cover I headed back to the trail where I was met by a muggle with two huge German Sheps that apparently wanted to tear my throat out. Fortunately he was able to hold them back. Guess I wont find my peace out here today. Regardless, I enjoyed finding your OCs and hope you stay in the game in some form. Maybe I'll run into you out here one day! </groundspeak:text>

Unfortunately, I failed to dash anything or stay clean as the snow was up over my knees in spots. Still, the air was crisp and the fresh so I enjoyed the snow-scramble.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an offset cache with the above listed coordinates pointing to the first stage of two.  At this location is the Inukshuk (see description below) ... which sits in the middle of a small creek that feeds into a larger marshy area.  The cache you are searching for (second of two) is 160 ft due East of the Inukshuk rock pile.  It's a cammo'd lock &amp; lock container just off the ground on the edge of the marsh ... about 30 ft off the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'pile of rocks' is known by a few different names. Cairn is the most common term ... but it could also be referred to as a 'trail duck' ... or in some interactive instances where you add your own rock to the pile it's a ritual known as 'isivivane'. Cairns are generally used as a marker of some type. In some cases they may represent some historical/memorial commemoration ... or they might just provide some decorative/artistic value.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 'rock pile' is a special form known as an Inukshuk (or Inuksuk) ... which sources from the Inuit Indian tribes of Arctic North America (Canada, Alaska, Greenland).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting or as a food cache.  Historically the most common type of inuksuk is a single stone positioned in an upright manner.  The word inuksuk means &quot;something which acts for or performs the function of a person&quot;. The word comes from the morphemes inuk (&quot;person&quot;) and -suk (&quot;ersatz&quot; or &quot;substitute&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Please don't 'futz' with the Inukshuk.  Adding or removing rocks from the structure are likely to make it unstable.  See my other 'rock pile' caches for interactive options). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located in Weltz Park in Ocean Township, NJ.   This is a Green Acres tract that is part of the Monmouth County Parks System ... and is one of their (mostly) undeveloped parks.  Park in the small parking lot on West Park Av on the south side of park.  Take the main trail (a Sycamore tree lined dirt road) heading north.   About a quarter mile down this straight road/path will be a crossing of a small creek. The 'rock pile' is in this creek ... east of the crossing ... and the cache is alongside the creek a bit further east.  Backtrack (southbound) about fifty feet from creek crossing and take eastbound trail about a hundred feet to get closer look at Inukshuk.  Cache is another 160 ft down the path (going east) ... and alongside the marsh the creek feeds into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be on lookout for muggles roaming this quiet park.  There aren't usually a lot of people in this park ... but there's a steady stream of visitors throughout the day ... walking, running, or even on horseback.  This path is the only 'dry' crossing of this creek ... so every visitor will pass by at one point or another.  Don't give away the Inukshuk location as this will compromise it's sustainability.  Please defer your approach if other park visitors are nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related Links:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia description of an Inukshuk:&lt;br/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuksuk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pile of rocks as the Canadian Olympic logo (Inukshuk):&lt;br/&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703787304575075461809989010.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference to rocks &amp; stones in the Bible:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2858682/the_significance_of_rocks_and_stones.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia description of a Cairn:&lt;br/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of some unusual cairns:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.rock-on-rock-on.com/cairns.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story about moving a pile of rocks:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.trussel.com/rocks.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock piles appearing around Philadelphia:&lt;br/&gt;http://balacynwyd.patch.com/blog_posts/whats-the-deal-with-the-arranged-piles-of-rocks&lt;br/&gt;http://rocksculptures.blogspot.com/       </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was just sitting there at work when I realized it was lunch time and that there were still OCs I hadn't visited so off I went to Weltz. I messed up when loading my GPSr and this cache wasn't in the DB. I tried the OpenCaching app for my phone and it worked for every cache but this one. Huh? I finally resorted to the good old internet and found the offset that I needed to make the find. Whew! 

On the way there I ran into a freak weather occurrence. On the road in near the &quot;Chocolate&quot; cache I noticed leaves swirling in the field. This isn't unusual except they were really whirling away and ... it wasn't at all windy where I was standing. I've seen smaller versions that I've called &quot;dust devils&quot; whirl across parking lots but this one continued to blow for several minutes moving steadily NNE towards the trail. When it got close enough I waded into the weeds and stood in the &quot;eye&quot;. It's strange to feel wind blowing straight up! It tried to lift my jacket off and leaves were swirling all around me. Very cool! It felt almost dangerous. I walked with the mini-twister as it hit the road and it really did become a dust-devil at this point whipping the sand around. It broke up as it hit the trees on the far side of the road. Gotta love Weltz - prickly pear cactus, honey suckle, chalybeate springs, inukshuks and even mini-tornadoes blowing through! :-D 

At the posted coordinates the Inukshuk wasn't very obvious. I'm not sure if it had been washed flat or if it was the bridge itself. I used a few loose stones laying around to setup a mini cairn just for the fun of it then set off to find the cache. I tried to get there from the wrong side and found myself close but no cigar. I looped around and made a quick find as the cache was fairly exposed. It's in great shape otherwise! I TNLN and signed in as the not so surprising FTF. I rehid the container a little better than I found it but still in plain sight to anyone who manages to get to GZ. Thanks for bringing me back to Weltz, for not giving up on caching all together and TFTOC! </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#2082. Found on my run through Monmouth Battlefield prior to the Meet &amp; Greet event making the most of the longest day of the year. I stowed the cachemobile in the commuter lot and walked over. I tried to take a short-cut around the weedy side of the split-rail and got into some bad brush. The thickness of the briers reminded me of my experience at ENDURING FREEDOM. Of course, there was a better way in which I would find only after getting to GZ and discovering the well hidden cache. I'm not sure the cache was where it used to be based on the previous logs and where the geo-pile was situated. It was in good shape anyway. I TN, dropped in a spare pencil &amp; signed in. I re-hid the cache up a little higher out of the thorns where I found the geo-camo. Only moved 2 foot and not enough to change the difficulty and hopefully back where it used to be. Thanks for bringing me to this great historical site and TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Once upon a time I walked to GZ from the other end of the park and was surprised to find a parking lot. Today my GPS tried to have me drive through the park but I knew better. :smile: A few fishermuggles apparently ice fishing but they didn't pay me any heed. The corrected coordinates worked well and I had the cache in gloved hand quickly. Walked out on the edge to make my mark in privacy. TNLN &amp; SL. The geese avoided me but one big white fella came over to take a gander. I think he gave me the hairy eyeball. Feathery eyeball? Whatever! I replaced the cache as found and took a walk through the park almost all the way back to the parking on the other side. Still lots of snow around but this park didn't get it nearly as bad as the ones near the shore. Thanks for bringing me back to The Top and TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On November 8th, 2008, Circuit City Stores announced the immediate&lt;br /&gt;liquidation and closure of 155 retail stores across the country.&lt;br /&gt;#3671 in Freehold, NJ was among those slated for closure in an&lt;br /&gt;effort to save the company from total bankruptcy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a somewhat unique point of view on these events, since I&lt;br /&gt;had put the previous 5 years of my life into that store as a sales&lt;br /&gt;associate, computer technician, and manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my tenure, I personally sold nearly a million dollars in&lt;br /&gt;inventory, fixed two thousand computers, and called the police for&lt;br /&gt;various reasons 12 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing the store was difficult for everyone involved, not just&lt;br /&gt;for the customers that shopped there, but for the dozens of&lt;br /&gt;employees working there. Following are some memories of life at&lt;br /&gt;Circuit City during and after the closing. I wish I had some&lt;br /&gt;pictures of when the store was fully operational, but I never&lt;br /&gt;thought I would need a picture to remember the store when it was&lt;br /&gt;alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache is a micro magnetized somewhere in a typical fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache reflects on all these ancient fundamental elements that for centuries have been the focus of many cultures around the world.  Now ... right here in Monmouth County New Jersey ... is a simple geocache that is in the spirit of these ancient fundamentals.  It sits daily made of 'Earth' and upon the &quot;Earth' ... overlooks 'Water' ... sits amidst the 'Air' ... under the 'Sun' by day ... and the 'Moon' by night ... and awaits the 'Fire' of desire within you to search it out and make the find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a single stage cache along the edge of a local reservoir.  A beautifully scenic spot overlooking the water on a medium hike in a nice county park.  Cache is hidden under some natural covering in the 'crotch' of a large tree.  An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inukshukgallery.com/inukshuk.html&quot;&gt;Inuksuk&lt;/a&gt; guards the spot on the south side of the tree.  Spend a few moments to reflect in this beautiful natural setting ... the other caches you're after for the day will no doubt be waiting patiently for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden in Thompson Park in Middletown, NJ ... one of the many Monmouth County Parks.  Main entrance to Thompson Park is off of Rt. 520 (Newman Springs Rd).  Park is situated west of Brookdale Community College Campus.  Park near Marlu Lake (back of the park) and head south along the Reservoir Loop trail until you reach the area overlooking the Swimming River Reservoir.  It's not far off this trail on the downside of the hill along the reservoir's edge.     </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">TeamABC decided to go for a nice long walk with the family today and we needed a strollerable trail so we came here! Musclemusher hadn't seen any of your hides yet so this was her first &quot;Inuksuk&quot; cache. Had some initial bounce but once the GPSr settled in we made a quick find. The cache is in good shape and dry and with the leaves down the view was outstanding. We were the second to log in with the Horn Family apparently visiting back on Father's Day. Monster-Truck couldn't decide what she wanted to trade for - it was a green monkey but then she dropped it and we couldn't find it in the leaves. Then we managed to find it but she changed her mind to the little yellow car. Kids. =] We left a spare pencil and signed in. Thanks for another nice cache in a stellar location! </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache brings you to Big Brook Park on Rt. 520 to see the newest trailhead for the Henry Hudson Trail (HHT).  Plan to walk or ride half a mile from the trailhead to the cache and another half mile if you need to return to the trailhead. A very easy nano-cache that is ideal for beginners or bicyclists who wish to ride the last five miles of the HHT after finding the cache. As with all nanos, BYOP!

 br/&amp;gt;
Please note:  Big Brook Park itself is relatively new.  It is different from the nearby Big Brook Reserve in Colts Neck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This trailhead is actually not on the Henry Hudson Trail (HHT) per se, but it is a visible spot (with parking!) to guide people to the last 5 miles of the asphalt-paved HHT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No need to cross the No Trespassing signs onto Camp Arrowhead, which is a YMCA camp on leased land within Big Brook Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the HHT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Henry Hudson Trail (HHT) is a Monmouth County park which is a 24-mile rail-trail built primarily on an abandoned railroad right-of-way.  Some caches refer to the HHT as the Henry Hudson Highway, but that term is only used within geocaching circles.  The HHT is primarily a paved asphalt trail with some exceptions.  The parks system describes 2 sections of the HHT, the 12-mile &lt;u&gt;North&lt;/u&gt; section from Aberdeen/Keyport to Atlantic Highlands/Highlands and the 12-mile &lt;u&gt;South&lt;/u&gt; section, or extension, from Aberdeen/Matawan to Freehold.  But this South section is really 2 sections; it is not continuous in Marlboro where the trail crosses Rt. 79.  The new trailhead at Big Brook brings trail users to where the South section resumes for its last 5 miles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monmouthcountyparks.com/page.aspx?Id=2525&quot;&gt;http://www.monmouthcountyparks.com/page.aspx?Id=2525&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Big Brook Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The original 379 acre parcel of land that established Big Brook Park was formerly used as farmland for patients at the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital, located across the street from the Rt. 520 entrance.  This property once contained a piggery, dairy farm and other agricultural operations.  Named for Big Brook, which drains into the nearby Swimming River Reservoir, the park contains forest made up of young wetland and maturing American beech, White oak, tulip poplar and hickory trees. But the park is better known for its rolling fields made up of grasses, goldenrod and other perennials.&lt;br /&gt;

I actually forgot about it while my mind wondered and I ended up overshooting it by quite a bit. [:o)] Quick find at GZ and no problems with the log. TNLNSL re-rolled tightly and stuck it into the lid to make it just as easy for the next cacher without tweezers. As I was re-rolling a pair of lads rode by on bikes. Nice to see the park getting some use after sitting vacant for so long. [^] Final stats for the day: 2.86 miles, 1 hour 4 minutes. The Summer Critter Count © - 3 squirrels, 2 RWBB, 1 rabbit, 1 cat and one mocking bird taunting me for having to double back on this one. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Took a walk on the Henry Hudson after work and walked into Big Brook by the new &quot;Head&quot;. :smile: I had explored this area a little back in 2007 when I first cached in the area. I ended up basically night caching so it was a little spooky. Today it was bright and sunny and I was able to make a quick find as the cache was a little exposed. Nice container! That should hold up to any kind of flood. [;)] Just as I was signing in I heard a loud *thump* and then the breeze picked up and the trees started creaking at me. Haunted? I believe! I traded a pin for a spare pencil, grabbed the TB and quickly finished logging before some haunted pigs came to eat me. :grin: Before heading out I explored the trail to see where it ended and realized the thump I heard was probably someone's car door slamming. Didn't realize I had gotten this close to the houses. [:o)] I added some camo to the cache on the way back past to keep it safe. Thanks for the history, hike and hide!</groundspeak:text>

Before heading out I explored the trail to see where it ended and realized the thump I heard was probably someone's car door slamming. Didn't realize I had gotten this close to the houses. I added some camo to the cache on the way back past to keep it safe. Thanks for the history, hike and hide!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Turning Basin Park -- Most people now come to this 9.8 acre park in Princeton Twp. for access to the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal and its towpath trail.  But over a hundred years ago, canal boats flocked to this area to unload and turn around.  This cache will draw you into the park in search of a mega bison tube big enough to hold geocoins.  Bring your own pen (BYOP)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My first cache in Mercer County!  Turning Basin Park is a Princeton Twp. municipal park built upon the site of what was once a thriving commercial area with two active turning basins along the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal.  Canal boats could turn around in either basin as well as unload.  The municipal park features picnic facilities and a canoe launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turning basin in a canal is a wider body of water, sometimes described as a land-locked harbor.  Its purpose could be to allow long narrow barges to turn a sharp corner when moving forward . . . or to make a reverse turn to change direction . . . or to simply unload without blocking the canal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basin east of Alexander Road can still be seen; the basin on the west side of Alexander Road has been filled in.</groundspeak:long_description>

There you shall find this cache's namesake. Nearby you will find a
regular sized Lock&amp;Lock container... if you can answer the
below questions.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; As you stand near
the posted coordinates, you will see the impressive Monmouth County
Park System Visitors Center. It was recently reconstructed after
being completely destroyed by fire a few years ago. The fire was
started by a contractor working with a welding torch to install
rain gutters and then fueled by gusting winds. Over 100
firefighters fought the blaze but in the end the building was
destroyed. They did manage to save most of the majestic trees that
surrounded the mansion and the original chimneys. The current
building is, in outward appearances, very similar to the original.
The inside however has been completely modernized to include an
elevator, sprinkler system, offices and exhibit space dedicated to
the history of the Thompson Park &amp; the Visitors Center. To
complete this puzzle I recommend stopping by the visitor center.
You'll learn all you need to know and lots more! It is open on
weekdays from 8 to 4:30 and weekends from 10 to 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A) Who bequeathed the original visitors center to the
county?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    8 - Mary Longstreet Holmes Duncan&lt;br /&gt;
    9 - Geraldine Livingston Thompson&lt;br /&gt;
    8 - William Leeds&lt;br /&gt;
    9 - Maurice Pollak&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B) What was the name of the farm on which the visitors center
now stands?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    0 - Marlu Farm&lt;br /&gt;
    3 - Thompson Fields&lt;br /&gt;
    6 - Lincroft Stables&lt;br /&gt;
    9 - Brookdale Farm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C) What year was the original building constructed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    1 - 1896&lt;br /&gt;
    3 - 1986&lt;br /&gt;
    5 - 1869&lt;br /&gt;
    7 - 1968&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D) When did the original building burn down?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    4 - February 2006&lt;br /&gt;
    3 - December 2005&lt;br /&gt;
    4 - February 2007&lt;br /&gt;
    3 - December 2006&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E) Twentytwo foot tall doric columns graced front porch of the
original building in what configuration?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    3 - 2 Sets of Triple Pillars&lt;br /&gt;
    5 - 3 Sets of Triple Pillars&lt;br /&gt;
    7 - 4 Sets of Double Pillars&lt;br /&gt;
    9 - 5 Sets of Double Pillars&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F) The first filly to win the Kentucky Derby was bred right here
in Thompson Park. What was her name?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    0 - Regret&lt;br /&gt;
    2 - Genuine Risk&lt;br /&gt;
    4 - Rachel Alexandra&lt;br /&gt;
    6 - Winning Colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is located at &lt;b&gt;N40 19.ABC
W074 08.DEF&lt;/b&gt;. Substitute the number associated with the correct
answer to get the coordinates. Good luck &amp; happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;

Pond&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hike:&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the South parking lot in
Holmdel Park or at the Ramanessin Greenway entrance or Bayonet
Farm. You'll enjoy a nice mile to a mile and a half walk no matter
where you choose to begin. The trails get muddy after a rain but
they are well defined and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hide:&lt;/strong&gt; Cache is an ammo can, but it's
concealed differently than usual. Could be a tough hide but the
clue will be very helpful. I suggest approaching GZ from the North.
If you come from the South you'll have to test your mettle. Will it
hold you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History:&lt;/strong&gt; Colonial ownership of this land
dates back to the 1600s and the Holmes family from which Holmdel
gets it's name. Clare Pond is dedicated to Mrs. Clare Prentice,
wife of Bernon Prentice. He had it built in November of 1929 in
memory of his departed wife. That year, Bernon also remodeled the
home &amp; landscaped the grounds. Though the Prentice homestead
has vanished, Clare Pond lives on as a symbol of their love. At one
time the pond was ringed with gardens and ornamental shrubs and
some of the evergreen shrubbery is still present along the North
side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to moving to Central Jersey, the Prentices resided in New
York City where Bernon was listed in the Who's Who of Finance &amp;
Banking. They're names frequently appeared in the New York Times
gossip columns. It's not surprising that they ended up moving out
to the country to escape the public scrutiny. There was more to the
couple than just finance &amp; banking however. Clare, along with
her famous brother Lincoln Ellsworth, funded works of art
throughout the region. Bernon was a decorated officer in World War
1 with the Red Cross. They were married 100 years ago this week
(December 29th 1908). Happy Anniversary Clare &amp; Bernon!&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to approach this cache through Bayonet Farm even though I've never walked its trails before. Never expected to find so many downed trees on the trails; they definitely made this hike more challenging.

My biggest mistake was pursuing the Bayonet Farm trails without a trail map. We wandered much more than needed in pursuit of the Ramenessin Trail, which we ultimately found.

As expected, the Ramenessin Trail from Bayonet Farm first brought us to the southern end of Clare Pond. Even though the GPSr said that GX was only 180' away, the terrain to get to GX from the southern approach is not easy. I knew from Google Maps that the Ramenessin Trail would go past the southern edge of Clare Pond, then loop around and bring us to the northern approach of Clare Pond and better access to GX. But one of my sons was getting quite anxious to go home, so I called off the hunt for today.

$pyker907 and I will return on another day and find this cache!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'pile of rocks' is known by a few different names.  Cairn is the most common term ... but it could also be referred to as a 'trail duck' ... or in some interactive instances where you add your own rock to the pile it's a ritual known as 'isivivane'.  Cairns are generally used as a marker of some type.  In some cases they may represent some historical/memorial commemoration ... or they might just provide some decorative/artistic value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 'Pile of Rocks' is in the creek just east of the trail in Ramanessin Woods.  The coordinates listed above are for the hidden cache at the creek's edge ... and only about 100 feet from the rock pile in the middle of the creek.   There's no need to cross or enter the creek for access to the cache container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trees in these woods are of varied age and in some cases could date as old as hundred years ... but a rock ... and possibly even these rocks that make up this cairn ... are likely much older ... maybe even thousands of years old.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out some of the links below to see what others have to say about piling up rocks in unique and unusual ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located just off a wooded path on the eastern edge of Ramanessin Woods in Holmdel, New Jersey.  This is a beautiful 227 acre addition to Holmdel Park.  It's mostly a series of open field areas which were likely farmland at one time ... and has some wooded sections around it's perimiter.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was in Bayonet Farm for the Earthday festival and decided to take a walk into Holmdel Park to visit the new OC and perform maintenance on my own caches in the area. I had Monster-Truck in her Adventure Backpack of Caching (lite edition) and she was thrilled with the bouncy ride getting to GZ. ;-) 
It took us a few minutes of poking around before finally coming up with the well hidden cache. Traded a frog for spare pencil and signed in. I guess I signed the wrong side of the logbook because I thought I was the first to visit. Oops! It's nice to see the OCs finally getting some visits either way. The cache is in fine condition but the Cairn has seen better days. Very peaceful spot to hang out but I had to keep moving or M-T gets itchy. Thanks for bringing me back down to the Big Ram and TFTH! </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Longstreet farm is a &quot;living history&quot; farm in Holmdel, Monmouth County, NJ. Take in the sights, smells &amp; sounds of rural life in the 1890s. Watch the costumed interpretive staff plow, plant, harvest, cook &amp; clean, honoring the methods &amp; customs of the 19th century. Visit the blacksmith (demonstrations every 2rd Sunday 1-3PM), step inside the massive Dutch Barn, help milk a cow or grind corn, pet the horses, mules, sheep, hogs &amp; chickens that roam the grounds. There's something going on at the farm in all seasons - just as there would be in a 19th century farm. The farm is open daily from 10am to 4pm and from 9am to 5pm between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Admission &amp; parking is free. The posted coordinates will bring you to the visitor center and a standard micro hide. The cachetainer is small enough for only the log, a pencil fragment and the smallest of small swag but pathtags fit nicely.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the farm &amp; happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on Longstreet Farm, including the upcoming activities: http://www.monmouthcountyparks.com/page.asp?agency=130&amp;Id=2530&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully this photo gallery will entice you to come out for a visit: &lt;br/&gt;http://pix.ericles.com/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=2822</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cute little park with a playground in Solebury holds a secret...

Today I took a wrong turn trying to follow detours around Solebury
township. I ended up at a park I have never seen before. A park I
have not seen on the map because there was no cache here. Until
today. So I hopped out of the car, and found a good spot. You will
not need to go on any private property to find this cache, but you
may need to go through poison ivy or pick up some ticks. I averaged
the coordinates but my GPSr has been acting strangely at times
lately, so they might be a little off. If so, let me know and I
will update the coordinates.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tatum Park has a variety of tree species ... some as old or older than 100 years.  These four Tulip Poplar trees stand as two pairs ... each one in the pair about six feet apart ... and each pair standing a few feet from either side of the trail.  These giants tower into the top of the canopy of these woods ... and have likely guarded this spot for generations.   I've hidden a small camoed lock &amp; lock within about 30 feet of these giant Poplars ... and placed a little guardian between one of the tree pairs to watch over the hide in my absence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is hidden in Tatum Woods ... a beautiful natural park in Middletown, NJ, part of the Monmouth County Park System.  It's 366 acres is mostly undeveloped w/ a series of meadow and wooded trails suitable for hiking, running, and horseback riding.  There's two public entry points ... one on the eastern side of the park off of Red Hill Rd, and the other on the northern side of the park off of Holland Rd. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Approach:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;My preferred approach is to park in the lot on Holland Rd on the north edge of the park.  Head south across the field and cross the bridge ... making your way thru the first and second meadows (Meadow Run trail) until you reach the trailhead entering the woods.  Bear left and take the Tatum Ramble trail loop all the way out to the southernmost edge of the park ... as this is where the two 'twins' are located.  The cache is hidden just feet off of the path in the remains of a fallen (small) tree hollow ... just thirty feet or so short of the twin trees.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monmouthcountyparks.com/page.aspx?Id=2538&quot;&gt;Monmouth County Parks - Tatum Park Info&lt;/a&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I finally worked up the guts to visit Tatum to survey the carnage that Hurricane Sandy undoubtedly wrought on the magnificent trees of this forest. I'm happy to report that most of the giants survived without much/any noticeable damage. :) I took the long loop to this cache following &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; multi stages doing cache maintenance along the way. I know this location well - it is known as &quot;The Brothers&quot; in the waypoints of the aforementioned multi. Alas, I miscalculated how long it would take me to do a loop through the park - especially with so many trees down along the trails - so it was nearly dark when I arrived at GZ. Initially my GPSr had me up on top of the hill above the trail where there is another small trail but settled in to a spot more as described in the cache page. Unfortunately it was too dark to really search at that point so I wont call this a DNF just yet. Maybe it was also buried under all of the leaves that have fallen since this was hidden. Excuses! I have recently been working on at least visiting every cache in my 10 mile radius and I saved this one for last just because I really like the location. I'd love to have made the find but at least I can say I visited the area and now I have an excuse to come back again to visit the Twin Brothers. Thanks for bringing me out today. I will be back!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Cinnamon Stick is a single stage hide that was inspired by a large fallen tree lying right next to a wooded path in Holmdel Park in Monmouth County, NJ.  This fallen tree looks exactly like a huge rolled cinnamon stick.  The cache is hidden 'near' this large fallen tree (refer to the listed coordinates above for the exact location of the hide).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best Approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park in the Hill Top lot at the north end of the park (near the tennis courts).  Enter the Ridge Walk trail behind the tennis courts heading east.  Take the High Point trail down the ridge side (blue trail) till you get to the Marsh trail.  Take the Marsh trail a couple hundred yards until you come upon the 'big cinnamon stick'.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several trees from the genus Cinnamomum that is used in both sweet and savoury foods. Cinnamon trees are native to South East Asia, and its origin was mysterious in Europe until the sixteenth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BCE.  Cinnamon was once so highly-prized that wars were fought over it, it was used as currency, and it has aphrodisiacal powers. The Hebrew Bible makes specific mention of the spice many times.  It was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To protect their monopoly as suppliers, its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade.  Through the Middle Ages, the source of cinnamon was a mystery to the Western world.  In Herodotus and other authors, Arabia was the source of cinnamon: giant Cinnamon birds collected the cinnamon sticks from an unknown land where the cinnamon trees grew and used them to construct their nests.  This myth about the source of cinnamon existed for centuries before it's true source (native to Sri Lanka) was understood.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval physicians used cinnamon in medicines to treat coughing, hoarseness and sore throats. As a sign of remorse, Roman Emperor Nero ordered a year's supply of cinnamon be burnt after he murdered his wife.  By 1833, the downfall of the cinnamon monopoly had begun when other countries found it could be easily grown in such areas as Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Mauritius, Réunion and Guyana. Cinnamon is now also grown in South America, the West Indies, and other tropical climates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinnamon is harvested by growing the tree for two years then coppicing (periodic cutting/pruning) it. The next year, about a dozen shoots will form from the roots.  The branches harvested this way are processed by scraping off the outer bark, then beating the branch evenly with a hammer to loosen the inner bark. The inner bark is then prised out in long rolls.  &lt;br/&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;A 4 stage &quot;storybook&quot; multi-cache which will take you on
a tour of Tatum's trees&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the hunter's
tree-stand 100 foot south of stage one. The hunter has been seen
here on Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees are at the heart of geocaching. While upright they provide
the landscape of our game. At their end they provide our hiding
spots &amp; muggle cover. They are shade on a summer day, the
warmth on a winter night, the foundation for the birders &amp; the
challenge for the climbers. They hold the waters and anchor the
earth to the sky. They are the sanctuary to the small and fragile
and the guardians of the breath. This cache is for the trees - my
strong silent friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growing up I was always a fan of Shel Silverstein's books.
I found his unique outlook and simple illustrations very appealing.
Later I grew up to appreciate the works on different levels. My
favorite book of his was always &lt;i&gt;The Giving Tree&lt;/i&gt;. The story
follows the life of a tree as it watches a boy grow up. The story
often invokes a strong response and is much deeper than the
simplistic writing style and line art convey. I'll let you form
your own opinions but to see the story as I do consider: Every word
is true. The tree is happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a four stage multi-cache. The purpose is to direct
you around Tatum Park on a tour of the park's most interesting
trees. Not every one was a good spot for a cache so those are
simply waymarked. No micros here - all of the stages are small
painted lock-n-locks. Feel free to drop swag/trade along the way as
the final is &quot;log only&quot;. Very little bushwhacking is necessary but
there are thorns &amp; poison ivy along the way. From start to
finish the hike is about a mile depending on your route but
probably double that with the round trip from parking. The park is
open dawn to dusk. Grab a map, hit the trails and keep your eyes
peeled for groundhogs, rabbits, raccoons, skunks &amp; deer
throughout this wonderful park. This cache has been a labor of love
for me and I hope you enjoy it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;For every group finding this cache a copy of &lt;i&gt;The
Giving Tree&lt;/i&gt; will be purchased and donated to charity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This cache is certified &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://CentralJerseyGeocaching.net&quot;&gt;Central

Making a loop of Old Bridge on the outer edge of my 10 mile radius today following the Pizza event in Spotswood. It wasn't long ago I used to ride by here every day on my way home from work. Now it took me months before I found myself going past but only seconds to make the find once I found the right upright. [;)] Seen a few of these but they can be tricky the first time. All is well and dry. Signed up the brand new log and headed off down the road. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Terrain is flat and easy, but I suppose there's a chance that some weeds will have a chance to grow near the cache. Shouldn't be a problem. Not wheelchair accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden in a small plastic box with a snap lid. It's clearly marked as a Geocache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;A kid-friendly cache &amp; a short walk around the North side of
Tatum Park where, if you're lucky, you'll get to meet one of the
last Weedlins in all of New Jersey.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mythology:&lt;/b&gt; If the Ents are the shepherds of the
forest, then the Weedlins are the shepherds of meadows &amp;
wildflowers. They're part of the landscape of nature itself. Like
weeds they're plucky, mischievous &amp; protective of their lands.
The ancient Greeks called them the Lemoniads. The Native Americans
left them offerings. Colonial Farmers gave them their modern name
but revered them for renewing the fields &amp; protecting the land
from erosion. Now a days they're hard to come by but I've
discovered at least one living in Tatum Park. I hid a cache nearby
which, if the Weedlin hasn't eaten it yet again, shouldn't be too
hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend:&lt;/b&gt; In the Summer of 1779 the land of Tatum Park
was a small farm owned by a family that was struggling to just keep
the farm running. To make matters worse, British soldiers were
occupying their land. Young Emily had a magnificent garden of
native flowers, but the wildflowers that grew in the meadows were
her favorite. Emily watched with irritation as the troops made camp
in a field that was being allowed to grow natural that season. They
crushed down her beloved wildflowers &amp; greedily ate the berries
she had been cultivating all Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the soldiers took notice &amp; saved a large bouquet of
flowers, which he presented to her one morning. Despite their
differences, the two fell in love. Though she never tried to change
his mind, her love of the land was infectious &amp; soon after
being deployed into battle the young soldier defected to the
Colonial Army. He promised to marry her when he returned. He wrote
to Emily frequently over the next year but one day the letters
stopped coming. The years piled up, the war ended &amp; she lost
hope &amp; began to despair. She was inconsolable. As Emily's
health began to fail so did the farm. Crops withered, fruits dried
on the vine &amp; not a flower could be seen on the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the occasion of the first frost in 1783 Emily took a walk in
the North East meadow, sat down to rest under a willow tree &amp;
never woke up. She was buried in that same meadow. On Christmas Eve
of that season her lover finally returned. He had been captured by
the British &amp; sent over seas as a prisoner of war. The
revolution ended before he could stand trial &amp; eventually he
was able to make his way back to the colonies. Her soldier was
saddened when he heard the news of her death but war had hardened
him &amp; he could shed no tears. Emily's mother led him to the
gravesite. As he knelt by Emily's final resting place, her Mother
placed a bundle of dried flowers alongside the headstone. The
soldier recognized the flowers as the very bouquet he gave her when
they first met. His heart finally broke &amp; he began to weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Spring life returned to the farm when a lone
Morning Glory bloom unfolded to greet the dawn. It had sprouted
alongside Emily's grave where her love's tears fell to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hide:&lt;/b&gt; Bring the kids! Take the Dogwood Hollow trail
&amp; a short unnamed trail to within 15 feet of the cache. You'll
be hunting for a non-traditional cache container hidden in a
traditional way. &lt;b&gt;The Weedlin kept stealing my original
containers so I moved the cache a little further outside the
meadow.&lt;/b&gt; If you find one of these original cache containers
(possibly near the Weedlin) please feel free to grab it and rehide
it. The containers are ready to go with a pencil, log &amp; swag.
Just mention in your log that you snagged one of the Weedlin’s
caches. In this way the beneficial, if mischievous Weedlins can
expand their habitats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Park:&lt;/b&gt; Monmouth County's Tatum Park contains 366 acres
of woods &amp; fields including a playground &amp; six miles of
trails. You can park at either the Red Hill Road or Holland Rd
activity centers. While in the area be sure to visit Emily's old
homestead &amp; the possible remains of her flowerbed:

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Both stages of this multi-cache are in Phillips Park, home to two ballfields, two giant satellite dishes, and now two stages of this multi-cache.  The log is only in the second cache.  There is no need to go past any chain-link fences at the park's edges.  Long pants are suggested; you may be walking through poison ivy! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-ordinates on this cache page are for the first cache, an unusual micro concealing the co-ordinates for the second, final cache.  The first cache lays on the ground but isn't a stone.  The second cache is a green mega bison tube big enough for geocoins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phillips Park is in Holmdel off of Telegraph Hill Road.  It is not in Telegraph Hill Park. The woods behind Phillips Park border the Garden State Arts Center (a.k.a. PNC Arts Center), but there is no need to go to the Arts Center to find to this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Phillips Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This municipal park features a softball field, lighted baseball field, basketball courts, backstops for handball or tennis practice, picnic tables, and short hiking trails surrounded by a ring of tall, lush trees. The six-mile long Ramanessin Brook Greenway begins here, though I am not certain if you can start hiking the greenway from that point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phillips Park was formerly the control center for the U.S. Army's Nike Missile Battery 54. A handful of military people worked and lived here to support the Nike missiles guarding New York Harbor. For the past decade I believed -- incorrectly -- that the missiles were once deployed in the ground at Phillips Park. But I learned recently that the missiles had been housed elsewhere in Holmdel in an area that now belongs to Holmdel Park, near the tennis courts as shown at the bottom of this long web page:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.monmouthcountyparks.com/page.aspx?ID=3630&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only visible remnants from the U.S. Army base today at Phillips Park may be the handball court, chainlink fencing, and the large satellite structures which had been used as antennas in conjunction with a complex anti-aircraft defense system used prominently in most major American cities throughout the mid-1950s until the mid-1970s.   </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I can understand why BigA had to do this one twice. I initially had the park to myself but then a father coaching his son in baseball showed up and started B.P. on the lower field. I was hidden from view for my search which didn't take long. I took a round-about way to stage two just for some extra walking and then was completely unable to find the cache. I walked back to stage one to verify that I didn't fat finger the coordinates and retrieved the hint from the car. Ah! Revelation! Back to stage two with hint in hand and still couldn't find it. A muggle was running wind-sprints around the ball field now so I had to time my searching to when he was around the other side. I found lots of thorns and tons of lost baseballs.... and then I though I finally spotted the cache. Nope! Ok, one more time.... back to stage one to re-verify my coordinates with the light starting to fade. I keep spooking the same set of rabbits as I stroll past. The father is no longer coaching but just berating the kid and really laying into him with threats and namecalling. Unnecessary. They packed up when they realized there were other people noticing the nonsense. I considered calling it quits for the night but gave it one more try and finally all the pieces came together and I found just what I was looking for all along as described in the cache page. This is why some cachers avoid Multis - you never know what you're getting into! I initially thought the difficulty/terrain was a bit too high but now I think it is about right. TN, left a spare pencil and block that I found near GZ. All coordinates were pretty good once I figured out how to work my GPSr .

I didn't count on hanging out to watch some of the ballgame that was in progress here. No worries though... who needs daylight? :grin: I followed my backtrail from the old LotR cache that was back this way and made my way past some itchy vines and some murky puddles to GZ where I was able to make a quick find. TNLN (as I have an ample supply of my own [;)]) and signed in. Thanks for placing this and for keeping it active! Caches close to home always keep me caching.</groundspeak:text>

Found during the CITO...  I liked this multi cache.  It was a wonderful day caching with friends and completing a CITO at the same time.  I enjoyed exploring Cheesequake.. 

I had never been to Cheesequake before.  I was very impressed with the visitor center and the wide variety of terrain.  I learned about the three habitats located within Cheesequake State Park. The Center also provides information on the Native American and early colonization of the area. 

Cheesquake offers a striking example of vegetation change along a gradient from coastal salt marsh habitat to upland forests can be observed from the various trails running through the natural area. The natural area displays a diversity of plant species and community types characteristic of both northern and southern New Jersey. Part of the parks uniqueness lies in its geographical location. Not only is it situated near transition between the urban north and suburban central New Jersey, it lies in a transitional zone between two different ecosystems. Open fields, saltwater and freshwater marshes, a white cedar swamp, Pine Barrens, and a northeastern hardwood forest are all characteristics of the park.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#1825. Found! I struck out the first time but it turned out the first stage was M.I.A. This time armed with an extra hint from the C/O I ventured out in the snow on a cool, but not cold day to see if I could get lucky. The trails were much worse than I hoped - slippery and slushy - but passable. I didn't mind the snow so much though - I had the trails to myself and all of the wildlife was out in force. I took the Green/Red trail past the nature center then just the Green then walked the road for a bit (which was actually harder going than the trails as they were not at all plowed) and then finally back on the green trail. When I crested the hill by &quot;Spacy's Place&quot; cache I spooked 7 or 8 deer which ran off in every direction. Neat! Some of the &quot;steps&quot; areas up and down required some toe-in-snow techniques to get up and skiing style to get down which I enjoyed thoroughly. :smile: When I finally arrived at the first stage GZ I ended up making a quick find. It's in good shape and snow free. [;)] I expected stage two to be in the other direction from where it was but I knew there was a trail so I quickly navigated to within 100 feet. That's 100 feet as the crow flies... but I had to climb! I followed some deer prints and made another quick find. The coordinates were spot-on for me today! There was some snow guarding the cache but not so much that I couldn't see the hide. Grabbed the TB, dropped in a spare pencil &amp; took my time signing in while the smell of Big Ed's wafted down the valley making me hungry. There was an extra signature in the log that didn't log online. I re-hid the cache using what I had available without digging out the concealing  snow and took a different route back to mask my boot-prints though they will probably all be melted after this week's mini-heat wave. Thanks for bringing me back to the old Green Trail and TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#2596. Found with Monster-Truck on a hike in Cheesequake. I wanted to see the Hurricane Sandy damage first hand and check on some of my hides so we came in through the Park-and-Ride and marveled at the wholesale destruction. Apparently the snowstorm did a number on the trees as well. There was a squad of chainsawmen near &quot;Bigfoot&quot;. They have a LOT of work to do! With the sound of their saws still ringing in our ears we turned off the main road and wondered towards GZ. Fortunately most of the trees in this area were spared and I was able to make the find. M-T wanted a coin so we traded that for a spare pencil and signed in. The cache is in good shape. Glad I finally made it over to this one. Thanks for the hike and hide!</groundspeak:text>

I stopped by here one other time for a very quick look but I was not in appropriate attire for caching at the time so I moved along. There are several items in the area that could match the hint especially given that the coordinates appear to be off a bit. After systematically checking most of these spots and using a hint provided by a previous finder, I found the cache in good shape. Nice area back here but please be aware I found a lot of evidence that some people hang out back here to engage in non-geocaching related activities. Thanks for the hide.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#2562. The do have an annual carnival. The second Saturday in September apparently. :grin: We heard the music from all the way down by the yacht club so I knew there was some serious street fair going on. As we got closer I identified it as modern [url=http://spanish.about.com/cs/culture/f/germanmusicqa.htm]Bavarian Tejano Polka[/url]. Once upon a time Perth Amboy was largely Polish I'm sure the Polka, sung in Spanish or not, wasn't unheard of to this town. Turns out we had walked into the Mexican Pride festival or something similar. Interestingly enough I've now been to the Mexican and Puerto Rican pride festivals. Heck, I inadvertently led the PR Day Parade through town. :grin: Anyway, not many people were on the beach so Musclemusher entertained Monster-Truck down at the water's edge while I made a quick search and find. Nice placement. I knew just what to look for but muggles would be unlikely to spot it. TNLNSL. After, we sauntered right through the middle of the festival and were very tempted to try out of the food but had to get on home for M-T's bedtime. The sunset was very nice on the walk back. Thanks for bringing us here and TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Quick Cache (just for the numbers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Quick Cache (just for the numbers) in this vast cacheless area of west central NJ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.</groundspeak:long_description>

It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.</groundspeak:long_description>

It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of parking within 200 feet.  This area flooded recently but should be good till the next 100 year flood.  Poor drainage after rains.  About 10 feet from the grass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the Few Parks without a cache in NJ. We walk the Dog around this park on a regular basis and it feels like our first cache should be on familiar ground! The small stream nearby has some deeper pools where the Dog loves to cool off in the summer. This is NJ so beware of &lt;b&gt;Ticks and Mossies&lt;/b&gt; in the woods!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is limited parking (depending on whether soccer is in progress). From Division Avenue turn west onto Grove Terrace. At “T” turn right to field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Cache will be the co-ordinates of a nearby larger cache with room for some small Tradables, geo-coins etc. Its a 10/15 minute walk through the woods (there is a path - no need to get wet) to the final cache. The cache is a about 50 feet from the path in the woods (away from the railway track) - very little bush wacking needed although may be a little wet underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>MKH - initial cache
Anyone for tennis? You can see some courts from the final cache point in the wood, slightly obscured by a small tree in the middle of a large gravel bank. There is a path to within 20ft of the Cache parallel to the raised bank. Adding 0.007n seems to help some.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

THIS CACHE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON OTHER SITES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Califon was a station on the High Bridge Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The rail line was abandoned in 1976 and now serves as a Hunterdon County-administered rail trail called Columbia Trail, which runs south to High Bridge and north to points in Morris County.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the mills were present in the area of Califon for some time prior to its incorporation as a town, it was quite a while before growth became evident in the mid-nineteenth century. It was first called California, from Jacob Neighbor's enthusiasm in the milling business about the time the California Gold Rush broke out. The Borough was incorporated by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of both Lebanon and Tewksbury Townships on April 2, 1918.[9] Local legend has it that California became a regular stop for weekend excursion trains through the countryside. When riders bought their tickets they were issued a voucher good for an ice cream; the train would stop so tourists could wander around and cash in their ice cream coupons. Anxious to exploit this source of outside revenue, residents petitioned the Railroad to let them build a real station, which they did as a community project. The station is said to be the one shown in the picture on the right. Citing the local account again, two sign painters who came to letter the sign rode the train from Dunellen, but the background paint wasn't dry when they arrived. They sat and drank at the hotel, which later burned down. By the time the sign was ready for their artistic touch, the local tale says, &quot;Califon&quot; was as close to California as the inebriated painters could manage. Califon is also situated just north of the Kenneth Lockwood Gorge on the South Branch of the Raritan River; this pristine stretch of clear water and forest is a well-known treasure for New Jersey trout fishermen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Califon Historical Society has registered 170 structures with the National Register of Historic Places. Califon is a Victorian-style enclave where the houses are marked with the names of the builders and their dates of establishment rather than with street numbers. The center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough. Recently the State of New Jersey announced they were going to replace the bridge, using the fact that a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved. (Account featured on Califon website).&lt;br/&gt;Califon became a regional household name when frequently mentioned by Merv Griffin on his TV show during the 1970s. He and his wife Juliette owned a home in nearby Lebanon Township, which had a Califon mailing address, and, while they were married, they were often seen visiting the village in a fringed-top Bermuda-style resort cart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-wikipedia.com&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.&lt;br/&gt;        </groundspeak:long_description>

This property is an important component of the Primrose Brook Greenway, which is a corridor of preserved properties that safeguard stream water quality, serve as a conduit for plants and animals to move throughout the stream corridor, and provide natural areas to filter pollutants carried by stormwater runoff from adjacent developed areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primrose Preserve is an important contributing property to this Greenway because of it's location, immediately downstream from Route 287. It is also an ecological wonder in it's own right. The property consists of forested wetlands along both sides of the stream corridor that include American beech, spicebush, red oak, hickory and flowering dogwood. Even with the property's close proximity to Route 287 a variety of wildlife have been observed.</groundspeak:long_description>

The horse shows include English and Western Pleasure classes as well as an annual Dressage Show.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dressage is a concentrated discipline of horsemanship that creates a synergistic relationship between horse and rider. While dressage literally means “training” in French, it is so much more than that. In Dressage, the horse and rider create a bond that enables them to communicate seamlessly through the rider aides – thus creating a ballet-like dance. To the average person, these aides are nearly imperceptible, which makes it appear as though the horse is performing on his own and the rider is simply a passenger. At the upper levels, the horse and rider have all but mastered the art of non-verbal communication. The horse willingly performs the difficult tasks asked with style and grace.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJC is about promoting a quality caching experience in Northern New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJC.ORG&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a gate across the parking lot, so please follow the park rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Snowy Day Cache Series is simply a dash and cache you can locate after a snow storm when you want to go caching. The Snowy Day cache locations should be easy to locate on a snowy day, sign the log, then be on your way. The Snowy Day caches are higher off the ground so there is no need for searching for a cache on the ground under the snow. This cache is protected but may be slightly snow covered after a storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loantaka Brook Reservation offers 5 miles of multi-use paved trails stretching throughout the park. This Morris County Park got its name from the Native American Lenni-Lenape Tribe. Loantaka means &quot;the place of the cold winter&quot; which refers to the Great Swamp and surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed for all those dedicated geocachers who brave all the weather elements to seek a geocache and keep their streak alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these geocacher couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJC is about promoting a quality caching experience in Northern New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJC.ORG&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Years ago it may have been a much deeper pond that has gradually filled in. This spot has become home to Great Blue Herons, green frogs and spring peepers. In 2010 a new boardwalk has been constructed through the cattail marsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The ten towns are: Bernardsville, Bernards Township, Chatham Township, Harding Township, Long Hill Township, Madison Borough, Mendham Borough, Mendham Township, Morristown and Morris Township.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great Swamp Watershed is a 55-square-mile region in Morris and Somerset Counties of the state of New Jersey, and includes portions of ten different towns. A watershed is a geographical area all of whose streams flow into a single body of water. In the Great Swamp Watershed, five streams – the Upper Passaic River, Black Brook, Great Brook, Loantaka Brook, and Primrose Brook all flow into Great Swamp and exit as the Passaic River via Millington Gorge.</groundspeak:long_description>

The 570-acre Loantaka Brook Reservation is situated between Morristown and Madison, one of the more densely urbanized areas in the country.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The park is a long, narrow corridor along the Loantaka Brook. Although located near urban areas, the park is surprisingly rural, with little civilization in evidence. The brook is paralleled by a paved bicycle path and an unpaved bridle path, both of which can be combined to form a very pleasant six-mile-long hike. Although the park is frequented by joggers and bicyclists, it is also extensively used by walkers, and the wide bicycle path can accommodate all types of users. Kitchell Pond is near the northern end, and an historic horse barn, built in 1834 and still used for horses, is situated towards the southern end of the park.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Trails Overview: The reservation has about five miles of marked paved trails, as well as a three-mile unpaved bridle path. These trails can be combined to form a six-mile loop.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Most were old property boundaries before the Counties and State parks acquired the properties, and simply left the old fences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Loantaka Brook Reservation has a few rusty old chain linked fences dividing the park. Sometimes you need to walk along the fence looking for that down tree on top of the fence or where nature and time has beaten back the old fence looking for a place you can cross.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Old Fences Cache is located in Loantaka Brook Reservation, which offers 5 miles of multi-use paved trails stretching throughout the park. This Morris County Park got its name from the Native American Lenni-Lenape Tribe. Loantaka means &quot;the place of the cold winter&quot; which refers to the Great Swamp and surrounding area.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The GPS might be off a little (used 3 different GPS' to get the coords) because of the leaves and a mountain ridge full of iron.  (The Hint will make up for the coords.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A camoed 4x4x6 L&amp;L that is almost a C&amp;D at the parking lot of Point Mountain, a GREAT VIEW from the top at 932 feet.  Over looks the Musconetcong Valley.  Lots of fishing by the bridge about 100 feet away.  Several hiking trails from this parking lot.  Enjoy  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Point Mountain is one of the highest mountains in NJ. There is a great overlook and lots of trails. One trail goes up to the overlook and then splits, one trail goes to the north and center sections of the park along the mountain ridge thru the woods. The other branch goes south thru woods and the a large grass field. There are two trails along the river. Walk on! This is a county park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The legend of the headless horseman has appeared in many forms of literature throughout history and throughout the world. Many countries have their own unique version of the legend in which some form of the headless horseman appears.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The most recognizable headless horseman is the one that appears in Washington Irving's short story, which was published in 1819. The story is set in America, within a 1790's Dutch settlement that residents nicknamed “Sleepy Hollow”. Its protagonist is a schoolteacher named Ichabod Crane, whose apparent demise results from a meeting with the horseman. The horseman himself is allegedly a Hessian soldier from the Revolutionary War who was decapitated by a cannonball and now roams Sleepy Hollow on the back of his horse, with his severed head resting upon the pommel of his saddle. He is therefore also called the 'Galloping Hessian'.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Horseman is said to be incapable of crossing the bridge at the town entrance (a possible reference to the belief that ghosts cannot cross water), although he is shown throwing his head across a river to strike down Ichabod Crane. Ichabod's fate is left ambiguous; some of the background characters allege that he has been &quot;carried off&quot; by the Horseman, while others suggest that he has been frightened out of the county by the ghost and by the prospect of facing his landlord, later to become a lawyer in Philadelphia. It is implied later that the Horseman was in fact Brom Bones, Ichabod's rival for the hand in marriage of the local beauty Katrina van Tassel, who imitated the legend of the Galloping Hessian on purpose to kill or frighten away his competitor.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The fact that a shattered pumpkin is found beside Ichabod's abandoned hat supports this, in that the pumpkin may easily have been used to simulate the Horseman's severed head. Intriguingly, there is no mention of a severed head in the story heard by Ichabod, though it is prominent in his own encounter with the horseman.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&quot;The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance ... the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak. ”&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;—Washington Irving, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJC is about promoting a quality caching experience in Northern New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;NNJC.ORG&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

However with my wife we decided to take some walk instead of running around for the Hunt. So we started here where we parked and walked along the trails here. Did some 4 mile walking at least and both of us enjoyed it. Had some muddy places, some real easy and some not that easy finds.
Dear CO.
Thanks for these caches in the park.
Just re-hided the cache when a group came by and we exchanged some words on the geocaching, but then we went on our way.

Try making a cell call while looking for the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites.</groundspeak:long_description>

Don't forget your twizzers!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Columbia Trail is a rail  to trails in  north center New Jersey. It was created from portions of the former Central Railroad  for a total of 16.2 miles. Columbia Gas Company bought the trail right-of-way and laid an underground gas pipeline under the right-of-way along the length of the trail.   County Department of Parks and Recreation  now operate and maintain the trail under lease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Columbia Trail is quite scenic,  a notable portion of the Columbia Trail is the Ken Lockwood Gorge,  The South Branch of the Raritan River parallels the trail through the gorge, and is a scenic fast-flowing small river with recreational activities, especially fly fishing. A 60-foot (18 meter) trestle carries the trail over the river in the gorge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail surface is relatively flat and consists mostly of fine crushed stone.&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

Camoed pill bottle just off Heinz (Route) 57. &lt;br /&gt;
Cache is in the new, near the old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Cache is about 200 feet south of a &quot;Grotto&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;
From a local, &quot;the structure was erected by a German family (the original land owner) just after WW II. It was done to simulate such stuctures that are commonly found in farm areas in Europe. They  lived in the yellow house just down the road. They also constructed a grotto with both English and German signs just across the road from their house.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the stone bridge over the river and the bridge over the stream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Patriots' Path is a network of hiking, biking and equestrian trails and green open spaces linking several dozen Federal, state, county and municipal parks, watershed lands, historic sites and other points of interest across Morris County. The Patriots' Path stretches from East Hanover which connects with the Lenape Trail in Essex County to Allamuchy Mountain State Park in Sussex County and the Village of High Bridge in Hunterdon County.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Patriots' path trail system is to provide opportunities for passive outdoor recreation while protecting and enhancing the environmental and aesthetic integrity of the stream valleys and uplands through which it passes. Much of the Path lies along the corridors of the Whippany and Black Rivers and the South Branch of the Raritan. The Black River and South Branch of the Raritan are two of the most pristine trout production streams in the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail system is stabilized in many sections with crushed stone and gravel, other areas are left as narrow paths on earth and rock and shorter sections in Morristown and Morris Twp. area are paved. Several miles lie on cinder and gravel beds of old railroad lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Patriots' Path cache is located along a section of the scenic Whippany River, unfortunately the noise from route 287 interrupts this peaceful serenity, but enjoy the flowing river views as you hike along the Patriots' Path. This cache can be found in winter as it is not on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJC is about promoting a quality caching experience in Northern New Jersey. NNJC.ORG</groundspeak:long_description>

It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.&lt;br/&gt;(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Route_31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT listed on other sites. </groundspeak:long_description>

It was really VERY NICE that Alan would put a cache so close to the NNJC event next Monday.  The cache is not common from the standpoint that it is hidden a little different.  The hint made me blush and was helpful!
It was also very helpful as NNJC had a pre-planning meeting tonight and I was a little early so when I parked in the wrong spot I was able to shed a few pounds before I found the cache.

Thanks Alan for placing and maintaining this cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to the memory of our German Shepherd,
Eick von Wolfsrevier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eick (“Ike”) was a magnificent working dog with dozens of
competition awards from local and regional events. He was trained,
by my wife, in Schutzhund (tracking, obedience and protection)
which simulates international police work. As a team, they earned
the highest international title in Schutzhund (SchH 3) and dozens
of trophies and awards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eick loved this park. As a family, we spent many, many enjoyable
hours here both training and having fun. Eick’s cache is filled
with lots of doggie things and toys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is available. There are several routes to the cache but the
most enjoyable is from the trailhead waypoint. A trail map is
posted there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1GZY9 - Community Center Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 53.863 W 074° 21.790&lt;br /&gt;Community Center Parking Lot&lt;br /&gt;TH1GZY9 - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 53.959 W 074° 21.677&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead</groundspeak:long_description>

I wanted to pay my respects to Eik and Alan by coming here first but it was not to be so I come here on a half dollar miles stone..


Eik looks like a handsome and smart dog which his training exemplifies.  The cache was fun and I too followed the blue trail on this wonderful fall day.  Very much enjoyed this vista near the. cache. When I emerged from the woods there were 12 dogs running around the lawn up here.  Some of the dogs needed the exercise.


Exchanged TBs

Thanks for placing and maintaining this cache Alan.

Pugnuts have been fixing up their house and getting it ready for
the final sale.  Then, it is off to the nice warm &quot;Peach
State&quot; for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that we all collect so much
&quot;junk&quot; in our homes that moving is not fun and no matter how much
we send ahead with the movers, there is always a ton of stuff (and
the dogs) that must be crammed into the car at the last
minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park and grab is a tribute to
them as good friends and a hope that their car can hold all that
last minute stuff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

1/5 today. 66 degrees and a gorgeous day for caching that I wasn't about to let go to waste. I had to come up into this area to do maintenance, so I did a few on the way home - this was the first. I pulled right up to it and grabbed it immediately.

&lt;p&gt;My dearest friends and great
caching companions, The Pugnuts (Mark and Lynnea), are moving to
Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past two years, Mark
and Lynnea have been great friends to everyone in the geocaching
community.  We have been very fortunate to have them as active
members of the NNJC.  They have always been there to help the
newbies, to explain a puzzle problem, and to volunteer at
events.  And, let us not forget the ceaseless activity as a
PAF to all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mark was never satisfied
to try to solve a puzzle and just let it go as unsolvable. 
Oh, no, no, no!  Instead, he would become an absolute
bulldog.  He would keep working at it for weeks.  He was
tenacious and never would quit.  I am sure that many of the
puzzle cache owners were totally relieved when he finally got the
solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Lynnea is one of those
geocachers that has been gifted with the ability to guess, from 50
feet away, where a cache is hidden.  She has been correct on
so many occasions that it is unbelievable.  That capability,
plus the tri-axial compass on the Oregon 450 is an unbeatable
combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, off they go to a
warmer climate and leave behind many good friends that will suffer
through another New Jersey winter as they bask in the Georgia
sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that it was only
fitting that we put out a cache in their honor. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;In Montville
Township, just at the junction of River Road and Church Lane are
the remains of the stone foundations of Josiah Zabriskie’s
Gristmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact date of
the construction of the gristmill is unknown, but it already
existed on property when it was purchased in 1781. It is probable
that the construction occurred around 1760. The mill was a small
structure with two runs of stones and an undershot water wheel
powered by the Rockaway River. The force of the running river
turned a paddle wheel which rotated a large mill-stone on a
bed-stone, and was used to grind grain into flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just across the
road from the mill was the home of Zabriskie family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinypic.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, all that
remains of the gristmill are some of the stones of the foundation
of the mill and the support for the water wheel. The old dirt roads
are now paved streets. Across the road from the remains of the mill
are the former Montville Township municipal building, the local
animal shelter, some ball fields, and the local recycling center.
The house on the corner River Road and Church Lane may well be home
of the Zabriskie family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to
preserve this 250 year-old historic site, the cache is NOT located
in or on the stone foundations. Please be respectful and do not
remove or disturb any components of the structure. Enjoy the
history!  NOTE: If you take the direct route you will get wet.&lt;/p&gt;

Parked next to the dam and walked along the pretty pond to near GZ.   I really enjoyed the pond it was very pleasant views especially with all the leaves in their fall colors.  The cache was well hidden in an obvious spot.  The hint was very helpful as I was in my work clothes and dress shoes. 

Returning to my car I saw the blue lights flashing next to my car.  Oh no!  What could have happened.  I casually walked over and walked up to one of Montville's finest.  He politely questioned my choice of parking spots and suggested that the next time I visit the pond to park on one of the side streets are risk having my car get 0 MPG.   I said that was probably a good idea and he said &quot;Bye Brian&quot; as I walked back to my car.  Overall the experience was quite humorous.

The cache is under rated as a 1/1 cache though as my grandmother could not get to the cache in a wheel chair and point to the obvious hiding location.  I think Biga800 may underrate caches a bit.  However, his hiding spots and hints are excellent and I greatly appreciate his efforts to place quality caches in Northern New Jersey.  This cache is well stocked with fun things!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A quick park and grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years I worked in Rockville Centre, Long Island and commuted from New Jersey.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the immensely terrible drive each day, I was constantly reminded by my co-workers that New York was the cultural center America.  Each day they touted the vast and bountiful access that “the city” provided to food, entertainment, the fine arts, music, literature and especially theater.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, each day while I was being exposed to this propaganda, I could barely keep from bursting out laughing because of the exotically nasal long Island accent.  It was so hard to keep a straight face when we were talking about “cult-cha”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So to prove them wrong, when you get this cache maybe you will be able to take the opportunity to see that culture is alive a well in the suburbs of North Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: You cannot park on Route 287 to get the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you back to a bygone era
when rail was king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just at the side of Johnsonburg road sits the
Allamuchy Freight Station built in 1906 to service the daily &quot;milk
run&quot; to New York City.  Local dairy farmers brought
milk-filled cans to the depot each day for transit by the Lehigh
&amp; Hudson River Railroad to the New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a few of these historic freight
stations that still remain standing in New Jersey.  The
railroad tracks that ran along the side of the station have long
since been removed and the 100+ year-old building had been left to
deteriorate for many years.  As you will see, it is now in the
process of being restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A historical footnote: On Labor Day weekend,
in 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his private train
re-routed to stop here for a for a luncheon visit with Lucy Mercer
Rutherford at the family mansion in Allamuchy.  The Rutherford
Mansion, consisted of 23 rooms built in 1903-1904 on a 1000 acre
tract.  The mansion is now commonly known as the Villa
Madonna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do NOT have to climb up on the deck or
move anything to make the find. The cache is clearly visible from
the right angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Allamuchy Freight Depot is listed on the
national and state registers of historic places:  NEW JERSEY,
WARREN COUNTY, Allamuchy Freight House, Rte. 612, Allamuchy,
#02001056, LISTED, 9/23/02&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

But i guess much easier now, when the gps works a little better without leaves and the place also less covered. First looked at the wrong place, than looked around and decided to do a more detailed search. And it was there, just very well blended in.

Trick or Treat!

I got a treat.

I walked here from the new Scrat's Stash cache.  It must have made me focused on the find as I saw it in 2 seconds!  2 seconds!  What was I looking at the last three times.  Very easy find today.  Pheww

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">History of Fair Lawn History records that the area we now call Fair
Lawn was originally part of a larger area inhabited by the native
tribe, Lenni-Lenapi. As Dutch fur traders made their way up the
Hackensack and Passaic Rivers to trade with the Hackinghaesaky
Indians of the Lenni-Lenape tribe, they established trading posts
driving the Lenni-Lenapi further West. After the capture of New
Amsterdam in 1664, England acquired title to the area. Land grants
were issued, though the settlers who received them were mainly
Dutch. The Dutch settlers brought with them their &quot;Flemish Colonial
Style&quot; of building, which can still be seen throughout the area.
The General of the Bergen Militia was Andrew Hopper, whose family
had settled in Fair Lawn in 1711 and had owned large tracts of land
in the area. Hopper Avenue was named in honor of his service. Fair
Lawn Known as &quot;Small Lots&quot; As the 19th Century progressed, the
large farms which had existed were sold and divided into smaller
lots. By 1861, there were about 80 homes, most of them farmhouses.
Fair Lawn became known as &quot;Small Lots&quot;. One of the farmhouses still
standing today is the Garret-Hopper-Bogert house built in the early
1800s, and two Terhune houses on Saddle River Road. The site of a
house built during this era by Henry Hopper, a Sheriff of Bergen
County, is commemorated by a monumemt and garden. This cache is
located neat that monument at one of the last farmsteads in Fair
Lawn stood on this site. The house built by Henry Hopper in 1855
was razed for road improvements in 1989. He was Sheriff and
Freeholder of Bergen County and served in the state legislature. In
1919 William M. Croucher, Sr., bought the farm and with his sons,
Percy, Clarence and William worked the land as a truck farm until
1953. Back when New Jersey was the Garden State. Nothing remains
now except a few trees and a road marker. &lt;br /&gt;

When Easter came around, her friend, who was 80 at the time asked me to take her to her grave so that she could place a Palm Cross at her grave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we pull into the cemetery and go to where I thought my aunt was. We are walking up and down and back and forth for about 5 or so minutes. One row over, there is a woman placing flowers at her loved ones grave. My aunts friend looks at me and says &quot;Did she move?&quot;  The woman looks up and replies &quot;God, I hope not&quot;.   I about fell over laughing and the other woman starts to laugh as well. Turns out we were one section down from where they are. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cords will lead you to within feet of where Dorsey Williams and Carol M Watson are resting. Once you find their marker, say Hi and then look in what would be the obvious.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, please be respectful to all and use stealth and or come back if there is a service going on.

Please do not follow my example.
I was in the area for an other stop and go cache to make the daily.
When this popped up went here first.
My map was showing more like a memorial park, then the cemetery, which is this place )Ms. Blonde i think it is not a secret, so can have it in my log).
Than the hunting took over the mind and i went for it, even do not like the cemetery caches at all.
It was upside , so i would say yes she moved.
Signed and placed it back to my best imagination as it might have been originally.
Shortly after the log i got an email from CO and we exchanged some after about the cache.
This happens, when you do not read the description, just download the coord and go.
I hope you excuse for this.
Visiting the place be respectful and there is no need to rip up anything there.

I guess it is 3rd to find. Unless the ftf of a par counted as one.
If yes please let me known.

block from this park. Over the years Cinders has been on many
walkies through many parks and had geocached with me a few
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew today he would have one last walkie, so we shared a steak
for lunch and then I brought him here one last time so he could
leave us with some good memories as his last thoughts. The park is
dog friendly and Cinders was able to get one last woof at a passing
puppy as we struggled to complete our stroll. Cinders and I went to
the vet shorty after his walkie here. I returned and placed this
memorial cache. In additional to all the other fond memories I have
of him I will always remember how happy he was to say woof to that
other dog. He was full of more energy for the 2 minutes encounter
than he had been for the last 2 months. Now I hope he is in some
better place: pain free, chasing squirrels and tennis balls and
waiting for the steaks to come off the grill.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It would have been the only one, if the new cache did not popped up in the area before this.
But once it was the original daily target, had to find it too.
Nice one. Was easy as was little out from the hide.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fungus has killed off about 90 percent of NJ state's bat
population, according to scientists in 2010, who conducted an
earlier count of hibernating bats. The devastation was shocking in
the largest hibernation spot for bats in New Jersey — Morris
County's Hibernia Mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 30,000 bats normally spend the winter, but a 2010
count found only about 1,700 alive — and many of those showed
signs of infection, said a principal zoologist with the state's
Endangered and Non-game Species Program.&quot;The results we had from
Hibernia Mine were certainly not good news,&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus, called white-nose syndrome for the whitish powder
that appears on the nose, ears and wing membrane of infected bats,
was first discovered on bats in New York in 2006. It has since been
linked to the deaths of more than a million bats in 11 states, from
New Hampshire to Virginia, and has also spread to Ontario, Canada.
The virus appears to be following the path of the Appalachian
Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is unprecedented and scary,&quot; said a bat researcher at a
local University. &quot;This wave has killed more mammals in the United
States than anything in recent memory. It is entirely possible it
could sweep all the way across the country to California, killing
millions more bats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that the widespread loss of bats has potential
ramifications for humans, since bats consume huge quantities of
bugs, including insects that damage crops or carry West Nile and
other potentially fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bat deaths come at a particularly bad time in New Jersey,
where mosquito control experts worry that the recent rains and
floods have created ample breeding grounds for mosquitoes that
could result in an unusually large mosquito population. A single
bat can consume more than 3,000 mosquitoes on a single summer
night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say all six species of bats that hibernate in New
Jersey — big brown, little brown, Indiana, northern
long-eared, small-footed and tri-colored or eastern pipistrelle
— have been affected by the fungus. &quot;If this keeps going, our
bat populations will disappear,&quot; Once the population drops so
dramatically, the genetic variability of the species goes down, and
they are more susceptible to a variety of illnesses.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are under pressure to quickly find a way to save the
remaining bats and stop the spreading to other states. &quot;There's not
a lot of evidence of any silver bullet that could work,&quot; said the
national white-nose syndrome coordinator with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. &quot;Part of the problem is we still don't know how
the fungal infection leads to death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running hypothesis among scientists is that the fungus
irritates hibernating bats in some way, making them act
erratically. They will emerge from their winter sleep, move about
their caves and sometimes even fly outside as if in search for food
— but all the activity causes them to burn through their fat
reserves so they are unable to survive the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists in affected states are discussing ways to help the
decimated bat population recover. They are testing various
fungicides, hoping to find one that might help bats recover without
harming them. New Jersey scientists, meanwhile, are considering
capturing several dozen infected bats, nursing them back to health,
then reintroducing them to a contaminated hibernation spot to see
if they have developed immunity to the mysterious disease. The
first signs of white-nose syndrome among bats in New Jersey in the
winter of 2008-09. The 2010 count confirmed fears that it would
decimate the population.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Hibernia Mine was one of the largest mines in NJ. It was comprised of many smaller mines, all being linked and accessed through a 4000 foot plus adit. An adit is a type of entrance to an underground mine which is horizontal or nearly horizontal. Adits are usually built into the side of a hill or mountain. This adit was so large that it needed a locomotive in order for the ore transport to be economical. This was handled by the Hibernia Underground railway, the only incorporated mine railway in NJ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While much is known about the Revolutionary War era signifigance of the iron mines of northern New Jersey, less information is available on the railroad that facilitated the movement of iron ore to market from 1863 until the early 1900's.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Accounts vary as to when the original tunnel was dug and when tracks were first put down, but it is believed that by 1898, the Hibernia Underground Railroad (H.U.R.R.) was &quot;an incorporated narrow gauge railway that went as far as 317 feet below the surface and traveled along an 1,800 foot long elevated trestle.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The H.U.R.R. is unique in at least one aspect. While it was not the first iron mining railroad built in New Jersey, it was the first and only one to travel inside a mountain, and while early colonists and legendary captured Hessian soldiers provided the underground labor in the 1700's, Italians and Hungarians were reported to work the mines, and thus load the rail cars, in 1879 and 1891 respectively.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mine itself had a succession of owners since it's beginning, the raiload also appears to have been held by various interests. Historians state that by the end of the useful mining of iron ore in New Jersey, two railroad companies had assumed control of the mine roalroads: the Central Railroad and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Today, the abandoned railroad tunnel is the state's largest hibernaculum which had once housed 30,000 bats, until recently Surveys have shown that the bat population has greatly deminished. (see Bat cave cache page)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The cache is a short walk along the trail leading to the cave, after you locate the cache stop by the mine and feel the cold draft of air coming out of the mine. Please be respectful in the area.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Unlike most suburban towns whose names have little or nothing to do
with reality, Glen Rock was actually settled around an enormous
rock left by retreating glaciers in a small valley (glen). 
&lt;p&gt;

 &quot;Glen Rock is named for a 570-ton boulder, deposited by a recent
glacier, that stands near Rock Road, the town's main street. The
rock had been called Pamachapura, or Stone from Heaven, by the
Delaware (Lenape) Indians, it served as a base for Indian signal
fires and later as a trail marker for colonists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;FN17R3A - Cache is located at N 40 57.ABC   W 74 08.DEF&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;A = there are 2 years on the honor roll.  subtract the largest from the smallest
B = the 2nd digit of the year on the plaque desribing the Pamachapura
C = the # of names on the honor roll ending in &quot;ski&quot;


D = the number of men with the last name of &quot;May&quot;
E = the number of the decade the time capsule on the south side of the rock will be opened
F = The last digit of the year the time capsule was burried - 1.

Cache is near red trail.  Final stage is in Park that is closed at night.</groundspeak:long_description>

Got the coord with some hesitation but decided to track it down.
Come it is a great placement. The park may be able to hold more if anyone would like to place some there.

I have even seen&lt;br/&gt;mountain bikes going through there. Trail is subject to runoff and&lt;br/&gt;could be a little muddy at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two terrain depends on your entry point into the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not go through any fencing or gates onto any private property.&lt;br/&gt;Please stay only within the park. Also, no need to go near tracks&lt;br/&gt;or near the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks go out to Ms.Blonde for the supplies and getting me into&lt;br/&gt;geocaching in the first place !! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 58.535 W 074° 08.495  </groundspeak:long_description>

2 to 5&quot; of rain yesterday.  

Parked at the end of McKinley.  Found the cache and looked at the stream which has lowered about a foot from its crest.  I didn't know how to get into the Park off of Rock so I walked out that way.  Came out on  Garden Ave.  Not much parking there though.  I decided to walk back to the car via Rock and Lincoln.  The cops turned me (a pedestrian) around at Manor and said I had to go back the way I came because of the storm damage.

By the time I got back to the car it was obvious most of the neighborhood was without power.  The only houses with power had generators (nice!)

Went to grocery store.  Lots of people buying bottled water.  Thanks for the cache and bringing me back here.

across when I accidentally left the yellow trail coming down from
High Mountain. I figured this location would be a good spot for the
cache when I was first here and the waterfall was in full power.
During times of low water you can easily explore the rock formation
that creates this unnamed waterfall. High Mountain Park Preserve
Acres Protected: 1153.7 Established: 1993 Owned and managed by: The
Nature Conservancy Wayne Township, State of New Jersey Why is This
Land Special? A natural oasis amid urban sprawl, unique High
Mountain Park is situated in the Preakness Range of the Watchung
Mountains. Rolling topography provides panoramic vistas, including
a stunning view of New York City from High Mountain's summit. The
preserve is one of the largest tracts of forested land in the
Piedmont region of northern New Jersey and encompasses a mixture of
woodlands and wetlands. Along with its open space value, the
preserve harbors rare and threatened wildlife and a globally
imperiled traprock (basalt) glade/outcrop community. Nine
ecological communities and 380 plant species, 18 of which are rare,
have been identified at the site. They include the globally
imperiled Torrey's mountain mint (Pycnanthemum torrei) and
basil-leaved mountain mint (Pycnanthemum clinopodioides), which,
along with narrow-leaved vervain (Verbena simplex), are also
classified as endangered by the state. Hazel dodder (Cuscuta
coryli), a state-imperiled plant, has been recorded as
well.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;AT13Z2V - campus parking spot (not Lot 6)&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 57.123 W 074° 12.025&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PK13Z2V - Parking near cache&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 58.778 W 074° 12.275&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RD13Z2V - Red Trailhead (South)&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 57.130 W 074° 12.014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RT13Z2V - Red Trail head (north)&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 58.768 W 074° 12.272</groundspeak:long_description>

The phrase is used both for the physical seal itself (which is kept by the United States Secretary of State), and more generally for the design impressed upon it. The Great Seal was first used publicly in 1782&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The obverse of the great seal is used as the national coat of arms of the United States. It is officially used on documents such as United States passports, military insignia, embassy placards, and various flags. As a coat of arms, the design has official colors; the physical Great Seal itself, as affixed to paper, is monochrome.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since 1935, both sides of the Great Seal have appeared on the reverse of the one-dollar bill. The Seal of the President of the United States is directly based on the Great Seal, and its elements are used in numerous government agency and state seals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE DEEP
VOLL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



The “Depe
Voll” ravine played a very prominent role in the history of
Wyckoff. It is likely that this natural wonder was created ... by a
melting glacier that pushed, scraped and carved thousands of tons
of rock and soil down the hill toward what is now Goffle Road. The
ancestors of the Lenape Indians are thought to have first settled
in the area about ten thousand years ago. The Lenapes called the
ravine “Muksukemuk,” and the original Dutch settlers of
the area called it “Diepte Voll” (later shortened to
“Depe Voll”), which according to some accounts
translates to “deep fall.” It certainly an apt
description of the waterfalls all along the
ravine.






&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




The 1876 Bergen
atlas noted it as “Cold Brook,” which it certainly is,
especially on hot summer days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The 1995 U.S. Geological Survey captioned it as “Deep
Brook.” To many Wyckoff residents, it is simply known as
“the ravine.” A Favorite of Walkers and Joggers Dutch
settlers arrived in northern New Jersey in larger numbers in the
eighteenth century, and the upper portion of the ravine at
Grandview Avenue was the site of a mill owned by the Blauvelt
family. There is the remnant of a stairway leading down from Ravine
Avenue into the ravine near the intersection of Ravine and
Grandview (although it is impassable and filled with posion
ivy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1809, Ravine Avenue was constructed along the northerly end of
the ravine to link Grandview Avenue to Goffle Road. Now a favorite
of walkers, joggers and children who walk to school, Ravine Avenue
between Lafayette and Grandview avenues is an excellent vantage
point from which to enjoy the ravine and the woods still remaining.
In the later part of the nineteenth century, Judge Preston
Stevenson, a gentleman farmer, took over the over portion of the
ravine from descendants of the Blauvelt family. His butter molds
were imprinted with “Depe Voll” in honor of the ravine.
Account of the Paterson Rambling Club, 1907 Because of its great
beauty, this beautiful deep gorge was the site of many excursions
by naturalists-botanists and geologists-and hundreds of students
over the last century. Joseph Rydings, the leader of the Paterson
Rambling Club, reporting on one excursion around 1907, wrote, The
Ramblers have known and visited [Deep Brook GIen] for years, and
its charms have been revealed at last to many lovers of Nature
outside the Rambling Club. Man may thirst for fame, but Sylvan
Nature is a shy, retiring maiden who wants no intrusion on her
solitude, and though the poet seems to pity the flower that is born
to blush unseen, the flower itself may be supposed to rejoice in
such a condition. These thoughts occupied the mind of one of the
Ramblers last Sunday, as he wandered through the glen, bemoaning
the disappearance of the old woodland favorites, which Flora had
cherished and cultivated in this sequestered spot ever since the
Red Man dwelt within the grove. The wintergreen plant, once so
common here, is almost extinct. [Note: Wintergreen was still to be
found in the Ravine as recently as the 1950s.] [In the south] we
...passed through meadows watered by the sprightly little Goffle
Brook, until we came to the beginning of the enchanted delI which
goes by the name of Deep-Brook GIen. Here the Ramblers were met by
Mr. Van Blarcum, who welcomed them and gave them full permission to
wander over his own grounds…. In this way the Ramblers went
on until the end of the ravine was reached. Here the woodland path
gives place to the public highway [Grandview Avenue ]. Boy Scout
excursions have searched for—and found—arrowheads in
the ravine. For many long-time residents of Wyckoff, it was the
site where many summer afternoons were spent. After a heavy rain,
the sight and sound of the huge flood of water that runs through
the ravine is spectacular. The ravine is truly one of North
Jersey’s greatest sites,(some say it is) rivaled only by
Paterson’s Great Falls, and it has brought both joy and awe
to the faces of (those) who seen it. We have squandered much of
this natural wonder, which is why, now more than ever, it is
important to protect what remains for future generations to enjoy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




UPDATE: DO NOT APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHSIDE OF
THE RAVINE AS YOU WILL BE TRESSPASSING AND CAN RISK LIFE OR LIMB!!!
 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't cross the water when in the ravine. Do not tresspass. Nice
place to take photographs is the bridge that you will walk past if
you park at waypoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see the signs to the right to not enter
there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Largest tree N-side of ravine.  On the ravine side of the tree is a single rock that looks really out of place next to the roots. You will be at a location that you can not be seen from the road but actually not in the Raveine.  At that point you may lichen to move the rock.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Dr. Sir: I have the pleasure to inform your
Excellency, that the measures concerted for quelling the mutiny in
the Jersey line were this morning carried into full execution. The
mutineers were unexpectedly surrounded and awed into an
unconditional surrender with little hesitation and no resistance.
Two of the principal actors were executed on the&lt;br /&gt;
spot, the rest pardonned. The spirit of mutiny seems now to have
completely subsided and to have given place to a genuine
repentance. This was very far from being the case previous to this
step, notwithstanding the apparent submission which the assurances
of redress had produced; they still continued insolent and
refractory and disobedient to the commands of
theirofficers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;A general pardon was promised by Colonel
Dayton, on condition of an immediate and full return to duty. This
condition was not performed on the part of the mutineers and of
course they were not entitled to the benefit of the promise;
besides which the existence of the Army called for an example. I
have the honor etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To General
Robert Howe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;Sir: You are to take the command of the detachment, which
has been ordered to march from this post against the mutineers of
the Jersey line. You will rendezvous the whole of your command at
Ringwood or Pompton as you find best from circumstances. The object
of your detachment is to compel the mutineers to unconditional
submission, and I am to desire you will grant no terms while they
are with arms in their hands in a state of resistance. The manner
of executing this I leave to your discretion according to
circumstances. If you succeed in compelling the revolted troops to
a surrender you will instantly execute a few of the most active and
most incendiary leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will endeavour to collect such of the Jersey troops to your
standard as have not followed the pernicious example of their
associates, and you will also try to avail yourself of the services
of the Militia, representing to them how dangerous to civil liberty
the precedent is of armed soldiers dictating terms to their
country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You will open a
correspondence with Colonels Dayton and Shreve of the Jersey line
and Col Freelinghousen of the Militia or any
others.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
-- G.
Washington&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1732, Robert Howe was born in Brunswick County, North
Carolina. He emerged as the colonies’ highest-ranking officer
during the Revolutionary War. In November 1786, Howe died at his
home in Brunswick County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His military career began in 1754, when appointed Captain of the
Bladen County militia. In 1756, Howe was appointed Justice of the
Peace and was elected to represent Bladen County in the General
Assembly from 1760 to 1775.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the General Assembly, Howe and Royal Governor William
Tryon established a friendship. In 1761, Tryon appointed Howe to
the Supreme Court for the Wilmington District, and in 1766, to the
Court of Exchequer. From 1765 to 1767 and from 1769 to 1773, Howe
commanded Fort Johnston. During the 1760s, Governor Tryon called on
Howe and his Fort Johnston troops to put down the Regulator
Rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1770s, Royal Governor Josiah Martin and Howe
frequently disagreed. In 1771, Martin replaced Governor Tryon and
shortly afterward removed Howe from the Court of Exchequer; in
1773, he relinquished Howe of command of Fort Johnston. The
attachment clause controversy further divided Howe and Martin. The
provincial government deplored the attachment clause, which allowed
creditors to “attach property owned in North Carolina by
non-residents . . . to satisfy their debts.” Governor Martin
supported the decision to remove the clause, but colonial lawmakers
were determined to keep the law intact. While leading the movement
to keep the attachment clause, Howe associated with the Sons of
Liberty and the American struggle for independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s General Assembly met in 1773 and established a
Committee of Correspondence. Howe was one of nine committee members
assigned to investigate Parliamentary Acts that “may relate to or
effect the British Colonies in America.” The Committee reported
their findings to all colonies and united the fight for America’s
freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1775, Howe trained the Brunswick County militia, received a
colonel’s appointment, and assumed command of the Second North
Carolina Continentals. Howe led his 428 officers and men to
Norfolk, Virginia to reinforce Colonel William Woodford’s army,
then battling Lord Dunmore. He assumed command of the American
troops and defeated Lord Dunmore. Although Howe had proved his
military prowess, the Second North Carolina Regiment disbanded
shortly after the battle in Norfolk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Howe was appointed military advisor for North
Carolina’s Provincial Congress. In 1777, he led North Carolina
troops to meet Major General Charles Lee, commander of the Southern
Department. Now a major general, Howe was the highest ranking North
Carolinian in the Continental Army. When General Lee left the
Southern Department, James Moore assumed command. However, in the
spring of 1777, Moore was ordered to North Carolina and Howe became
Commander of the Southern Department and the highest-ranking
officer in the South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Commander of the Southern Department, Howe was to defend the
southern colonies. In the summer of 1778, Howe led the Continentals
to the Georgia-Florida border to attack the British troops at St.
Augustine, Florida. Fearing defeat, Howe urged Congress to abandon
the campaign. But Congress persisted. After several months of
chasing the British, Howe retreated northward. The campaign in
Florida was disastrous for Howe. His inability to unify command
undermined American ability to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howe’s reputation was tarnished by his defeat in Florida, so he
desperately wanted to prove his worth. He led the troops of the
Southern Department to defend Savannah, Georgia. Howe lost the city
in December 1778, however, after a surprise attack by
Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell. Soon after, all of Georgia
fell to the British and Howe was relieved as commander of the
Southern Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1779, Howe served with General George Washington on
the Hudson, commanded troops protecting the Connecticut border at
Ridgefield, and in 1780, commanded Fort West Point. Although
Congress appointed him in 1785 as part of a commission to negotiate
the land in Ohio with western Indians, Howe returned to North
Carolina, where the General Assembly passed a resolution thanking
him for his devotion to the state. In hopes of gaining a state
legislative seat, Howe campaigned in Brunswick County, but in
November 1786, he suffered a fever and died.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Col. Israel Shreve: 
&lt;p&gt;

&quot;Dr. Sir: With not less pain than you communicate it, I receive the
information contained in your letter of yesterday. This affair, if
possible, must be brought to an issue favourable to subordination,
or the army is ruined. I shall therefore immediately march a
detachment from these posts to quell the mutineers. Col
Freelinghuyssen will impart to you what I have written to him. In
addition to that, I am to desire you will endeavour to collect all
those of your regiments who have had virtue enough to resist the
pernicious example of their associates. If the revolt has not
become general, and if you have force enough to do it, I wish you
to compel the mutineers to unconditional submission. The more
decisively you are able to act the better. I am

Dear General
Washington,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is with pain that I inform Your Excellency
that the troops at this place revolted this evening, and have
marched towards Trenton: their behavior and demands are similar to
those of the Pennsylvania Line; though no blood has been spilt. I
was informed by a woman of their intentions, late this afternoon,
and immediately ordered all the men off duty to be paraded; with an
intention to detach them in different parties for the night; but
found but very few that would turn out. I was amongst them for some
time but could not prevail upon them to desist. They have lately
received a part of the depreciation of their pay, and most of them
are much disguised with liquor. Col. Frelinghauyen, one of the
Commissioners of the State is now here.&quot; --&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This eyewitness account is from the diary of James Thacher,
M.D., a surgeon in the Continental Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 March on the (January 27th,
1781) at one o'clock, a.m., eight miles, which brought us in view
of the insurgent soldiers at dawn of day. Here we halted for an
hour to make the necessary preparations. Some of our soldiers
suffered much anxiety lest the soldiers would not prove faithful on
this trying occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orders were given to
load their arms - they obeyed with alacrity, and
indications were given that they were to be relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being paraded in a
line, General Howe harangued them, representing the heinousness of
the crime of mutiny, and the absolute necessity of military
subordination, adding that the mutineers must be brought to terms
of compromise, while in a state of resistance. Two fieldpieces were
ordered to be placed in view of the insurgents, and the troops were
ordered to surround the huts on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Howe then
ordered his aide-de-camp to command the mutineers to appear on
parade in front of their huts unarmed, within five minutes;
observing them to hesitate, a second messenger was sent, and they
instantly obeyed the command, and they paraded in line without arms
being in number between two and three hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding themselves
closely encircled and unable to resist, they quietly submitted to
the fate which awaited them. General Howe ordered that three of the
ringleaders should be selected as victims for condign punishment.
These unfortunate culprits were tried on the spot. Colonel Sprout
being president of the court martial, standing on the snow, and
they were ordered to be immediately shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most
guilty mutineers were next selected to be their executioners. This
was a most painful task; and when ordered to load, some of them
shed tears. The wretched victims, overwhelmed by the terrors of
death, had neither time nor power to implore the mercy and
forgiveness of their God, and such was their agonizing condition,
that no heart could refrain from emotion of sympathy and
compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first that
suffered was a sergeant (David Gilmore) and an old offender; he was
led a few yards distance and place on his knees; six of the
executioners, at a signal given by an officer, fired, three aiming
at the head and three at the breast, the other six reserving their
fire in order to dispatch the victim should the first fire fail. It
so happened in this instance; the remaining six then fired and life
was instantly extinguished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second criminal
was, by the first fire, instantly sent into eternity. The third,
being less criminal, by the recommendation of his officers, to his
unspeakable joy, received a pardon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tragical scene
produced a dreadful and salutary effect on the minds of the guilty
soldiers. Never were men more completely humbled and penitent;
tears of sorrow and of joy rushed from their eyes, and each seemed
to congratulate himself that his forfeited life had been
spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then commanded
them to ask pardon of their officers, and promise to devote
themselves to the faithful discharge of their duties as soldiers in
future. It is most painful to reflect, that circumstances should
imperiously demand the infliction of capital punishment on soldiers
who have more than a shadow of plea to extenuate their crime. These
unfortunate men have long suffered many serious grievances which
them have sustained with commendable patience; but have, at length
lost their faith in public justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of the
Pennsylvania insurgents undoubtedly encourage them to hope for
exemption from punishment. But the very existence of an army
depends on proper discipline and subordination. The arm of
authority must be exerted, and public examples be exhibited to
deter from the commission of crimes. The spirit of revolt must be
effectually repressed, or a total annihilation of the army is
inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir Henry Clinton,
on this occasion, had his hopes again excited; ever ready to profit
by treachery or revolt, he dispatched an emissary to encourage the
insurrection and to make the most tempting offers to induce the
mutineers to desert, and join the British standard; but the
messenger himself frustrated his hopes by delivering the papers to
our own
officers.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Chirp cache. Drive to the parking lot. If you do not
have &quot;chirp&quot; capabilities, please contact me for an alternate
puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CHIRP compatible device is needed for this cache. The cache is
not at the icon location but a walk around this location with a
CHIRP enabled device will soon pick up the final coordinates. Not
all GPSs can find this cache; only Garmins and only Garmin Dakota
20, GPSMAP62’s, GPSMAP78’s, Oregon 300-550’s. If
you don't have one of the listed GPS units, soon the iphone will
have an APP that can pick up it's signal. If you do have the
correct Garmin, make sure it is updated using the Garmin web
Updater online. Once updated, set it up to receive Chirps under the
geocaching program. Please don't look for the chirp, it is not
meant to be found. If you do find it...it will do you no good. It
can only be programed by the GPS which initially programmed it and
is useless to anyone else. You can read up on the Chirp by going
online to Garmin's website and searching for Chirps. Happy caching
and good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2JJCE - GC2JJCE Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TH2JJCE - Red Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 01.077 W 074° 44.237</groundspeak:long_description>

I asked the CO &quot;what is this opencache things and he gave me a nice introductory of of it.
Than he refused just give direction (i guess this is how it is to be done) but helped me out with the coordinate, if i register after on the site.
Took sometime, but here it is now.
And i was the first to sign the log too. So first opencache with the FTF.
This should be a great start.</groundspeak:text>

The cliff that it is perched on looks out over several hundred acres of lake, marsh and wild wetlands.  There is a rough hewn half log bench at the top and the views are very nice.  I have been to this park many times over the years and have only seen about 3 other people.  Given that very few people visit here it provides some nice solitude and a great overlook.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The &quot;Ghost of Muskshaw&quot;  was like looking for a ghost! It was very clever and so well hidden, we gave up after 30 minutes. We came back on our way out, and  after searcing for the other OC in the preserve.  We perservered and it paid off!. It was one of the best caches I have found in a long time. The CO deserves a well done!

There are so many beautiful locations in the Muckshaw Preserve, from cool lake vistas, nice woodland areas, and lots rocky outcrops. The trails are all very nice and well maintained .  

We were very surprised to find a blank log book, A Co- FTF, was a real bonus. 

The &quot;bonus&quot; cache hike took us to some equally interesting areas of the preserve too, it took alot of searching too, with a lot of cool large boulders and many areas to hide a cache.

TFTC It was an enjoyable cache outing!

&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Graupel (also called snow pellets) refers to precipitation that
forms when supercooled droplets of water condense on a snowflake,
forming a 2–5 mm ball of rime ice; the snowflake acts as a nucleus
of condensation in this process. The term is derived from
German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under some atmospheric conditions, forming and descending snow
crystals may encounter and pass through atmospheric supercooled
cloud droplets. These droplets, which have a diameter of about 10
µm, can exist in the unfrozen state down to temperatures near
-40°C. Contact between the snow crystal and the supercooled
droplets results in freezing of the liquid droplets onto the
surface of the crystals. This process of crystal growth is known as
accretion and may happen in the clouds or when there is freezing
fog. Crystals that exhibit frozen droplets on their surfaces are
referred to as rimed. When this process continues so that the shape
of the original snow crystal is no longer identifiable, the
resulting crystal is referred to as graupel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
The series is based on the 1951 International Commission on Snow
and Ice classification system. The commission produced a fairly
simple and widely used classification system for solid
precipitation. This system defines the seven principal snow crystal
types as plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, spatial
dendrites, capped columns, and irregular forms. To these are added
three additional types of frozen precipitation: graupel, ice
pellets, and hail. The classification is the least complicated in a
series of snow classification systems. The most complex
classification scheme, an extension of Ukichiro Nakaya's work, was
published by meteorologists C. Magono and C. W. Lee in 1966. Their
system included 80 different snow crystal types. Twenty years ago I
used the international classification in an Independent Physics
Field Study where I observed snowflakes for the winter and
developed correlations with surface and lower atmospheric
conditions. Today, the classification system is used here to find
structures in nature that look similar to the snow referenced in
the cache name.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK185FZ - southern approach parking area&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 02.077 W 074° 17.123&lt;br /&gt;Park here.  Look for indian heads and follow red triangle trail up the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache was very well hidden and we searched for quite a while. Honestly, I was ready to quit when something caught my eye and we made the find.  The &quot;chirp&quot; is still active and it beamed the location of the &quot;bonus&quot; cache.  Soon were were off to grab it.  We did get that also.

&lt;p&gt;Stellar crystals are born at temperatures near -15 degrees C,
and are among the most common type of snowflakes. They are as
delicate as they look because large flakes tend to become broken by
wind and midair collisions with other crystals. Under ideal
conditions several stars my join to form large snowflakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
The series is based on the 1951 International Commission on Snow
and Ice classification system. The commission produced a fairly
simple and widely used classification system for solid
precipitation. This system defines the seven principal snow crystal
types as plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, spatial
dendrites, capped columns, and irregular forms. To these are added
three additional types of frozen precipitation: graupel, ice
pellets, and hail. The classification is the least complicated in a
series of snow classification systems. The most complex
classification scheme, an extension of Ukichiro Nakaya's work, was
published by meteorologists C. Magono and C. W. Lee in 1966. Their
system included 80 different snow crystal types. Twenty years ago I
used the international classification in an Independent Physics
Field Study where I observed snowflakes for the winter and
developed correlations with surface and lower atmospheric
conditions. Today, the classification system is used here to find
structures in nature that look similar to the snow referenced in
the cache name. However, this cache is placed with a stellar
view.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;00185GC - southern approach parking area&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 02.077 W 074° 17.123&lt;br /&gt;Park here.  Look for indian heads and follow red triangle trail until it intersects with orange trail going north.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The most common snow crystals by far are the irregular crystals.
These are small, usually clumped together, and show little of the
symmetry seen in stellar or columnar crystals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This cache is at the trailhead which
leads to a hilly forest that is a sanctuary for wildlife. Hikers
and mountain bikers enjoy miles of challenging trails. Many trails
offer a view of the New York City skyline. Birdwatchers are
attracted to the forest for its ponds, streams and marshes that
provide the perfect habitat for bird and other wildlife species.
The forest borders the Ramapo Mountain Reservation, which is part
of the Bergen County Park System.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;br /&gt; 



&lt;strong&gt;Ramapo Lake Natural Area&lt;/strong&gt;
(1,417 acres)
&lt;p&gt;This natural area offers spectacular views from
numerous rock outcroppings and ledges and rewards those who accept
the challenge of the winding hiking trails and rocky terrain that
comprise most of the site. A 120-acre clearwater mountain lake
provides an excellent spot for fishing and birdwatching. There is
no swimming permitted in this lake. The area is open every day from
8 am to 8 pm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;Trails&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system of marked hiking and multi use trails
are available for the public to explore. These trails offer
visitors opportunities to hike interior woodlands and rocky
vistas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The multi use trails are suitable for hiking, mountain biking, and
cross country skiing. Please obey all designated uses of the
trails, posted at the trail heads and trail crossings. For
information on mountain biking and volunteer opportunities please
visit the Ramapo
Valley Cycling Club Web site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Please note that trail difficulty ratings are opinion only. All
trail mileages represent only the portion of the trail that goes
through Ramapo Mountain State Forest, and complete trail lengths
could be longer, therefore a topgraphical trail map is recommended
for navigation of the trails. Maps may be purchased in the office
(973-962-7031) o Ringwood
State Parkr through the New York - New Jersey Trail
Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Ice Pellets or Sleet&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In American usage, sleet is a form of precipitation consisting
of frozen raindrops or refrozen partially melted snowflakes, also
known as ice pellets. In order for the snow flakes to significantly
melt, the temperature aloft needs to rise a few degrees Celsius
above the melting point. However, if the subfreezing layer below
the warm layer is too narrow, freezing rain will be the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the temperature and moisture
concentrations the various types of snowflakes for at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series is based on the 1951 International Commission on Snow
and Ice classification system. The commission produced a fairly
simple and widely used classification system for solid
precipitation. This system defines the seven principal snow crystal
types as plates, stellar crystals, columns, needles, spatial
dendrites, capped columns, and irregular forms. To these are added
three additional types of frozen precipitation: graupel, ice
pellets, and hail. The classification is the least complicated in a
series of snow classification systems. The most complex
classification scheme, an extension of Ukichiro Nakaya's work, was
published by meteorologists C. Magono and C. W. Lee in 1966. Their
system included 80 different snow crystal types. Twenty years ago I
used the international classification in an Independent Physics
Field Study where I observed snowflakes for the winter and
developed correlations with surface and lower atmospheric
conditions. Today, the classification system is used here to find
structures in nature that look similar to the snow referenced in
the cache name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;00186X6 - Parking and NYNJ Trailhead (not the closest)&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 03.255 W 074° 15.797&lt;br /&gt;Designated and LEGAL! parking for Blue Trail Head.

Maybe it was there to pump water to the snow blowing equipment on the ski slope.

I wanted to stretch my legs on this fine February morning.  This was a great cache to start the hike in 6&quot; of powder.  Despite the snow this was an easy find.

It appears that young Wjgrun has been playing with matches (again) and smoking as well.  Oh, my!  Oh, my!  Something had to be done. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wjgrun’s matches were reported lost and we had to find them.  But, we suspected that our good friend and stellar cacher, Weathernowcast, had taken the matches and hidden them to keep Wjgrun from smoking.  So, it was our mission to find those matches and make sure that they were safely hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, we found the matches.  But, imagine our surprise when we found that Wjgrun had a secret ashtray.  It had to be moved.  So, we took the ashtray and placed it on a bookshelf elsewhere in the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you please find Wjgrun’s ashtray and make sure that it is safely hidden?.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE:&lt;br/&gt;Norvin Green State Forest is teeming with wildlife: deer, bears, snakes, small animals and ticks.  The trails are well marked but some of the slopes and rocks can be challenging.  Please use care and be aware of your surroundings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good caching…..</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This
     truely
     is a
     
special
place,
nestled in the center of Newark's 35,000-acre
Pequannock
Watershed, one of
New Jersey's few remaining relatively unspoiled wildernesses, yet
only 40 miles from
New
York
City.

The cache is placed on a cozy little overlook
with inch deep moss whih should make the search all the more
rewarding on tired feet.  The moss covered exposed
bedrock would be a nice place to sit back and
relax a bit or a soft spot for
bears.  
A visit here in any season
will be rewarding. The trails are so empty that you will likely see
more bear then hikers and
sounderused that the moss
underfoot softens your step on much of your
path. There is always something of interest for every
outdoors person. Winter, with its spectacle of ice and snow, is a
photographer's delight. Winter finches (pine siskins,
crossbills, redpolls, and
grosbeaks) in flight years often frequent the many conifers that
dot the landscape. During these frigid months that feature colors
of white and brown, a botanist is not at a loss to find something
green, since lichens, mosses, club mosses, and evergreen
ferns
abound.&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;March heralds the end of
winter and the hope of spring. The sight of skunk
cabbage peaking through the soil is the first sign of
the season. The vanguard of the passerine bird movement north is
the eastern phoebe proudly
announcing itself along
Clinton Road's many streams. Warmer days
feature Compton tortoise shell and
mourning cloak
butterflies as well as stone flies dotting the many
rocks and bridges. Clinton Reservoir, when not frozen, serves as an
excellent stop-off spot for ducks and loons on their journey north.
Coltsfoot wins the award for the first flower of the season,
blooming in late March or early April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The melting
snow provides copious quantities of that precious clear
liquid that supplies the many streams welcoming the Louisiana
Waterthrushes back in April. Cinnamon and sensitive
ferns almost blanket the moist areas, where
salamanders can be found with
some searching. Kinglets and yellow-rumped warblers are plentiful
as they wend their way north. May and June are the months most
folks look forward to for wildflowers, spring migration, and,
ultimately, the breeding season (for birds).&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;gt;The breeding season is
something special here--over 140 species have been recorded in the
&quot;watershed&quot; on various surveys taken over the last 20 years.
Clinton road alone has registered 25 species of warblers in June
and early July. Nesting
raptors are also a specialty of the area.
Owls include Great-horned, barred, and
saw-whet , and hawks include goshawk, broad-winged, and
red-shouldered (the best location in New Jersey for this declining
species).&lt;br /&gt;
Summer is the season to

explore the
many trails that
find their origin along Clinton Road,
where with luck, mammals such
asblack
bear, river otter, beaver, porcupine, and
red and
gray
foxes may be found.
But beware, timber
rattlesnakes have are also present in the
areas.  A visit here is most pleasant at this time of
the year, with mountain laurel blanketing the landscape and
assorted berries to provide a fine dessert for a picnic lunch.
Thirty-five species of ferns bring joy to &quot;fernatic's&quot; hearts, and
the abundant wildflowers are ample fodder for any nature
photographer. &amp;lt;/&amp;gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Autumn,
with its brilliant displays of changing foliage, renders
this &lt;i&gt;the place to
be&lt;/i&gt;, especially during
mid-October, but a visit anytime is worthwhile. To truly enjoy the
experience of Clinton Road, take a closer look.

Buy a permit and parking sticker and find out
why many of this state'sfinest
naturalists consider this one of their favorite haunts
and why this area must be preserved for future
enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you hike along the Blue
Trail from the Stephens Road trailhead you soon come to the rocky
remains of what is thought to be an old furnace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of large
stones is quite beautiful and one can only imagine what the
original must have looked like.  I wonder how those large
stones and rocks were put into position and how many hours it took
to construct.  What was it used for? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little further down the
trail there appears to be the remains of another small
structure.  Some cachers have referred to it as a
&quot;charcoaler's hut.&quot;  Maybe so.  I wanted to draw your
attention to these old structures during your hike.  But, the
cache is NOT in or near either of them. &lt;/p&gt;

After seeing 5 bears yesterday and having the trail blocked by a sixth bear I returned for more photographic opportunities and to find a few caches.  This was a great hiding spot but I had to sign the log with a stick as my pen had run try and their was not a writing utensil in the cache. This lonely cache was in fine shape.  Thanks for placing it so close to the trail.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today I hiked on the Blue Trail
from Stephens Road north to the Bearfort Mountain cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike was about 1.3 miles along
a beautiful old woods road with very little terrain
change&lt;/p&gt;
  There were many picturesque
locations and several great places to stash a cache.  I
wondered why the the Bearfort Cache had not been found in 10 months
or so.  I thought that adding a cache or two to the area would
help to bring some cachers to this area.
&lt;p&gt;As I walked, I saw the &quot;Three
Sisters&quot; and I remembered a famous Three Sisters Restaurant in
Georgia.  I thought about the Three Sisters Stables which is
near where I live, and I was inspired to put a cache
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy.  Just a feet
off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is at P8 at the gate on
Stephens Road.  Just a short hike (uphill) until you reach the
blue trail.  The terrain rating is based on the uphill walk,
otherwise the cache would be rated at 2.0 x 1.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2W266 - Parking at P8&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 06.432 W 074° 24.458</groundspeak:long_description>

I returned today after experiencing a lot of bears yesterday. 


This cache reminded me about a French film about three sisters.  One was round, one was square and the other was a bit peculiar.  This one turned out that I was able to make the find quickly.  By this time of my hike all writing utensils were not working so I signed the log with a stick (that works well by the way).

Thanks Al for placing a cache out here.  The Mountain Laurel are at their peak!</groundspeak:text>

To obtain the true coordinates (minutes) for this cache you must first solve the puzzle.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking: If you solve the clues correctly parking will be self-evident. This is not a mutli-cache in the true sense of the word because coordinates are not needed for the second &quot;leg&quot; if the second part of the puzzle is solved. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Cache Size/Description: The geocache is small, almost a micro, but it can accommodate trackable geocoins and maybe a patch. There are pencils, and a log in the cache. Depending on the day and time there may be a lot of Muggles around... be stealthy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use care when removing the cache because it fits in only one direction...do not force out. If you have the right position it will come out easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;FTF: The first to find will find a $20.00 bill in the cache for him&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essential Read - A Brief Bio of Isaac Newton &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To solve the first part (Leg One) of this puzzle you will need to know a little about the life of Sir Isaac Newton. For the second part of the puzzle (Leg Two) you will need to know a little about Galileo, although you'll need to research the nexus on your own. &lt;br/&gt;As a young man Isaac Newton attended Cambridge University.  In 1665 Cambridge was forced to shut down as a result of an outbreak of bubonic plague. Newton had to return home to his native village of Lincolnshire.  While at home he would frequent a nearby garden at Woolsthorpe Manor, to quietly meditate on the mysteries of the universe.  As the legend goes, on one of his outings to this garden, Newton observed an apple fall from a nearby apple tree. He had an epiphany! Newton realized that the force that caused the apple to fall &quot;down&quot; to the ground was the very same force that kept the moon in its orbit around the Earth.  This idea was a revolutionary concept, but he faced a dilemma. Newton realized that it would require a mathematical proof to demonstrate that his idea was in fact correct. However, the mathematics of his day was not sufficient to prove his ideas. It would take a much more sophisticated mathematics to show that his &quot;Law of Gravity&quot; was indeed correct.  Newton then spent the next twenty years of his life &quot;inventing&quot; the necessary mathematical tools to demonstrate that his ideas were right. Have you figured out what he had to invent?  What an amazing mind!  The only other person who might have compared with Newton's capacity as a genius might have been the ancient Greek Mathematician Archimedes, who was born some 1,929 years before Newton's birth. Certainly there hasn't been anyone who truly measured up to Newton's genius after his time, not even Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity compares to Newton's accomplishments. Pay close attention to the clues that follow since these are all you will get to solve this puzzle.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two legs to this puzzle.  All the information necessary to solve this puzzle is contained in the clues associated with each Leg.  Read them carefully.  If you do the solution is really not all that hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leg One (Clues)-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clue 1: This first leg is &quot;integral&quot; to solving the mystery of this geocache.  Like so many caches that have been hidden in deep woods, this cache also involves a natural log. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clue 2: This next clue will test the “limits” of the geocacher's prowess.  I am alpha (7.491675) and omega (10.48449777), the first and last the bright and morning star. Once you understand this clue the solution will be had in minutes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clue 3: The throne of alpha is in the north, while omega's is in the west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have finished Leg One it will bring you to the location to begin Leg Two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leg Two (Clues)- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've completed Leg One, you must then consider the following riddle: The wanderer hath ears to hear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From this point take six (or seven) paces due south.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Source Mike Schwartz Nov 1993  at(http://cohp.org/nj/new_jersey.html#Passaic)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 points around Terrace Pond that are &amp;gt; 1480 feet above m.s.l.  Over the years one or another have been considered the Passaic County High Point.  Currently, many consider all six tied for the honor and all six are higher then the official &quot;benchmark&quot; to the east of Terrace Pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the six this one is the easiest to reach and is located close to two other &quot;high points.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the white trail south along the west side of the pond (not the longer route along the east side), and bear uphill to the right on the signed red trail. When this trail crests and is clearly starting downhill, bushwhack generally north along the ridge line. Almost immediately reach a clump of at least three knobs, the highest of which is the southernmost of three highpoints. Look for a cairn about 50 feet to the Northeast of the cache.  The highest point on this outcropping is located at (41° 8.212' N, 74° 23.865' W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For extra credit (but no caches as the 528 rule applies to the multi that starts north of here)the another high point can be found 162 feet to the north of the cache at (41° 8.234' N, 74° 23.872' W) Continue almost due north to another knob topped by a nice, sit-down-for-lunch-sized boulder, with a cairn nearby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are done having lunch checkout the third nob in the area at 167 feet to the northeast of the cache at  (41° 8.233' N, 74° 23.847' W): Backtrack to the southernmost point and strike a little north of east to the tiny easternmost point. You will have passed this point on the way uphill, but it's not obvious. Look for an orange blaze on top and a grand view east to the New York City skyline, some 45 miles away, haze permitting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to put caches on the other three high points in the Passaic County which are located north of Terrace Pond:  GOOD LUCK!! as there are no trails near them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HI13W97 - High Point #2 South of Terrace Pond&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 08.234 W 074° 23.872&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HP13W97 - High Point #1 South of Terrace Pond&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 08.212 W 074° 23.865&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PT13W97 - High Point #3 South of Terrace Pond&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 08.233 W 074° 23.847&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

47 deg F sunny

2&quot; of snow on north face of hill and trail
No snow on southside of hill.

Took yellow trail.  No one had walked on it since the snow from several weeks ago. No tracks on the trail is always fun.

Got to the cache.  What a great spot!! Nice view. Cool erratic and a great cache full of stuff.

Out hiding 4 caches today on th theory giving is better than receiving.

Happy New Year Kane!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is at an outcropping that, at just under 800 ft MSL,  has a beautiful view east overlooking the Wanaque Mountains surrounding Wanaque Reservior.     Though Wanaque and Monksville Reserviors area close by they are hidden by the hills surrounding them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems others have found a different way into the woods.  I still prefer my original directions since it will cause no problems. My way is only .2 mi longer.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park your car at the entrance to Green Turtle Pond off Awosting Rd.  Leaving the Green Turtle Pond entrance turn right and cross Awosting Rd (there are several homes on Awosting Rd. opposite the Green Turtle Pond entrance) heading north up Awosting Rd. walk around 100-150 ft north on  Awosting Rd., and immediately past the last house there is an ATV trail, next to the driveway of the last house, heading west into the woods.   Walk up the ATV trail a short way and past a large oak tree (more towards your right) that fell down almost across the trail.  There are usually large puddles in this area I walk around using one of the drier ATV trails.   Just past the fallen tree take the very first ATV trail heading left (south) behind the backyards of the homes on Awosting Rd.  The woods are crisscrossed with ATV trails.  Use your GPS to keep you heading generally south (my GPS initially showed southeast, eventually shifting more south and southwest).  The ATV trail splits at several points, but often they rejoin, so you might not take the exact route I walk to get to the outcrop.  At about 0.4 mi. the trail Ys and the right leg  heads up a pretty steep hill.  Take this route up the steep hill. Climb all the way to the top, and keep along the ATV trails always heading in a south direction.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocache is located at what I call the Wanaque Mountains Overlook, and is a total one way hike of 0.72 mile from your parked car at the Green Turtle Pond entrance to the overlook itself.  The outcrop looks eastward and has a very pretty view of the Wanaque Mountains and the southern portion of the Ramapo Mountains.  The spot is close by Greenwood Lake Airport, and occasionally a low flying airplane will fly overhead either taking off or landing.  Otherwise the rock outcrop overlook is a quiet location off the ATV trails, and is sporadically populated with cedars.   It is actually a nice place for a picnic.   From late May through August bring along bug netting for your hike through the woods since the deer flies can be numerous and make a walk very unpleasant.   Once at the outcrop you should not be bothered by biting flies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcrop is steep, and in places almost cliff-like so if you have young children with you make sure you take all precautions to keep them (and yourself) safe.  I tried to find a safe location to place the geocache, so if you do have to search around for the cache, do not search in any dangerous or very steep terrain.    Actually the overlook area is generally pretty safe if you use sensible caution.  Once you find the cache please hide it the way you found it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you like this place.  It is part of the State Park System that includes Green Turtle Pond, but rarely accessed by most people, so the outcrop and overlook is not something many people get to see and enjoy.  Unlike many overlooks with great views this one doesn't require a tremendous effort to reach.   I believe it is less than 200 ft climb from car to overlook.  Other ways to the cache (notably from Paul's Place) involve  maybe a 100 ft ascension.  To get to outcrops with a view comparable to this one usually involve a rugged, steep 500 ft or more climb.  So this is quite unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One small section of the ATV trail I guided you to use  is steep, but I hiked up this same hill only one month after I had knee surgery so it can't  be all that challenging. &lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small black camouflage lock box, but big enough to contain a number of trinkets and the log.  I placed a few small items in the box to get the cache started.  This is my first geocache and I am hoping you will enjoy the view.  </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This cache is hidden in a safely accessible location. DO NOT go looking in steep or unsafe places.   The GZ is pretty good so your GPS should guide you precisely to the spot.   But if you need a clue, look under a craggy looking weathered cedar stump.   </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a typical, small plastic lock box which is located in NJ State Park Land bordering Greenwood Lake.  The cache is located near a rock outcropping, Big Rock Cove,  that both overlooks and drops down to the lake.  The outcropping is a short walk from the geocache and is a very nice place for a picnic, bank fishing  or just sitting and taking in the beautiful view looking north and west up Greenwood Lake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to replace my original geocach, which was located at the outcropping,  because it had been stolen by Muggles.  I placed this new second cache a small distance from Big Rock Cove, where my original cache was located. I did this to avoid looters who might come back to see if I put another one back in the original spot. The GPX file/coordinates have been changed to the location of the second cache.  Anyway, start from Paul's Place (the popular hotdog/fastfood restaurant/cafe located on Greenwood Lake Turnpike) or the Fire station and enter the woods across Greenwood Lake Turnpike. There are several places one can enter the woods, one of these is described as follows. Starting from Paul's Place at N 41o 08.592' W 74o 20.746' crossing Greenwood Lake Turnpike to Olcott Rd (don't go down Olcott Rd it is a Private Rd. !) there is a bank of mailboxes to the right when you are facing north. At the mailboxes is an ATV trail entering the woods which winds around a bit but shortly turns generally north. Follow the ATV trails generally north and you'll be ok. Let your GPS lead you, the geocache is not a hard find. Just a little further north from the geocache is Big Rock Cove. I very much encourage you to go the very short extra distance to Big Rock. The view up Greenwood Lake is beautiful. The rock itself is not a bad place to sit with a backpack picnic, but be careful of broken glass (courtesy drinking teens and fishermen). The location of Big Rock is: N 41o 08.854’ W 74o 20.479’ Historically Greenwood Lake was called Long Pond, hence the name of the geocache. I placed in a new load of trinkets in the second geocache. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Certainly TRL's most ambitious cache placement to date, for the
Stokes State Forest Petroglyph Trail Challenge involves a
substantial hike and climb as you progress from the initial stage
to the final cache location. For the most part, you can follow the
excellent trail system for the entire hike. Grab a trail map on
your way into the Park and then aim for the parking near Stony
Lake. The Swenson and Tinsley Trails are your friends and while you
are on them the terrain rating is the three noted above. The last
0.6 miles pops the rating a bit to 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, your challenge begins looking for
petroglyphs - pictures carved onto small to medium sized rocks.
These will be hidden as you might expect a cache to be hidden to
reduce the chance they will be muggled. Except for Stage 4 which is
grey, all the rocks are red-brown in color (stage 1 - pictured). On
the back side of the rock, will be the coordinates to the next
location. Please place it back exactly as you found it. NOTE: If it
is wet or snow is on the ground, this becomes a 5/4 as moisture
makes the petroglyphs all but disappear and some of the final 0.6
mile hike potentially treacherous. In 2008, TRL backed up every
location so that there are two elements with coordinates for you to
look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is a large ammo can. It contained a few TRL
Bearbait coins at launch and there was a special prize for the FTF.
Once you have found the cache, we would recommend that you continue
to N41 13.125; W074 43.102 which is one of the most spectacular
views in New Jersey. It requires about another 200' climb and 0.3
mile hike but it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please plan for your hike. Know the weather conditions before
you embark, leave sufficient times to rest, grab a snack, sightsee
and return before daylight fades. Know that in Stokes State Forest
hunting is permitted so when in season wear orange. Also be aware
that there are bears and other wildlife to watch for - know how to
respond in case you have an encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#1930Wow,  it turned into a long day.  Kevin, I really enjoyed the cache and all the work you put into it. I spent a good deal of time at each stage looking for and finding various quantities of original petroglyphs, new wood carving glyps and several of the alternative information holders.  I will be returning to stage 5 to place a new glyph.The trail was easy and the 800 foot gain was accomplished over 3.5 miles so it was largely unnoticed.  After spending so much time alone on the trails, I was sorta overwhelmed with people at the overlook.  I was expecting a little more privacy.The views were amazing and amounted to 300 degree viewsI really appreciated the unique effort for this cache.  I feel very happy to have completed it.  I was thrilled to have found some of your original artwork.  I am honored for you to allow me to adopt this cache.  </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Because of the historical nature of this cache and because more people are watching this cache then have found it I have requested to adopt it.  I will be hiking the cache route on Saturday.  If TRL contacts me and tells me to pick everything up, I will.  Otherwise I plan on signing the log and adopting it afterwards.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Below are given 3 sets of coordinates, each representing an&lt;br /&gt;interesting area in Montgomery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;N 41 30.719 W 74 15.601 - A Runway At OC Airport&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;N 41 31.724 W 74 14.290 - Ward's Bridge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;N 41 31.369 W 74 12.894 - Valley Central HS Football Field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These points represent 3 of the 4 vertices of an EXACT&lt;br /&gt;parallelogram. The cache is located near the 4th vertex. You have&lt;br /&gt;to calculate the position of the missing vertex before you go out&lt;br /&gt;looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you calculate the Vertex points you may realize there is&lt;br /&gt;more than one. In fact there are three vertex points, each a&lt;br /&gt;possible cache location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you could travel to all three locations &amp; scour the&lt;br /&gt;areas, there is a much easier way. You need to compute the centroid&lt;br /&gt;of the triangle that all 3 Vertex points form. At that centroid&lt;br /&gt;point, there is a sign that will give you the information needed to&lt;br /&gt;find the correct vertex point as well as the projection info from&lt;br /&gt;that Vertex point to the final cache location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this brings back some geometry memories!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Info obtained from Centroid point for Projection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance= .abc km&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degrees= c.ad*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;a= Number of letters in 3rd word&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;b= Number of letters in 2nd word&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;c= Rule # that starts with letter &quot;P&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;d= Number of letters in month listed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sake of the cache, the Vertex Points are labeled 1-3 with&lt;br /&gt;the one located farthest West as 1, next one East is 2, the&lt;br /&gt;farthest East one is 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the sign at the Centroid point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache Vertex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rule # that begins with the letter &quot;N&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to visit the Vertex site to make the final projection&lt;br /&gt;needed..though it is close by!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;br /&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changed it for a fuzzy + - 100 ft due to the nature of this puzzle&lt;br /&gt;and how you found the vertex &amp; did the projection. I used the&lt;br /&gt;Great Circle method. Either way you will be in the vicinity!&amp;lt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Horseshoe area of John Boyd Thacher State Park.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Horseshoe is an awesome area of the park on the top of a
large spur of the escarpment. The ledge trail runs around the edge
of the escarpment offering fantastic views at many vantage
points.&lt;br /&gt;
 There is a wooden fence to protect visitors from falling so please
do not cross the fence for any reason! It's not only illegal, it's
extremely dangerous and needless yet folks do it every year and
often pay the price with their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
 This cache is located within 25ft of the trail on the inside of
the horseshoe.&lt;br /&gt;
 Please stay on the trail until you are very close. If you reach
the old remains of a picnic table and grill you have gone in too
far.....turn around and head back towards the trail.&lt;br /&gt;
 So enjoy the cache, amazing views and have fun and be safe!&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Cdparker1’s 200th cache&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2ooth was meant to have been done by the end of 2008.  Time conspired against me and this cache did not come to be until March of 2009.  That’s ok, though, as it does follow the path of my 100th cache in that I hid it with my parents.  If we had the time and containers, I could have hid #201-#205 but those will have to wait.  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sawyer Mountain hike is just over two miles roundtrip with a 630 ft ascent.  It is probably one of the easier/easiest hikes in the Adirondacks with a nice view from the top.  Although the top is wooded, there are two ledges that offer a nice view.   The first is before the summit and the second is actually past the summit.  For the latter, just continue to follow the yellow markers.  You will know when you are there.  From this point you will have to bushwhack to the final.  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to locate the final you will need to project a waypoint from the waypoint given to you at the initial point. So, once you locate the set of coordinates, project a waypoint 171.4° for a distance of 855'. This will take you to the final destination.


&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: You, and all members of your party must read and agree to the www.geocaching.com disclaimer. In addition, you all must agree to hold the cache owner, www.opencaching.com and the landowners harmless from any and all causes for action. You and all other members of your party must individually and collectively determine your/their physical fitness and outdoors/hiking skill levels, decide whether or not to visit the various cache locations, and whether or not it is safe and prudent to do so under the conditions that will be encountered. Cache seekers assume all risks involved in seeking these cache locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People that do not wish to do a cache because of any danger they might perceive to be present is certainly within their right to not proceed. However you do not have the right to try to ruin the enjoyment of others in attempting a find that is beyond your capabilities, but not beyond theirs. This goes for almost every caching event there is. After all one might run into spiders, snakes, poisonous plants, trips and falls and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety First! .......Take a friend, Look out for others, take a cell phone if possible, watch where you're stepping, NEVER UNCOVER ANY CACHE WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET, USE A STICK! If you feel uncomfortable in doing a cache, for any reason, just walk away!!!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Beautiful Adirondack Beach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the cache is to introduce you to Terrill Pond and the great beach at the north end of the pond. It is one of, if not the nicest beach in the Adirondack Park's 6,000,000 acres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is about a quart cylinder placed to be winter friendly. See the gallery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beach is about a 1/4 mile long and sandy. The depth increases very gradually so you can wade out a long way before you get chest high. It is a great place to swim or just enjoy the sun. There is a Lean To near by and several nice campsites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northville Lake Placid trail from Long Lake or Lake Durant had some boot sucking mud today and the Lean To Log suggested the trails south was covered with water in places. The trail from the Blue Mountain Trail head should be better footing but has more elevation change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you take the cache away from the hide to do your trading and logging, please leave something behind to mark the spot so you can be sure of getting it back it the same place. Thanks and have a nice hike.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Les vélos BMX ont de petits cadres sur roues de 20 pouces, un guidon soulevé, un frein avant et arrière, et un siège bas. C'est la géométrie du cadre, un empattement court, qui fait que les BMX sont si maniables. Les courses de BMX se déroulent sur un parcours difficile avec des sauts et des courbes.Un petit prix pour le PAT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Il est possible que les coordonnées soient un peu offset, j’ai eu de la misère à les prendre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Bicycle motocross, or BMX, began in California in the 1970s and has evolved through a series of technological advancements. BMX bikes have small frames on 20-inch wheels, with raised handlebars, a front and rear brake, and low seats. It is the geometry of the frame, a short wheel base that make BMX bikes so maneuverable. BMX racing takes place on a challenging course with jumps and banks.

Rummaging through a pile of rocks to find a small container that is almost impossible to see.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;La
franco-québécoise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Cette 
cache se situe dans le village de La Minerve (Laurentides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Un cours d’eau important et
de nombreux lacs aux dimensions intéréssantes procurent
un attrait indéniable à la municipalité. La rivière Preston, située
à l’ouest, draine le territoire du
nord au sud
sur une
distance de 8 km. Elle prend en charge
les eaux de la chaine formée des
lacs Lesage, Napoléon, Croche et Équerre pour
ensuite affluer dans le lac
Minerve et le lac aux
Castors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Une 
autre chaîne de lacs
draine la partie centrale du
territoire sur plus de 15 kilomètres. 
Elle est
formée des lacs Désert,
Chapleau et des Mauves. À l'est, les plus importants plans d'eau
sont les lacs Labelle et
Alphonse. De plus, on compte
une trentaine de plus petits plans d'eau
présentant un certain intérêt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

En plus de la &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9serve_faunique_de_Papineau-Labelle&quot;&gt;réserve faunique de
Papineau-Labelle&lt;/a&gt; qui couvre le sud du
territoire, La Minerve possède
aussi la &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/For%C3%AAt_ancienne_du_Lac-Preston&quot;&gt;forêt ancienne du
Lac-Preston&lt;/a&gt; qui protège
une forêt
non-perturbée depuis plus de 400 ans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

La cache porte ce nom pour célébrer
les bons moments d’amitié franco-québécoise passés à La Minerve !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Elle se situe également proche du
point de départ de plusieurs chemins de
randonnée pédestre (de 2.5 à 16 km), encadrés par Le Club Plein Air de La Minerve. Il faut
s’adresser au Marché Bruneau &amp; frères pour demander un droit d’accès.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Bon geocaching et bonne rando à
tous 
J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

Je crois que le terrain est un peu surévalué à 4* mais tant qu'elle n'est pas sur la Black List d'Opus Terra, elle compte pour le Fizzy Challenge !
