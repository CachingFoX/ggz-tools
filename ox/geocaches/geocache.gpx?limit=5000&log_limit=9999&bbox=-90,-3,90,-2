&lt;br /&gt;
Cette cache pour vous faire découvrir un moulin aux étonnants mécanismes&lt;br /&gt;
dont la construction remonte à 1542.&lt;br /&gt;
Situé en alignement avec le moulin St-Michel, son emplacement offre un&lt;br /&gt;
panorama exceptionnel sur la Baie de St Brieuc.&lt;br /&gt;
Ce moulin était précieux aux navigateurs de retour de Terre Neuve car il servait (et me sert toujours) d'amer pour faire le point.&lt;br /&gt;
En ruine, il était envahi par les broussailles,&lt;br /&gt;
après une première phase de rénovation achevé en 2006,&lt;br /&gt;
il a été inauguré le 19 mai 2012,&lt;br /&gt;
pour la journée européenne des moulins à vent et du patrimoine meunier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Avec un peu de chance vous pourrez voir tourner ses ailes, sinon pour les moins chanceux&lt;br /&gt;
le voici en &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plourhan.fr/index.php/actualites/plourhan-evenements/429-moulin-de-merlet&quot;&gt;vidéo&lt;/a&gt; et en &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/43703024@N03/tags/inaugurationmerlet/show/&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vous cherchez une boite 8mm à pellicule photo.&lt;br /&gt;
Merci de prendre soin de la repositionner comme à l'identique.&lt;br /&gt;
Contient logbok et crayon&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

beautiful for the many Caches on Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;
A small cache.&lt;br /&gt;
 I hope it will for a
long time exist.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for the great caches
on Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Particular
thanks go to The Jersey Royals who have agreed to maintain this
cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With best regards from Germany.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

Parking in the National Trust car park, (N 50’ 44.019 W002’ 50.057) there is a small car parking fee for anyone not showing a members badge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is in the old medieval village of Stanton Saint Gabriel’s, a village that is no longer there. You can however, still have a seat in the remainders of the old chapel and take a look at the old farmhouse that has been renovated into National Trust Holiday Cottages.Interesting fact: When they renovated the cottage, they couldnt work out why the outside was bigger than the inside...turns out, there was a secret gap in the wall to allow local smugglers to hide their stash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Geocache can be combined with the caches below to make a circular route around the estate which should take you under 3 hours. The cache is a small drinks container which contains a log book, pencil and small tradables. Please ensure the lid is on properly before replacing.&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Golden Cap (0X2RVDY)&lt;br/&gt;Forever, for Everyone (0X2RHFX)&lt;br/&gt;Who’s that walking over my bridge?

OUT : pince bip-bip + autocollants animaux

N.B. : cette cache mériterait un TB mais la boîte a été oubliée dans la voiture (presque trois kilomètres plus bas).

In its heyday, Saint Gabriel’s was a bustling little village with the road going straight through the middle of it, straight past the chapel.

It’s a steady walk all the way round which allows you to take up some of the breath taking views and gather some of that brilliant fresh air that we have around the Dorset Coast. Parking in the National Trust car park, (N 50’ 44.019 W002’ 50.057) there is a small car parking fee for anyone not showing a members badge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust looks after and maintains the Golden Cap Estate. The estate is covered, with small fields of mainly permanent pasture and herb-rich meadows linked by ancient hedgerows. These hedgerows are maintained every year with the help of volunteers. Hedgerows are brilliant habitats for a variety of different species ranging from small birds to the illusive Dormouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Geocache can be combined with the caches below to make a circular route around the estate which should take you under 3 hours. The Cache is a camera film container which contains the log book only, please bring a pen with you.&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Golden Cap (0X2RVDY)&lt;br/&gt;Forever, for Everyone (0X2RHFX)&lt;br/&gt;Who’s that walking over my bridge?

The letters form an anagram of a special place on the estate and by substituting the numbers for letters you will have a 10 digit number.The first five digits will complete the Northings, and the last 5 will complete the westings. This is a large clip lid container so contains the usual log book and goodies. Tree cover can make GPS location dicey. Follow the natural route off the main path by the Oak to find the cache.Note: This an area full of Muggles so be careful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope that you have enjoyed your walk on the Estate and Happy Caching  </groundspeak:long_description>

Came back on the 12.8.11 and found it. Really don't know how we missed it first time around! 




Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!! We collected the clues as we went around and solved the anagram. We ended up with 2 hyphens, one of which made sense! Mr B retraced to one cache to check the clues. As the hyphen was #8 it was crucial. We guessed at the number and tried all 10 digits from 0-9. One of them made sense but we couldn't find it :-(. As there have been no other logs, we don't know if it has been found. The first log date in the caches were before publication which states 2.6.11!</groundspeak:text>

Decided to do this as a cache and dash as the rain was almost continuous this afternoon.

I note that this cache is listed as a multi but is a traditional which means the cache is at the listed coordinates.

Thank you for your hospitality and we look forward to finding the rest of your caches.</groundspeak:text>

The cache was a nice easy find but the coordinates took us to the hedge 50ft feet short of the cache site.  We took a reading of N 50° 48.233  W002° 04.564.  It was great to find another good sized box.  We took nothing and left a glowstick.

Thanks for another great cache.  Looking forward to the next!

This is what geocaching used to be like in the old days when it was all about taking you on a lovely walk with a nice big box at the end.  We loved the way the clues were in plain sight to start with and got progressively harder to find, and the nicely presented 4.6 litre box was a real treat.  We took nothing and left a glowstick.

Thanks for a great multi and for reminding us what it was like when we started caching ten years ago!

The clues were great fun to find, and we loved the way the first was hidden in plain sight, probably easier to spot at this time of year than in the summer!  The cache (a lovely big 4.6 litre box) had been found by accident by children on 8 October but everything seemed as it should be.  We took the NT voucher (thank you very much!) and left a couple of glowsticks.

Thanks for a great multi, just the sort we like.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was walking down Sandy Lane heading towards Rexes Hollow Lane this evening looking for a series of caches called &quot;Follies and the Ivy&quot; and just happened to notice this cache.  It had been found once before a few days ago.  I collected Sammy the working man's sheep and left octopussy.  Signed the lovely new logbook.  A lovely cache site. TFTC
25 Sep 2011
On my evening walk and checked on Jack's Stash.  Unfortunately the cache box has been broken so is in need of repair/replacement.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Westbury Ninja’s have been exiled from their Home in Japan, and have set up in Westbury, Wiltshire.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Father, Ta Ninja is married to Zun Ninja, they have 5 sons and 1 daughter, named, Yama, Ki, Shima, Masato, Mitsuo, and Maki. As you can see Mr and Mrs Ninja are not very imaginative when it comes to their children’s names.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
They have been tracked down to Westbury by the Evil Dragon Emperor, who has kidnapped Maki and hidden her in his Secret Evil Mine, which will require all of your cunning and caching skills in order to set her free from the  Secret Evil Mine, well temporally whilst you sign the log at least.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the ring, please forgive me if the GZ seems a little out my 15 year old Garmin Etrex is accurate to about ±5 meters at the best of times, so if you have updated Co-ordinates please let me know, and I will amend.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There are hints but you will need to read the description carefully in order to find them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MasatoNinja.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This Ninja has harnessed the power of Animals; but has been most successful in harnessing the power of Ducks over all other animals. But watch out for his arch nemesis the Bus carrying Muggles to destinations unknown to him.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Westbury Ninja’s have been exiled from their Home in Japan, and have set up in Westbury, Wiltshire.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Father, Ta Ninja is married to Zun Ninja, they have 5 sons and 1 daughter, named, Yama, Ki, Shima, Masato, Mitsuo, and Maki. As you can see Mr and Mrs Ninja are not very imaginative when it comes to their children’s names.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
They have been tracked down to Westbury by the Evil Dragon Emperor, who has kidnapped Maki and hidden her in his Secret Evil Mine, which will require all of your cunning and caching skills in order to set her free from the  Secret Evil Mine, well temporally whilst you sign the log at least.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the ring, please forgive me if the GZ seems a little out my 15 year old Garmin Etrex is accurate to about ±5 meters at the best of times, so if you have updated Co-ordinates please let me know, and I will amend.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There are hints but you will need to read the description carefully in order to find them.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Originally published and still available on Geocaching.com - http://coord.info/GCWW9K &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short walk uphill from the &lt;b&gt;Colliers Way&lt;/b&gt; cycleway through a very overgrown&lt;br /&gt;path, the cache is unfortunately not suitable for bicycles, buggies&lt;br /&gt;or wheelchairs (Handicache rating = H34342 - see http://www.handicaching.com) - cyclists please make sure that you take a lock to secure&lt;br /&gt;your bike. The railway line which also runs the length of the&lt;br /&gt;cylepath is useful for securing your bike – if you have not been&lt;br /&gt;here before don’t’ worry, it’s disused! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the cache is hidden in an avenue of woodland satellite&lt;br /&gt;reception isn't great.&lt;br /&gt;However, as the woodland is very narrow you can use the public&lt;br /&gt;footpath at the edge of the field to the left when going uphill and&lt;br /&gt;try a combination of dead reckoning and your cache hunting skills&lt;br /&gt;to locate it – there would be no fun without a challenge would&lt;br /&gt;there?! Please be aware that there are nettles in this area so you&lt;br /&gt;might want to wear long trousers or take a stick to get to/from&lt;br /&gt;this path – there are no nettles or similar nasties at the cache&lt;br /&gt;site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache container and contents were originally placed here by&lt;br /&gt;Unruely who decided not to activate it thinking the location was&lt;br /&gt;not very good. Having returned to the States this generous cacher&lt;br /&gt;offered it to me when I helped clear one of his other caches. On&lt;br /&gt;retrieving the cache I was impressed by its challenge, proximity to&lt;br /&gt;the Colliers Way and the views from the footpath beside the cache&lt;br /&gt;so have decided to leave it there – if you think it’s good credit&lt;br /&gt;Unruely, if you don’t like it blame me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst the cache is to the East of the Colliers Way you need to&lt;br /&gt;leave the cycleway to the West and go through the access tunnel&lt;br /&gt;under the line to access it - see additional waypoints below. Leave&lt;br /&gt;the cycletrack at the steps beside the small sewage works (hold&lt;br /&gt;your nose!) or via the Kilmesdon cycle/wheelchair access ramp which&lt;br /&gt;is about 100 yards further Southwest. If you are caching and&lt;br /&gt;dashing there is parking for one car by this tunnel but you are&lt;br /&gt;advised to park in the village car park and walk here. Go through&lt;br /&gt;the tunnel and the cache is up the hill near this track. However,&lt;br /&gt;as suggested above, once through the tunnel you may find it best to&lt;br /&gt;follow the public footpath at the edge of the field to your left&lt;br /&gt;until you are near the cache – happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the &lt;b&gt;Colliers Way&lt;/b&gt; and a map see this website - http://www.colliersway.co.uk/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Access tunnel - N 51° 16.366 W 002° 26.133&lt;br /&gt;Kilmersdon Village Car Park- N 51° 16.201 W 002° 26.271&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Very muddy and the path within the wood resembles a stream at the moment

The only daughter of Mr and Mrs Ninja, she has been kidnapped by the evil Dragon Emperor, (Didn’t I mention that earlier), cast down in his Secret Evil Mine she needs to be rescued (even temporarily). An excellent swimmer she is often most at home in water, more specifically no more than 1 Litre; well she is a little Ninja after all, and does easily get out of her depth.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Westbury Ninja’s have been exiled from their Home in Japan, and have set up in Westbury, Wiltshire.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Father, Ta Ninja is married to Zun Ninja, they have 5 sons and 1 daughter, named, Yama, Ki, Shima, Masato, Mitsuo, and Maki. As you can see Mr and Mrs Ninja are very imaginative when it comes to their children’s names.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
They have been tracked down to Westbury by the Evil Dragon Emperor, who has kidnapped Maki and hidden her in his Secret Evil Mine, which will require all of your cunning and caching skills in order to set her free from the  Secret Evil Mine, well temporally whilst you sign the log at least.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the ring, please forgive me if the GZ seems a little out my 15 year old Garmin Etrex is accurate to about ±5 meters at the best of times, so if you have updated Co-ordinates please let me know, and I will amend.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There are hints but you will need to read the description carefully in order to find them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ki Ninja.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This Little ninja is at one with the woods, and is often found not far from some form or another, and he especially likes old wooden gate posts, as his favourite hiding place as he feels most at home there.</groundspeak:long_description>

As well as being accessible on foot and by bicycle this cache has been designed to be wheelchair friendly, but be warned - the immediate path can get quite muddy in winter. There are great views of the Mendip Hills and Cheddar Gorge from around this site and there is a good circular walk around the Cheddar Reservoir just a few yards away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Strawberry Line is part of the National Cycle Network.Download a pdf route leaflet (1114KB) here - http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/leaflets/Strawberry%20Line%20leaflet.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GPSr is not essential to find this cache so that those new to this game who do not yet own one can use the map on the top right of this page (change the view to Bird's eye and zoom in), Google Earth (http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/earth/download/ge/) or similar satellite imaging programme to see the area where the cache might be hidden then go out and search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheelchair/mobility scooter cachers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hide has been set with wheelchair users in mind. The access from Holwell Lane or from either end of the Strawberry Line is level with no steps but off the Strawberry Line it is a more bumpy and often muddy farm track. Those with limited mobility may need a grab stick to retreive the box. The Handicache rating (http://www.handicaching.com/) for this cache is &lt;strong&gt;H22112 -&lt;/strong&gt; Click the log below to see details. Incidentally, the Strawberry Line has excellent mobility access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking - N 51° 16.667 W 002° 47.691&lt;br /&gt;Parking for wheelchair users only - N 51° 16.663 W 002° 47.332&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Not many caches out there yet! This doesn't surprise me as I struggle to see the point of two separate geocaching sites, however this one gave me an excuse for a nice walk around the reservoir. An easy find as the cache was quite exposed, so I hid it a bit better afterwards. Thanks for this one Robin.</groundspeak:text>

_________

FTF  .. with Paradiddle.

When I received the cache notification about this cache, I smiled.  Was FollowMeChaps thinking of me when he set it .... or was he trying to make me even more frustrated than I already was!   An accessible cache so close to home .... but that I knew was totally out of reach for me because at that time I was restricted to hopping on one foot with the aid of crutches (and to the kitchen and back was far enough!)

So, today was the day that I finally managed a level walk along the Strawberry Line ... and after 3 months we find an empty log book.  (now that wouldn't happen on GC.com).  We continued back past the sailing club where there was lots of activity this afternoon.

TFTC, TNLN.

PS - Weekends and Wednesday evenings are a good time if you want to see the sailing boats/wind surfers in action.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;If any body would like to expand to this series please do, I
would just ask that you could let Sadexploration know first so he
can keep track of the Church numbers and names to avoid
duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

Colliery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greyfield Colliery started life in 1833 and closed some 78 years
later in 1911. Closure was due to the Earl Of Warwick refusing to
pay heavy royalties on coal mined under neighbouring estates, and
put 300 men out of work. The pit flooded in 1909 killing only
horses kept underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footpath runs between Clutton hill and Maynard Terrace. The
path can be overgrown during the summer, but dies back in the
winter for easier access. It maybe easier to access from Maynard
Terrace end of the footpath during summer. The public footpath is a
right of way between two gardens in Maynard Terrace and up
decorative gravelled steps. The path is sign posted, but the photos
below make finding the start of the path a little easier and more
discrete.&lt;/p&gt;

Mineral Railway to Frome, forming a 24 mile through route. The line

Steeplejacking has been in that familly for six generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building a short walk backtowards Clutton was once an Inn
called the Cross Keys and described as a&quot;Snug Old Fashioned Inn and
Small Holding with Beer and Tobacco Licence&quot; when sold by the Earl
of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that is the former Burchills Colliery, belonging to the
Earl of Warwick's estate. The mine operated an incline and worked
coal between 1911 and 1921. Equipment had been transferred from
Greyfield Colliery upon its closure in 1911. The site is now a
housing estate with the mine entrance approximately under the
children play park.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, it also became the place where we cached. We had intended to revisit the brilliant 'Below Above' series, but 5 out of the 8 in our party pulled out and 3 is insufficient for safety....So Heffalump007, ToffeeApple and Sandvika had a day of alternative caching instead. 

We were lured to this series due to many also being Garmincaches. Many of our top caching experiences have been Terracaches, Navicaches and more recently OpenCaches (not to be confused with Garmin hijacking the same name).

Enjoying the history of Clutton, a quick easy find by Heffalump007! TFTC Sandvika #1569</groundspeak:text>

of the Birdie's Peach Jar Cache Competition although this one
started as a jar of prunes. (Hence the delay in getting it into the
field!) Sorry this is now premium membership due to a cache
thief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may guess this isn't a
contender for the least found category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find Mega assistance

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This geocache, which is also listed on Opencaching.org.UK (http://www.opencaching.org.uk/) is near one of the viewpoints on the northern flank of Cadbury Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hill is open access and therefore open to the public. Although not high (81 mtr at the summit) Cadbury Hill commands great views over the surrounding northerly fringe of the Somerset levels. On a clear day you can see to the mountains of Wales, the Aberthaw power station chimney (26 miles), and Exmoor (45 miles) as well as more locally across the village of Yatton and the surrounding levels to Clevedon and Weston. About 200 mts to the south west the main part of the hill hosts a hillfort with signs of occupancy going back to the Neolitic - this is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument (http://ycccart.co.uk/CadburyHill.aspx/) and certainly worth a visit whilst you are here. Please note that this cache is hidden outside the scheduled monument area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended route is to park at the recommended Parking (see below) and approach from the North West. You might like to follow the waypoints for the nearby Cadbury Hill multi geocache (see below) which starts at the same place then you can pick up this one, plus the other 2 caches on Cadbury Hill (see below), on your way round - 4 for the price of one! Keep your eye out for the recently restored dewpond (see additional waypoints) and the lost mineshaft – don't worry, it has a concrete cap!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Geocaches on this hill:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cadbury Hill (multi) - http://coord.info/GCWA76&lt;br /&gt;Golden Desert Eagle - http://coord.info/GC2FGTZ&lt;br /&gt;Flaming Kestrels - http://coord.info/GC2FGV4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt; that whilst you can approach this cache from the South East via Blind Lane there is no public parking on this lane and you are asked not to drive or park in this lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheelchair/mobility scooter&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cachers&lt;/strong&gt; can access this cache by either of 2 options:&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy route - ignore the final paragraph above and park carefully at N51° 22.922 W002° 48.023 keeping tight to the wall ensuring that you do not obstruct the kissing gate, house access or public bridleway.&lt;br /&gt;2) Intrepid route - only suitable for the more adventurous  'all terrain' wheelchair geocacher. Park at the normal Parking coordinates and follow the route. This involves involves a relatively steep 300 mtr hill climb on grass/track and you'll need to skirt around the anti-motorcycle boulders at the bottom - just continue a few meters South East along the bridleway and pick up a second side path. Certainly a challenge but there are no steps or other impassable barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handicache rating (http://www.handicaching.com) based on option 1) is = &lt;strong&gt;H14122&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB: Unfortunately the 3 nearby caches are not wheelchair/scooter accessible as kissing gates bar the way &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Waypoints:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking - N 51° 23.017 W0 02° 48.383&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dewpond - N 51° 22.933 W 002° 48.272&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The Bristol and North Somerset Railway was a railway line in the
West of England that connected Bristol with towns in the Somerset
coalfield. The line ran almost due south from Bristol and was 16
miles long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal traffic on the railway was coal from the Somerset
coalfield, though the villages nearer Bristol generated some
commuter traffic. Passenger services were never frequent: in 1910,
there were eight trains a day at most (on Thursdays and Saturdays)
and not all of those ran through to or from Frome.&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is accessible from a tarmac surface with a gentle incline. The cache is NOT on Church grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1087 at the time of the Domesday Book, &quot;Brisilton&quot; was part of the Manor of Cainesham (Keynsham) and, in the same year, became a manor in its own right. The settlement grew from a collection of wattle and daub huts around Brislington Brook in the area still referred to today by locals as &quot;The Village&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is placed close to the Parish Church of St.Luke the Evangelist. It was built in 15th century. A famous tomb in the churchyard dated 1542, is inscribed “Thomas NEWMAN aged 153”. I think a local prankster carved an extra digit! Another famously long-lived person arrived in 1556, the vicar, Richard PHILPOT. He made the first entry in the parish register on 2nd September 1566, the baptism of John, son of John MACY. The registers have been kept continuously ever since apart from a hiatus during the interregnum. PHILPOT was relieved by Oliver CHIVERS in 1631, when by my reckoning he would have been 97.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brislington's origins of course go back much further. The first documented evidence comes from the remains of the Romano British villa, dating from 270 - 300 CE, which were discovered when Winchester Road was being built in 1899. Prehistoric flint tools dating from the Neolithic age have also been discovered in several locations, showing that Brislington was inhabited more than 4,000 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearby, on the junction of Glenarm Road and the A4 Bath Road (top of Brislington Hill) the once home of Nora Fry can be found.&lt;br/&gt;Norah Fry (1871-1960) was born and educated in Bristol. She was a member of a famous Bristol Quaker family who made chocolate and cocoa at the famous JS Fry and Sons chocolate factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norah Fry was an advocate for better services for people with learning disabilities. She was very concerned about the lack of proper schools for disabled children and the shortage of housing for people with learning disabilities. For over fifty years she was a member of the council of Bristol University and had a very close relationship with university staff. Norah Fry gave the university some money to set up the Department of Mental Health. The Nora Fry Research Centre continues this work as part of the University today.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is part of an established series of geocaches at National Trust Tyntesfield. They are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located on public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information on the biodiversity of each location and a family-friendly activity to do. All geocaches are less than 5m from the public or permissive footpaths. Some may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with the geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Please note that the Activity Cards and Information Cards belong to this Geocache and should not be removed. There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys, usb cables) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs). As the geocaches are quite large (lunch box size) they are suitable for larger travel bugs*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. The public and permissive footpaths on the estate can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather. Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2. As with any woodland area, there are lots of roots and other trip hazards about – so watch where you put your feet. As with any woodland, it is not advisable to walk here in high winds due to the risk of falling branches.&lt;br/&gt;3. Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths. There are also some sections of barbed wire along the fence line.&lt;br/&gt;4. Please keep an eye out for stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the woodland plants (e.g. bluebells in spring).&lt;br/&gt;5. Some of the footpaths pass through fields, which at some times of year have livestock in them (sheep / young cows). Please close all gates behind you!&lt;br/&gt;6. Parking is only available within the Tyntesfield estate when we are open to the public - everyday apart from Christmas Day. Some local parking is available (e.g. New Battleaxes Pub, Wraxall or on Wraxall Hill) but may be limited, especially on weekends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information: The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate slopes and several stiles along the route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be sure to let us know what you think in the log-books.</groundspeak:long_description>

Some may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with the geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Please note that the Activity Cards, Information Cards, metallic crayons and scrap paper belong to this Geocache and should not be removed. There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys, usb cables) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs). As the geocaches are quite large (lunch box size) they are suitable for larger travel bugs*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. The public footpaths on the estate can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather. Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2. As with any woodland area, there are lots of roots and other trip hazards about – so watch where you put your feet.&lt;br/&gt;3. Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths. There are also some sections of barbed wire along the fence line.&lt;br/&gt;4. Please keep an eye out for stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the woodland plants (e.g. bluebells in spring).&lt;br/&gt;5. Some of the footpaths pass through fields, which at some times of year have livestock in them (sheep / young cows). Please close all gates behind you!&lt;br/&gt;6. Parking is only available within the Tyntesfield estate when we are open to the public - everyday except for Christmas Day. Some local parking is available (e.g. New Battleaxes Pub, Wraxall or on Wraxall Hill) but may be limited, especially on weekends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Information: The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate slopes and several stiles along the route.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The main target of our caching weekend and for reasons of lack of planning the last we did, rather than the first of the day.  Initially we struggled to find the animals and ended up heading back to where we started. I'd been running the cartridge on my Oregon but joined in with my Android and soon it had more or less caught up. I made a couple of diversions to collect animals I'd already found on my Oregon and they were level pegging. Perseverance paid off and soon we were finding more animals than the minimum we needed. As we had run out of daylight and it was pretty dark, we abandoned our search for the tricky purple route which kept on giving us the slip and settled for 16 animals. If we'd known we'd tied with the previous maximum, I think we'd have had one last push for the 17th.

I loved the narrative of the game though with the Oregon stalling I was saving the cartridge after each animal had been found. My Android didn't stall but instead ate its battery so I ended up disabling the GPSr and enabling it again to capture more animals when the Oregon found one. So the Oregon was satisfactory, but the Android would not have got me through it on its own.  I'm guessing it's down to the number of active zones, the issue that has made my wherigo more challenging than most, for the wrong reasons!

I'm thinking about making up an external battery pack using 4 AA batteries and a 5V voltage regulator because it would make the Android much more viable. It's obvious that it has more compute power than the Oregon, because it was more stable. Unlike &quot;Snakes&quot; where the GPSrs conflicted, requiring different routes to be taken and therefore only really allowing one of them to be used, this Wherigo posed no such problems.  Another favourite.

As a result we did two full circuits and picked up some more friends, will send our file. We also had a couple of blackouts from the Oregon and struggled to get the pointer to the viewpoint, possibly because we reached 10 friends on the far side of the woods.

Having said that we enjoyed it and as a demonstration of the potential power of Whereigo for self-guided interpretative trips, it was impressive. Thanks for all the work that went into this cache and an enjoyable afternoon.

We left a Signature Womble (Westing) and a keyring torch.</groundspeak:text>

Feeling very full, I was just able to make the 500 feet to this cache which was fortunately of a type that I've seen before so found immediately.

A wonderful experience and thanks for rounding it off with this cache. </groundspeak:text>

Park on the coast road behind Clevedon Golf Course (take care with children as cars drive quickly along this section of narrow road). A short walk down the road will lead to the footpath up into the woods on the left. Path is steep and can be slippery in the rain. This should be a good cache for the kiddies (Trinkets etc inside for the kids to swap). Afterwards, why not pop down the road to the village shop for some refreshment? (Unfortunately closed on Sundays) </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache &amp; Dash - Accessible by car or motorcycle, no stiles to climb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first ever cache placed by Xan173 and Princessbuttercp of Bristol. We chose this location as it is on a great motorcycling road where one of our friends had a minor accident, hence the reference to Cuffy's corner. The cache can be driven to and parking for one car should be available. Please watch out for motorcycles when arriving at or leaving this cache, especially at weekends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a classic tupperware box in a camo bag. The cache contents at start are: A US $1 bill, a French 5 centimes coin, a badge, an Aeroplane clip, a 1 US cent coin, a mountain bike tool / keychain, an &quot;I love Mum&quot; heart shaped tattoo sticking plaster, a mini highlighter pen, an ink stamp, and true to our Bristolian roots a &quot;Vicky Pollard&quot; top trumps playing card.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">St Nicholas, Hardwicke&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Winebaud de Ballon in 1092 gave a church called Hardwicke, with its tithes and 6 yardlands, to Bermondsey Priory and the priory is said to have sold that church in the later 13th or the 14th century. About 1188 Hardwicke church was recorded as a chapel belonging to Standish church, but the record is of the establishment of a perpetual vicarage of Hardwicke, it clearly enjoyed in the late 12th century a degree of independence unusual for a chapel of ease.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The endowment of the vicarage included part of the great tithes, corn-rents from each yardland in the parish, the small tithes, and obventions, the great tithes passed to Gloucester Abbey presumably when the abbey appropriated Standish church. The separate parochial status of Hardwicke, exemplified by the right of burial there in 1493, was acknowledged in the 16th century.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From 1498 until the 20th century Hardwicke normally had a chaplain or curate, maintained and nominated by the Vicar of Standish. John Jennings, who was curate of Hardwicke in 1532, was in 1551 found to be poor in learning and in the same year he was reviled in the church while teaching the catechism. In 1563 Jennings was Vicar of Haresfield, but it was he whom the parishioners blamed for the failure to find a curate for Hardwicke. Later the same year the curate was Jarret Trye, presumably one of the Tryes of Park manor, and three later 16th-century curates were recorded. In 1650 the curate was a graduate, Thomas Holland, described as a constant preacher, and Hardwicke was thought fit to become a separate parish. In 1661 and 1662 there was apparently no curate, but curates for Hardwicke were recorded in 1676, 1716, and c. 1750. At the last of those dates the curate may have been maintained by Lord Hardwicke, who was said to be patron, but there was only one service each Sunday. In 1680 a glebe terrier for Hardwicke listed a house of 3 bays, much out of repair; unlike the land listed in the terrier, it was apparently unlet, and may have been for the curate's use.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In 1705 the house was in good repair but of only 2 bays. In 1807 it was described as a thatched cottage, containing a kitchen and pantry, with two rooms above. The house stands on the south side of the churchyard, a simple timber-framed building covered with roughcast, of one story with an attic. In 1967, when it was called the Old Vicarage, it retained its thatch. In the mid 19th century the curates lived at the cottage, which became a private house in the seventies when a new glebe house was built of red brick in Hardwicke village. Successive curates for Hardwicke lived at Standish in 1784, at Eastington in 1820, and at Gloucester in 1831; from 1856 to 1948 the curates lived at Hardwicke, as in 1967.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The church of St Nicholas, so called by the late 18th century, but called St. Mary's c. 1708, is built of ashlar with a Cotswold slate roof; it comprises chancel, north and south chapels, nave, north and south aisles, south-west tower, and south porch. The arcade of 3 bays that until the mid 19th century divided the nave and the south aisle was said to be Norman, but it is more likely to have been of the early 13th century. The walls of the chancel, nave, and south aisle may have been rebuilt at that period, from which survive the plain chancel arch and the south doorway flanked by attached shafts with enriched capitals. Some fragments of the same period, perhaps from the nave arcade, have been reset in the south chapel. There are two plain piscinas side by side, one broad and one narrow.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The embattled west tower, of three stages with an internal stair-vice and gargoyles at the parapet, and the porch, which was originally on the north side, were built in the early 14th century. The consecration of the great altar by the Bishop of Worcester in 1315 may have marked the completion of a phase of new building.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Additions apparently of the late 14th century were the rood-loft, and the three-light west window with a transom and early Perpendicular tracery. In 1348 the Vicar of Standish was made responsible for the chancel of Hardwicke church. The south chapel was apparently built in the 15th century, though the east window looks as though it may be of the 14th and is said to have been the original east window of the chancel. Also of the 15th century is the squint of two trefoil-headed lights on the south side of the chancel arch. William Trye (d. 1497) left money for reroofing and reflooring the nave. The south aisle was regarded as the property of the Tryes in the early 18th century, and the chapel at its east end as their mortuary chapel.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The church was restored in the 1840's, when the principal change seems to have been the replacement of the nave arcade and the rebuilding of the east end of the chancel to incorporate a 14th-century window, with head-stops to the labels inside and out, removed from Haresfield church. A more comprehensive restoration and enlargement, under Waller &amp; Son of Gloucester in 1878, included building the north aisle to seat the boys of the reformatory, with a chapel at its east end to house a new organ in place of one introduced in 1868, removing the galleries, and transferring the porch from the north to the south doorway. In 1927 the tower was restored; in 1938 the organ was moved from the north chapel to the west end of the north aisle, and given a new case.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The monuments in the church include a large number in the south chapel to members of the Trye family, the earliest having lost their inscriptions but thought to be to John Trye (fl. 1450) and William Trye (d. 1497). Six are altar-tombs, and that to John Trye (d. 1591) has a stone effigy under an arched canopy piercing the wall of the chancel. The 13th-century font has a pedestal of 8 engaged shafts and a circular arcaded bowl. There were 4 bells c. 1703, of which a medieval bell inscribed in Gothic capitals Sancta Maria or a pro nobis MWTA, one of 1639, and one by Abraham Rudhall of 1693 have survived. Two bells were added in 1819 (one was recast in 1841) and another in 1836. Six were rehung and dedicated in 1927, but they did not apparently include the medieval bell, which was on the floor of the nave in 1967. The plate includes a chalice and paten-cover inscribed 1572. The registers begin in 1566 and are virtually complete. The oak chest is dated 1676.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The lich-gate to the churchyard was opened in 1921, as a war memorial.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Updated cache container. Now holds pencil and small items.</groundspeak:long_description>

Yet you are in a tranquil area between woods and open meadow, next to the Wye.&lt;br/&gt;This cache is just off the Wye Valley Walk, and can be part of several circular walks - from Lydbrook, from Huntsham Bridge, or down the ridge of Coppett Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can only park about 3km away. Park nr. Huntsham bridge and walk along the river path, or at Goodrich and walk along the Coppett Hill ridge to the southern end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was set up for the Coppett Hill Geocaching festival - 30th June 2012. The land is owned by the Coppett Hill Trust, on whose behalf the festival is organised. </groundspeak:long_description>

Walked over the top of the hill to reach this one. What a great location - several times I've stood on top of Yat Rock looking down, but this was my first visit to this side of the river.

Cache was a quick find, then it was back round the west side of the peninsula to Goodrich Castle.

For the best caches I find I award a TOP CACHE geocoin (see http://www.amberel.com/topcache.htm ). Mostly for the location, this was a TOP CACHE :-) .

Thanks for the cache,

The stile brings you on to the Wye valley walk near Mainoaks. From here you can walk down below Symonds Yat rock and see the peregrines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a delightful uneven path though a mixed woodland - my dog loves it. The nearest official parking is in Goodrich or Coppett Hill Triangle, but you may be able to park nr. Huntsham bridge and walk by the river.&lt;br/&gt;Occasionally climbers us the rock outcrops above. Look for the white painted animal on one of the rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was set up for the Coppett Hill Geocaching festival - june 30th 2012 - and is on Coppett Hill Trust land </groundspeak:long_description>

Searched for some time at the indicated position, but with no success - couldn't even see anything that resembled the hint. Having read the Groundspeak logs it was apparent that the listed co-ordinates were abysmally poor. I wandered back down the road and saw nothing, then the other way, round the corner, and eventually found the cache with my GPSr reading 190 feet away !!!!!!

The problem with the poor co-ordinates is particularly serious in the light of the cache being hidden in someone's garden - we are told it has permission to be there, but with such poor co-ordinates the searcher has no idea if he is looking in the wrong garden !!!

That this problem has been reported so often on Groundspeak suggests it is not a problem with my reading but with the cache owner's. This urgently needs to be sorted out. In case it helps, my reading is N51 51.833 W002 36.682

The cache contains a squirrel toy that nearly fills it. Unfortunately it is a hairy squirrel and the hair is hard to contain within the box, with the result that water wicks in - the cache is slightly damp inside.

Thanks for the cache,

The path is well trodden and busy at times. You'll see lots of day-canoeists [and groups of them] with young people excitedly discovering the beauty of the river [and the Symonds Yat rock further down the river].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular cache is at the site of the bridge which took the railway from Kerne  Bridge to Lydrook and Symonds yat. The railway was closed in the late 50's - oh what a beautiful trip that must have been. The cache is a simple tupperware box near the Stockingboat cottage. Mrs Stockingboat was the lady who used to operate the ferry here. Up behind the cottage N51 51 44.5  W 002 36 04.1 is the cutting towards the tunnel cutting under Coppett Hill - take a torch and wellies if you want to go through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park in Goodrich, or at Kerne Bridge and follow river - south side&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was set up for/by the Coppett Hill Geocaching festival - June 30th. 2012. The cache is permitted by the Coppett Hill Trust landowner, and the cottage owner. </groundspeak:long_description>

My goodness, that was a steep start :-) . A muddy ascent, which I had to complete without my walking pole, having accidentally left it near a TerraCache in the Cotswolds yesterday.My GPSr led me to an area with no obvious hiding place, and after some casting around I resorted to the hint. I was so far from where eventually I found the cache that I couldn't even see the hint object! The steep slope and heavy tree cover do make it very hard for a GPSr.Some more somewhat aimless wandering about did reveal something that fitted the hint, and the cache was then soon found. An good, old fashioned location for a cache, and that is intended as a high compliment.Thanks for the cache,Rgds, Andy</groundspeak:text>

Really didn't know what to make of this one. My GPSr was pointing me right into the garden, but the cache page wasn't clear about whether it was inside or out. After failing to find it from the outside I was faced with the possibility of searching inside the garden without knowing if I was supposed to be there or not.

So I first spoke to the owner of the property to ask permission to look inside. And that left me more confused than ever. The owner of the B&amp;B explained that the cache was placed for the duration of an event last week, and was (permanently) no longer present.

Naturally, after that there was no way I could search his garden, so I departed, but the status of the cache does urgently need to be sorted out please.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is set in the walled garden of The Greyfriars a lovely 15th century Merchant’s house situated in the heart of the City of Worcester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greyfriars is a house with a twist. It was saved from demolition in the 1940’s and if you visit the house you will see how the ‘Make Do and Mend’ ethos of that era created this unique house and garden. Discover a bit more about Worcester and how The Greyfriars was part of the city’s history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE NOTE THIS CACHE IS ONLY AVAILABLE WHEN THE HOUSE IS OPEN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greyfriars is open in 2012 from 14 February until 15 December from 1.00 pm until 5.00 pm from Tuesday to Saturday inclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you may wish to pay to visit the house, there is no admission charge to the garden if you are looking for the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a regular clip lock box in ‘camo’ finish. Stealth will be necessary during busy times. Feel free to use the Summer House or other secluded areas to sign the log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first Opencache for Bridgnorth!! Hopefully the first of many.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nice easy little nano cache in beautiful Bridgnorth. This cache is located on the Bridgnorth quayside and was chosen for it’s amazing views across the river and bridge. There are no access issues and the ground is level but this area can flood if the waters are very high. Please obey the warning signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridgnorth’s quayside had three dockyards as well as numerous warehouses, stables, and other commercial buildings. Many of the bargemen drank and lived in the houses along Cartway and Underhill Street.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safe passage between Bristol and Montgomeryshire (155 miles) depended on the water level. Upstream came spices, groceries, wine, and rum. Downstream went coal, dairy produce, pottery, wood, leather, and iron goods. The trade peaked in the mid 18th century; when there were 376 vessels operating between Welshpool and Gloucester, including 75 from Bridgnorth. River trade declined with the opening of the original Severn Valley Railway in 1862.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a bridge here as early as the 10th century. The later stone bridge once had several houses on it including a church, and a gatehouse that had a portcullis and also served as a gaol. Shortly before Thomas Telford widened the bridge in 1822-23 these buildings were removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is published on the Geocaching website also: GC30HKP.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take extra care as the road is quite busy and fast at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the best views of Bridgnorth. Standing at the cache site you over look the town, you can see the churches of St Leonard’s and St Mary’s also the cliff railway.

Dusk was closing in but we managed to get here with enough daylight left to spot the cache easily and then a u-ey back up to the car. Had fun identifying the birds giving us a serenade on the way back.

It's great to know that it's still just light enough at 16:30 for 'daytime' caching and even better that the days are now getting longer .

Nipped out for a bit of fresh air and as we reckoned we could fit these 2 in just before dark we popped down and parked up in an old familiar spot on Port Lane.

Walked along an old familiar stretch of canal - not for the first time while caching - but glad to do so as it's a lovely stretch. Encountered a few muggles along the way.

GZ was quiet though and I nipped up for the quick find and to take the TB on it's way.

There is also the delicate decorative scheme in the Boudoir, which has recently been revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects are part of 'Attingham Re-discovered', which has been carefully bringing the house and grounds back to life since 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mansion is at the heart of this great estate between Shrewsbury and the River Severn and is set in beautiful parkland designed to impress.

I was in early this morning so I decided I would go and find this one while it was still quiet. A quick walk down into the woods and the cache was quickly found.

Luckily I had a pencil with me as there isn't one in the cache.

Looks like I need to change my plans for the [url=http://coord.info/GC2C175]To Cache a Kippa[/url] event as I was going to place a cache very close to here.

Arrived in my inbox just before 5pm and as it was Keele Woods, there really was no question, I was off!!   Was a little disappointed to find the cache in full view from the field.  I tried to camoflauge it a bit more with sticks, but its not easy.
Left a couple of England world cup medals and took the dragonfly tb.

It is a couple of metres off the footpath near to large boulders of slag spoil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apedale canal was built in 1776, after Sir Nigel Gresley (the then owner of the Apedale Estate) and his son Nigel Bowyer-Gresley obtained permission to build it through an Act of Parliament in 1775. Unlike many Canals this was privately owned.&lt;br/&gt;It ran from Sladderhilll colliery in Apedale, past the Iron works, across what is now the Holditch Industrial Estate, and then onto Newcastle. The Newcastle end of the canal terminated at Liverpool Road, North of Newcastle.&lt;br/&gt;The coming of rail spelt the end for the Apedale Canal which closed to traffic in the 1850. Very little remains other than a few traces in Apedale, notably an embankment which carried the canal across the stream at the bottom of Apedale Valley can still be seen.</groundspeak:long_description>

Probably due to tree cover GPS accuracy at time of waymarking plus/minus 23ft.&lt;br/&gt;The cache location is an easy woodland ramble.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is on a track a few meters off the footpath which borders the Chesterton community angling clubs Burley Pool which is Private property and need not be trespassed upon.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not a regular container and blends in well with it's location. Close inspection will be required!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ample parking is available at The Apedale visitor centre until dusk or off Apedale road.&lt;br/&gt;The most preferable approach to this cache would be from the visitor centre or Apedale road.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is situated along a track just off the footpath in the woodland and is not wheelchair accessible!&lt;br/&gt;Sensible footwear is recommended as the area can be muddy in wet weather!&lt;br/&gt;The area may be very busy in summer time so I suggest stealth is used as a priority!&lt;br/&gt;If you find the cache please leave it exactly as you found it as I wish it to remain at least 2 or 3 seasons until requiring maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;There is a small pencil with a waterproof paper logbook.&lt;br/&gt;In summer when the tree canopy thickens GPS accuracy may be quite poor, to this end if requested I shall add a specific photographic spoiler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would finders please not photograph the cache or it's location as I want the experience for others to be intact.

A day off work and glorious weather for a change [8D], so I thought I would go and get the four new caches that had just been published around Apedale. Just as you get them all done, someone puts more out. [;)]

This was the second of the day and took about five minutes to find. A good hide, luckily I have seen one of these before. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

It was great to see some familiar faces and at the same time be able to walk around and actually find all the caches for ourselves rather than in the hands of the previous finders! 
This was our second ever Opencaching.com cache. We enjoyed the stroll back down through the gardens and then being led to this lovely quiet spot. While the boys played with the small hoops, we set about searching for the cache. The cache title seemed to indicate where to look, but after exhausting all the obvious options we widened our search. Al then went chasing after a hoop that James had thrown and hey presto! there was the cache container. Just shows how sometimes you can't find something unless you're not looking for it. Thanks for the cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the sixth of the caches that we found while attending the Biddulph Grange event today with jamange. It was great to see some familiar faces and at the same time be able to walk around and actually find all the caches for ourselves rather than in the hands of the previous finders! 
This was our first ever Opencaching.com cache, as until now we've only seen listings that are duplicates of ones that had already been published on Geocaching.com so it was hard to see the point of them. Not a political or value judgement point, just a practical one.
But these ones are only listed here... so here we are now! We had a lovely stroll through the gardens, and made much harder work of finding this one than we should have done. Quite a few things matching the hint, and the GPSs weren't settling that well with the tree cover. But finally, after exhausting all the nearby options, we were just about to give up and move on when another cacher spotted it. Well done you! We all signed the log, and then wondered why we'd not spotted it sooner. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

It was great to see some familiar faces and at the same time be able to walk around and actually find all the caches for ourselves rather than in the hands of the previous finders!
It was also the fourth and last of the Opencaching.com caches that we did today, another new experience and a welcome one. The GPS walked us straight up to this one, and as we closed in with me counting down the distance it was jamange who nonchalantly spotted it in the first place that she tried. A nice easy find to end the day, then. We were running seriously late for the car park where we'd left her car, and my GPS went flat as we walked away from this one, so we had to resist going for the final new cache that we knew was nearby. How did we do that? I'm still not too sure. But a good excuse to come back to this beautiful location another day. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the eighth of the caches that we found while attending the Biddulph Grange event today with jamange. It was great to see some familiar faces and at the same time be able to walk around and actually find all the caches for ourselves rather than in the hands of the previous finders! 
This was our third Opencaching.com cache, and the last of those placed inside the gardens. We did this one while completing the stages for the new multicache listed on Geocaching.com and it certainly proved to be conveniently close by for one of them. The boys made an instant find as soon as we told them that we were now close to ground zero. Another lovely spot for a cache, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stroll back and forth around the beautiful gardens. Thanks for the cache.

Tree cover did not affect my co-ordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cache is close to Cheshire’s Sandstone Trail which is one of the finest and most popular long distance walks in North West England, in the UK. For many, it’s probably the best Cheshire walk and the ultimate Cheshire Way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sandstone Trail stretches for 34 miles/55 kilometres and offers superb, unbroken, and often elevated walking across the still largely green and pleasant English county of Cheshire — from the ancient market town of Frodsham on the broad Mersey estuary, in the north, to Georgian Whitchurch in rural north Shropshire, in the south.</groundspeak:long_description>

Along the route are some peaceful spots and wonderful views of the landscape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of several routes with end-points in the Frodsham area, others being the Delamere Way, the Sandstone Trail and the Longster Trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

coordinates.. Pott Shrigley is a small village and civil parish in
the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of
Cheshire, England. According to the 2001 census, the civil parish
and village has a population of 220. The nearest town is Bollington
to the southwest. The village has a Church of England primary
school with around 50 pupils. The school was founded in 1492 and
celebrated its 500th anniversary in 1992. The St Christopher's
Church is a Grade I listed building and dates back from the early
14th Century. Take a walk around the church yard, there's a lot of
interesting things to see here, with great views through the
tress.&lt;br /&gt;

There is a slightly closer parking space, which should be obvious
once you know the location, however if you can - walk it. There's
some great views along the way. Original cache contents: Log book,
pencils and a number of swaps. Hope you enjoy the cache - please
post some photos of your adventures! Final coords showed as being
correct to 5 meters, due to tree cover. I tried them a number of

We have A-Road Anarchy&lt;br/&gt;(cos there aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public&lt;br/&gt;transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick&lt;br/&gt;Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations. SideTracked started at Evesham&lt;br/&gt;station on August 10th 2007, placed by schnarff &amp; bikermel76.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took a while to get started, but is now spreading across the&lt;br/&gt;country! It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in&lt;br/&gt;the same way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and&lt;br/&gt;remember that in this day and age, public transport is under&lt;br/&gt;greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should&lt;br/&gt;be quick and easy grabs,&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it could&lt;br/&gt;cause alarm!!! (Particularly, please ensure that you aware of the&lt;br/&gt;new rules of 04/09/08 before hiding your Cache!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adlington Railway Station was manned for many years but is now unstaffed. The station building is now privately owned and there is no longer a ticket machine, so passengers must purchase their ticket on the train.&lt;br/&gt;According to Network Rail's route utilisation strategy Adlington is in the top 50 least used station with on average 0.9 person using each train, up by 0.4 on the previous year. This means that approximately 42 people use the station a day on weekdays with 37 on a Saturday and 6 on a Sunday. Despite this, almost every Northern Rail service calls at the station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opened by the London and North Western Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Service&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 14th December 2008 trains operate on an hourly pattern, terminating at Stoke on Trent (southbound) or Manchester Piccadilly (northbound). Some early morning/late night services originate/terminate at Macclesfield.&lt;br/&gt;Trains towards Stoke on Trent generally depart Adlington at xx11 (Monday to Saturday) with an additional evening peak service at 17.41 (Monday to Friday only). The last two services in an evening terminate at Macclesfield.&lt;br/&gt;Trains towards Manchester Piccadilly depart Adlington at xx27 Mondays to Saturdays, however services before 09.00 are significantly different (Monday to Friday) with departures at 06.29, 07.00, 07.25, 07.47 and 08.26.&lt;br/&gt;Northbound services towards Manchester Piccadilly generally call at Heaton Chapel and Levenshulme whereas Southbound services do not.&lt;br/&gt;There are three afternoon/evening services in each direction on Sundays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a 35mm Micro with Log book and pencil :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF - leakster &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Baden-Powell wrote the principles of Scouting in Scouting for Boys (London, 1908), based on his earlier military books, with influence and support of Frederick Russell Burnham (Chief of Scouts in British Africa), Seton of the Woodcraft Indians, Smith of the Boys' Brigade, and his publisher Pearson. During the first half of the 20th century, the movement grew to encompass three major age groups each for boys (Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Rover Scout) and, in 1910, a new organization, Girl Guides, was created for girls (Brownie Guide, Girl Guide and Girl Scout, Ranger Guide).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also at this hut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a 350ml container with a log book and a few goodies.

&lt;p&gt;We have Motorway Mayhem. We have A-Road Anarchy (cos there
aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public
transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in the same
way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and
remember that in this day and age, public transport is under
greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should
be quick and easy grabs, PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it
could cause alarm!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on SideTracked Caches, please visit
SideTracked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Strines&lt;/b&gt;


Strines is a village in Greater Manchester, located in the valley
of the River Goyt midway between Marple and New Mills and about six
miles southeast of Stockport. The village falls mainly within
Marple parish and Stockport metropolitan borough, though a small
part (including the railway station) falls within the boundaries of
New Mills and thus in the Borough of High Peak, Derbyshire.
Immediately surrounding Strines are the villages of Woodend, Hague
Bar and Brookbottom. Close by are the towns of Marple and New Mills
and the villages of Mellor and Rowarth. Nearby is the hamlet of
Turf Lea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is served by Strines railway station on the Hope Valley
Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Well done
to Rigsby's Mob for FTF!&lt;/strong&gt;

Is placed just off a public footpath between an old derelict cottage and the 'housing estate' built for the new series. Quite what a cottage is doing in the middle of this industrial park is a bit of a mystery. If anyone knows the history of it please leave comments. Also around the corner you can see the 'inside' of one of the houses and the pretend police station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is freely available nearby but watch for the double-yellow lines. Best time to visit is the evening or weekend as it's very quiet then apart from the odd pedestrian taking a shortcut down the path from Tesco to the nearby hospital and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small sandwich clip n' seal box large enough for coins and a few odds and ends. You'll need to be quite nimble to get to it and be careful of the brambles and nettles.</groundspeak:long_description>

A leftover from times gone by. Not sure what it was originally but it's lucky to have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware you're being watched by at least three cctv cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to other cachers we now know this is what remains of Brunswick Methodist Chapel (Wesleyan). Founded 1826. Registers 1826–1837 are at the Cheshire Record Office. Registers of marriages 1905–1953 are at Manchester Central Library.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;It is a small tub with a screw on lid, measuring about 7cm x 7cm
x 7cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is located about half a mile from the carpark at the end of
Maitland Avenue, located at N 53 25.418 W 002 16.002. (This is the
same car park as we suggest you use for Chorlton
Waterpark, though the cache is in the opposite direction.) The
car park gets locked round about dusk - check the sign, but there
is a small part of the car park outside the gate if you think you
will be staying later&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A small klik n' lock box accessible by wheelchair and well away from the gravestones. You don't have to leave the path to find this one. Please put the cache back carefully as the gardeners are quite keen. Of interest, in the direction of the Eastern chapel, is the Masonic pathway dating back to the late 1800's - look for the symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some famous graves to look out for while here are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alcock, John William. b.

Trust. Fairly good paths, a big hill by Warrington's standards!! &lt;br /&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is now a black flash can approx 10 inches
long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from Birchwood Forest Park, N53 25.611 W002 30.564 is
just under a mile walk to the cache. There are nearer parking
spots, but you don't get a nice walk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tupperware box is:- A bookmark&lt;br /&gt;
Woolston &amp; District Dog Show Rosette for 3rd best in show (My
dog Bracken!!)&lt;br /&gt;
Chinese Checkers Game (Don't know how to play?)&lt;br /&gt;
3 x Keep Warrington Tidy Ballons&lt;br /&gt;
3 x Multi-coloured Mersey Forest pencils&lt;br /&gt;
3 x Plain Mersey Forest pencils&lt;br /&gt;
PC/CD - The Way Things Work&lt;br /&gt;
Red Nose 2001 Pin Badge&lt;br /&gt;

Whats On in Warrington's Park's (Please leave for info)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Encounter is a new statue that is &quot;supposed&quot; to be bigger
than the Angel of the North. I will let you judge that for
yourself. (See photo or visit
www.birchwoodtowncouncil.org.uk/news/sculpture.htm for further
details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pestfurlong Hill is about as big as the hills get in Warrington,
however it is a good viewpoint of the local countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other caches in different Warrington Parks . Please
visit more of them as they are a good mixture of urban &amp; rural
parks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>With your back to Encounter, take the weight off your feet and rest on the bench.  The cache is deep in the trees to your left, but on the right hand side of the path.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Surprising how close to the roads &amp; estate this is, yet somehow manages to seem more rural than most parks.  Excellent cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is an interesting one because not only it has got a good view of flixton you can find a cache as well.You can also find two cache because not only mine is there.&lt;br/&gt;In this cache there is a lot to look at.There is a great view of Winter Hill.The cache is off a thin track and on the way there can be outbreaks of nettles and mud as well.The hardness of finding the cache is quite difficult (you might need to search around a bit in the grass).The container is a micro film container.If I was you if there was any children about anyone under 9 should ask there parents to get the cache due to nettles.Parking is quite close as there is lots of little passages to roads on the way.If you are walking then follow the footpath beyond the bridge and turn right at the end and get to the location.HAPPY HUNTING!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The annual Caribbean Carnival takes place in Alexandra Park, alongside regular amateur football games, 5K runs and health walks lead by the dedicated park wardens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For information regarding the regular 5K runs in Alexandra Park, please visit the Open Athletics - Alexandra Park webpage. The 5ks have been taking place since July 2005 and they are organised with the collaboration of the Friends of Alexandra Park. The runs are under UK Athletics Rules and the course is a certified accurate 5k course by UK Athletics. The race is ideal for novices, but it is also a fast course for experienced runners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Friends of Alexandra Park is a dedicated voluntary group of local residents founded in 2001. The group was set up to help change the image of the Park and to raise funds for the improvement of the Park. The Friends encourage people to make greater use of Alexandra Park, help the Park staff, and arrange and support events throughout the year.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, contact Friends of Alexandra Park:  FriendsofAlexandraPark@whalleyrange.org </groundspeak:long_description>

A local resident once laid a kind of path through it but this quickly became smothered with brambles... Recently a group of Community Payback workers put the site to rights removing all the undergrowth and thinning out the trees while a chainsaw artist created sculptured from the remaining tree stumps.

At the moment the paving stones where you park are covered in green algae and very, very slippy when wet Please take extra care &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed close to one of the great Manchester landmarks, the Manchester Ship Canal and offers a view of that modern temple to retail therapy, the Trafford Centre. It is also a few moments walk from one of the engineering marvels of the British Waterways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Barton Swing Aqueduct was designed by Sir Edward Leader Williams and opened in 1893. It carries the Bridgewater Canal over the Manchester Ship Canal as it passes through Barton-upon-Irwell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its closed position, the aqueduct allows canal traffic to pass along the Bridgewater Canal. However, when large vessels need to pass along the Ship Canal, the massive iron trough (234ft long and weighing 800 tonnes) can be swung through ninety degrees via a pivot mounted on a small, purpose-built island in the Ship Canal. Gates at either end of the trough retain around 800 tonnes of water within the trough; further gates on either bank retain water in their adjacent stretches of canal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This aqueduct is one of the original &quot;Seven Wonders of the Waterways&quot; as compiled by Robert Aickman (co-founder of the Inland Waterways Association) and published in his book Know Your Waterways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small tupperware container painted black and hidden at ground level</groundspeak:long_description>

I remember when this road used to go all the way through to the main road (before it was Trafford Boulevard). It used to be a great cut through when the bridge had swung and the main road was backed up with traffic.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This multi stage cache Takes you on a breif tour round north campus
of the University of Manchester (formally UMIST) The terrain should
be wheelchair accessible for all stages but there is a steep ramp
to get to the final stage, and for stage 1 the information is at
the top of about 5 steps. The cache container is quite small (large
micro or small small, room for geocoins etc but not much more)

&lt;p&gt;UMIST started life as the Manchester Mechanics Institute, later
becoming the Manchester Municipal School of Technology and later
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
(UMIST) In 2004 UMIST was merged with the Victoria University of
Manchester forming the combined University Of Manchester. Since the
merger North Campus as it is now known has been systematically run
down with the intention of selling most of it off for development,
This has not been very popular with a lot of staff and students at
UMIST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache takes you on a short tour of the campus showing off
some of the Architecture and sculptures that adorn the campus,
along with as many remnants form UMIST that have not yet been re
branded by the University of Manchester&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to show hidden
waypoints, The instructions for finding the coordinates are in the
way point descriptions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you may want to bring a calculator with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 takes you to the main entrance of what is now called the
Sackville street building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 is at a Giant Vimpto bottle, Vimpto was originally
invented in a small hut near to this sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 Archimedes is having a bath here, dont forget to stop by
and grab GC1TKAH while you are here (the waypoint coords are GZ for
GC1TKAH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 4 Jackson's Mill was originally a cotton mill as the name
suggests, now it houses some of Chemical Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 5 The Ferranti Building houses the High Voltage Lab for
testing power components, much of the work here is done on behalf
of national grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 6. The Pariser building houses the school of Mechanical
Aeorospace and Civil Engineering (MACE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 7, The now defunct Faraday tower Used to hold maths and
Social Silences, but since the merger they have been moved to
oxford road. The building cannot be reused due to large quantities
of asbestos used in construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final stage, The cache is located near the George Begg building
which houses some of MACE and is the home of the Formula Student
team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In case you have printed this without hidden waypoints I have
repeated them here&lt;/h4&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gates of&lt;br/&gt; Ashton In Makerfield&lt;br/&gt; Golf Club.&lt;br/&gt;Club History&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; Long time cricketing pals Tom Mayall and Andrew Molyneux were discussing their fragile sporting futures against a backcloth of creeping age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sadness tinged Tom’s voice as he said quietly: “The bottom line is that we’ve both got too old for cricket.” “Tell you what,” replied Andrew decisively, “let’s take up golf and see if we can spoil a good walk.”“We can do better than that,” declared Tom. “You know there’s been talk for a good while about starting a golf club for staff at the Garswood Hall Collieries. Maybe now’s the time to do it.“I’ll go along with that,” said Andrew Molyneux and they both laughed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So it was that together with a small group of enthusiasts, the two old friends gave birth to the Ashton-In-Makerfield Golf Club in the second year of the 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; he 1906 clubhouse that replaced the building destroyed by firev in January of that year. The first meeting in connection with the formation of the club took place on February 18, 1902, with some 15 enthusiasts attending. Andrew Molyneux was appointed Captain. A small clubhouse was erected as early as April of that year and members rallied round the two pioneers. Among those who formed a steering committee, in addition to Messrs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tom Mayall who was elected secretary, and the Captain, were J.H. Edmondson, W.A. Gilby, R.H. Bell, R. Cunliffe, J.W. Mayall, L. Law, and R.H. Edmondson (Managing Director of the Garswood Colliery company) who was elected President.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The steely “Dunkirk Spirit” that typified those early members at Bryn stood the club in good stead in the face of several disasters. The first of these struck only four years later when in January 1906 the first clubhouse was gutted by fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Some members, naturally, wrung their hands in despair as the crackling flames consumed the very heart of their beloved golf club; others inspired by the irresistible “Old Bryn resolve,” set to with a will and within three months a new, bigger clubhouse was brought into use. However, the dangers inherent in occupying colliery land surfaced in the late 1950s when opencast mining reduced the Old Bryn course from nine holes to six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Without being over indulgent, Ashton members accepted a generous offer from the Dean Wood club of courtesy of the course Monday to Friday. A similar offer was made by Haydock Park Golf Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But the thunderclouds had gathered over the Old Bryn Course – and in the early 1960s they burst with devastating effect. The mighty Lancashire County Council announced without warning that they intended to develop the Old Bryn course and surrounding land and would if necessary invoke a Compulsory Purchase Order to achieve their aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; That decision brought on the Club’s biggest dilemma to date. Now even the members’ most steely resolve would be put to the test. This was the end for the Old Bryn course. Ashton Golf Club would have to find a new home – whether they liked the idea or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A silver lining among the dark clouds was the fact that the club had been fortunate enough in 1946 to have purchased the Bryn course land from the Garswood Hall Colliery at the original price of £750. The fact that the Club owned the land when the Lancashire County Council moved in was vital in that it enabled the Club to negotiate compensation totalling £28, 900.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tom Mayall&lt;br/&gt; Andrew Molyneux&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Co-founders of Ashton In Makerfield golf club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Had they not been the owners, compensation would have been minimal and Ashton Golf Club would have ceased to exist. Members’ feelings about the enforced move were mixed. Many harboured fond memories of humble, homely, happy Bryn where everybody knew everybody else-and rarely passed without a cheerful word. They remembered how, late at night, the last member out of the clubhouse locked up and hung the key on a nail in the toilet; they recalled how members, working to a rota, carried out various duties in the clubhouse in the service of the general membership and they remembered the congenial atmosphere engendered by a roaring open fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; On the other hand, there were those who relished the idea of leaving the Old Bryn site with its doubtful environment, ugly slag tips and inadequate facilities. The search for a new home to replace Old Bryn created anxious times for both officials and members. The Club Captain and Council were involved in numerous protracted meetings. But not for the first time, many of those anxieties were transcended by the members’ unique determination that made light of what initially appeared to be insurmountable barriers. “We’ve got to move across town, so lets’ get on with it”, was the members’ battle cry, one member, Harold Winstanley, recalls. Eventually agreement was reached with Lord Gerard to buy 60 acres of his Garswood Hall Estate for £5000 - an unbelievable bargain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When the move to Garswood Park got under way in 1965 it was a unique sight to see senior members of the club travelling through Ashton in an open truck, transferring furniture and equipment to Garswood Park in time for opening day. The County Council had forbidden the Club to remove any turf from Bryn, but when residents of the Mucklow housing estate started turfing their lawns, the Club decided to join in and a small quantity of turf was transferred to Garswood Park. The top inch of turf was pure coal dust accounting for black feet and clothing after a game of golf at Bryn. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache hidden near Worsley station on the old Tyldesley
     and Roe Green Loop line. &lt;br /&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;I would recommend parking in Monton where there is a free car
park which is protected with security cameras. This can be found at
53° 29.473N, 002° 21.086W [&lt;b&gt;SJ 76780 99453&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On foot Exit the car park and turn right up the high street
towards the roundabout. Cross the road at the roundabout to the
shelter on the other side onto Broad Oak Road a short walk up Broad
Oak Road leads to a public footpath which crosses Worsley Golf
Club. Walk up this foot path to where it splits and take the left
hand branch straight across the top end of the golf course. Follow
this path until it comes onto Chatsworth Road, turn left onto
Chatsworth Road and follow that for a very short distance down a
hill to a footpath sign. Join this footpath and from there I think
let your GPS do the talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache contains the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logbook and Pencil c/w rubber and a sharpener. Padlock and keys,
3 balloons, UV marker pen, mini keyring calculator, clip, 3 x
paperclips, mini craft pegs, and a thimble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice walk back to your car is along the line in a southerly
direction back towards Monton village.&lt;/p&gt;

   entrance is at the end of the road. Go through the gate (Sign
   says Wardley Woods) and take the path to the left, cross 2 small
   bridges and pass a small pond on the right up a small rise where
   the cache is somewhere in the wooded area ahead but off the

It has an area of 596½ acres.  The western boundary is formed by the Syd Brook, which flows north. The surface rises eastward from this brook, with many undulations, heights of 275 ft. being attained on the southern border and 250 ft. in the centre. There is no village; the hamlet of Whittle Green is near the north-west corner. The population in 1901 numbered 105.&lt;br/&gt;The road from Wigan to Preston cuts through the edge of the township; from it Mill Lane leads west to the green, the brook and the mill. There are mineral railways, serving the collieries.&lt;br/&gt;In 1666 there were twenty-four hearths chargeable to the tax; no house had more than two hearths. &lt;br/&gt;Manor&lt;br/&gt;As a member of the barony of Penwortham WELCH WHITTLE was, with Shevington and Charnock, granted to Randle son of Roger, and descended to Ferrers and the 'lords of Leylandshire,' as described under Shevington. A subordinate manor, assessed as 4 oxgangs, was held by Gilbert son of Reinfred, and descended to his son, William de Lancaster.  It was given as part of her marriage portion to Alice wife of Roger de Leicester, and sold before 1221 to Richard le Waleys of Uplitherland. Not long afterwards it was held by the Sankey family, from whom it descended to the Torbocks, but was by Henry de Torbock in 1365 given to Geoffrey de Wrightington, apparently as a reward for his share in securing the verdict of the jury in the great contest for the family estates waged between Henry and Sir William Carles. Later it descended like Wrightington.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;coat of arms..&lt;br/&gt;Torbock. Or, an eagle's leg erased at the thigh gules, on a chief indented azure three plates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From: 'Townships: Welch Whittle', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 6 (1911), pp. 203-204. .</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At the head of Yarrow Reservoir is an area named Meeting Of The Waters.  Unsuprisingly, two rivers meet here - Limestone Brook and the River Yarrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The River Yarrow is in Lancashire, with its source at an area called Will Narr at Hordern Stoops, along Spitlers Edge - the Chorley/Blackburn boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limestone Brook has its source near to Devils Ditch, and flows via Shooting Huts on Anglezarke moor where it travels through Lead Mines Clough before joining the Yarrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This spot is very near to Lollybob's ace BMR2 cache - too close, in fact, if you follow GC.COM's proximity rules (there's a natural boundary in the river, but there's a bridge).  Meeting Of The Waters is a spot that many have walked past, but I dare say that few have visited.  Take some photos from the waters edge, and post them on your log!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Go to the waters edge at the tip where the waters meet. Back from the edge, equidistant from the two waters, is a large tree with a horizontal leg sticking out from it. It's at the base of this tree. The tree is on a step-change in elevation.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The shamrock (?) is a symbol of Ireland. It is a three-leafed old white clover.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The name shamrock is derived from Irish seamróg, which is the diminutive version of the Irish word for clover (seamair).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is sometimes of the variety Trifolium repens (white clover, Irish: seamair bhán) but today usually Trifolium dubium (lesser clover, Irish: seamair bhuí). However, other three-leafed plants—such as Medicago lupulina, Trifolium pratense, and Oxalis—are sometimes designated as shamrocks. The shamrock was traditionally used for its medical properties and was a popular motif in Victorian times.</groundspeak:long_description>

These particular ruins are marked as such on the older OS maps (1950's edition), but as they are in such a state of disrepair, they've been removed from modern editions. There's actually very little in terms of the farm to see here, but you can get a feel for the outline of the buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's more important, perhaps, is that this is a very nice spot, where the River Yarrow flows, with a stream adjoining at this point too. It's a secluded little valley that would have been one of the more hospitable parts of the moors. I certainly wouldn't mind a nights camping here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a turtle container with small trinkets inside. </groundspeak:long_description>

Demolished by the Liverpool Corporation, aka the water board, as old farm buildings were deemed as being bad for water purity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular property was one of several given up by Mr G. M. Dixon of the Liverpool Corporation in 1922. The location is near to Peewet Hall, and was farmed by members of the Cocker (of the famous Moses Cocker and his flying machine) family in the 1700s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the early 1800s this was owned by the Pilkington's along with the landmark farm near Great Hill, Drinkwaters. Mr Dixon wrote to the Lord Mayor, Alderman and Citizens of the City of Liverpool, stating &quot;I give notice to quit all lands I hold under Liverpool Corporation on February End, 1923..... owing to the high rates and the heavy slump in prices, especially wool, the chief thing on a hill farm.&quot; </groundspeak:long_description>

Pulled the web page up on the mobile and put the numbers in my GPSr and it was only 0.38 mile away. Locked the car and off I went taking the path from Alance Bridge climbing onto the moors and then across a field towards GZ passing a couple who had just made it up the hill from Lead Mines. On arriving at GZ looked around and spotted a likely hide so took a seat next to it and bingo we have a turtle. Signed the log and replaced the cache. Took in the views while composing myself for the walk back and updating my status on that facebook thingy. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Anglezarke Moor is Open Access land, with full Right To Roam rights - and some of the &quot;secret&quot; paths are actually better trodden than the marked ROWs.&lt;br/&gt;This gate has always been a so-called access point above Lead Mines Clough. I say 'so-called' as it doesn't appear to be an access point to anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I walked through it a couple of years ago, and presumed the gate was redundant, as you are confronted by a wall of conifer (or are you?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On walking up here a few weeks back, the gate has been renewed, complete with substantial concrete ballasts. It's obviously current, and of use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not on the maps, although it is next to the Secret Path that runs around the outer edge of Lead Mines woodland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question is... why is it here, and where does it go?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a turtle container.</groundspeak:long_description>

Anglezarke Moor is Open Access land, with full Right To Roam rights - and some of the &quot;secret&quot; paths are actually better trodden than the marked ROWs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an area where there is supposed to be a Holy Well. In ancient times, there probably was, but the structure of ground around it has since disappeared. There are water pools here, so there's no doubt that you are in the right location, but nothing jumps out as being of great religious value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy wells were so named because they were reputed to have healing properties. For instance, if a walker had an aching foot, they could dip it in the water and supposedly it would heal. </groundspeak:long_description>

A level crossing, no longer in use, is still in place at the station entrance as well as a pedestrian subway which emerges at the foot of the Railway Pub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trans Pennine Express and Northern trains serve the station, with trains going to Manchester, Manchester Airport, Blackpool, and Glasgow/Edinburgh as well as other smaller local stations inbetween.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The station is handy for all the local shops and of course pubs, of which there are some really good ones nearby</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There are lots of little gems hidden in this park and there is
plenty of room for caches so we stuck one in for you.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Worden Park is located at the southern edge of the town of Leyland
and at the southern boundary of the borough of South Ribble,
approximately seven miles south of Preston. It is the largest and
most prestigious park in South Ribble and one of the most popular
parks in Lancashire, receiving on average over ¼ million visitors
every year. The park was first opened to the public as part of the
Festival of Britain celebrations and is now is listed Grade II by
English Heritage on its Register of Parks and Gardens of Special
Historic Interest. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the published coordinates but you will need
to put them in your GPS for a bit of jiggery pokery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goto Stage1 and read the plaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the park open to the public? answer 'abcd'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now remember the original coordinates? good! project a waypoint
from them 'd'km and 'abc' degrees and the cache should be yours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For those of you who have a Garmin Etrex and want to know how
to project a way point Click

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sheep shearing and wool production in the UK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheep shearing and wool production has been an important part of the UK's sheep industry over the last six thousand years. The earliest sheep had pigmented coats and moulted allowing farmers to collect the fallen wool but as time went on breeds developed with improved wool characteristics. By the middle ages wool was the UK's most important output, being exported throughout Europe. Later, as exports declined, production was used domestically in the fast growing cloth industries where technological advance fueled the industrial revolution and the move from an agrarian to urban society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wool is a modified form of hair that grows with a waviness (called the crimp) which is characteristic of the breed of sheep. Fleeces of British sheep can be classified into three main types: carpet wools, down wools and long wools each with differing end uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many centuries wool was the UK's most important export and through the cloth trade led to the development of many of the nation's industrial towns. Today the UK remains an important producer (7th largest in the world) exporting around one third of the annual 60,000 tonne clip. However, with wool prices at about 50 pence per kilogram the value of the raw wool that is exported is little more than £10 million and for most farmers the value of the wool does not cover the cost of shearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheep are either sheared in the early summer months, or immediately prior to winter housing. Since sheep breeds no longer naturally moult, shearing is necessary to prevent the animal from overheating either when indoors, or outside during hot summer months. When shorn, sheep are also much less prone to fly strike. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheep are usually shorn on a wooden board that can easily be cleaned through the shearing process to avoid faecal contamination of the fleece. Fleeces can also be spoiled by marker paint, brambles and other contaminants - all of which lower the value.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This virtual cache can be found in Witch Wood, one of Lytham St Annes' hidden gems, which runs along the railway line from Ansdell to Lytham. The wood is an outlying part of a much larger system of woodland on the former Clifton family estate around Lytham Hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wood contains several indigenous species of tree including oak, ash, beech, horse chestnut, birch and rowan. In recent years a number of attractive carved sculptures have been added. However your task is to find one of the oldest man-made structures in the wood. On this structure there is a date. Add the year, month and day of the month, to get the code phrase (a four-digit number).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wood can be walked in two parts - Ansdell to the Clifton family's carriage track (the cache is in this part), then on to Lytham. Note that there are existing paths all the way to ground zero. You should not have to walk through bushes or undergrowth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on the wood, see the website of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lsacivic.org/&quot;&gt;Lytham St Annes Civic Society&lt;/a&gt; .         </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This open field surrounded by woodland is something of a mystery. Little is known about why this area has been kept clear of trees, or what the walled structure alongside it was used for. One suggestion is that working horses were contained and allowed to graze here, as the woodland throughout the valley is known to have been coppiced and used for charcoal production in the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in Hardcastle Crags are a new way for people to explore this beautiful area and find out more about its nature and history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge. (There is a charge for parking in the National Trust car park if you aren’t a member).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. The footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather. Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2. Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet. &lt;br/&gt;3. Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths. &lt;br/&gt;4. Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located close to an old packhorse route - one of many ancient paved routes known as ‘causeys’ that criss-cross the landscape of the Pennines. Laden packhorse trains made up of about a dozen horses could transport goods thirty miles a day using these routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Trust geocaches in Hardcastle Crags are a new way for people to explore this beautiful area and find out more about its nature and history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocaches are all located near public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge. (There is a charge for parking in the National Trust car park if you aren’t a member).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some geocaches may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. The footpaths can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather. Wellies or walking boots are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;2. Many areas have trip hazards – so watch where you put your feet. &lt;br/&gt;3. Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths. &lt;br/&gt;4. Please keep an eye out for rubbish, stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the plants (e.g. bluebells in spring). It would be wise to use a stick when looking for the geocache, rather than your hands.&lt;br/&gt;5.

The cache contains a log and a few trinkets, but bring your own pen/pencil - hope you enjoy it !

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;We've been meaning to walk this FP with a view to placing a cache for ages and having decided not to go on an epic trek today, thought we'd do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can get muddy at the lower parts of the path, but otherwise, it's fine and affords the walker some very nice views across the Fylde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you approach this cache from the M55 roundabout at Wyndyke Farm, you'll appreciate the view out to Staining windmill enroute to the cache site - see below.&lt;/p&gt;

Also take some cash as the cafe and pubs in town are all excellent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache and hiding material securely out of sight... thx... :) </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;Brigsteer Park is a lovely wood on the rising side of the Lyth Valley. Six caches form a circular walk, which can be linked into the nearby Helsington caches, and Sizergh Castle. Boots/wellies are recommended!&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woods cover the steep side of the valley as the limestone rises up to Helsington and Scout Scar. An old wood with a variety of trees, flora and fauna covering the stepped slope. The National Trust are carrying out maintenance work to revive the wood, create a variety of habitats within it and encourage diversity. The caches are hidden with the kind permission of the NT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small parking area can be found in the SE corner of the wood, where the road enters. We suggest doing this cache first, so from the parking, go onto the road again, then follow the sign to Cinderbarrow SW across the open field and through a squeeze stile out onto the small road. Down the road to a track on the right, which runs along the W side of the farm, before dropping down to the flat valley floor. Good views of Arnside, Whitbarrow and the far hills as you come down the fields and along the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hilly geology is limestone. Most of the rain water runs through the rock in cracks and bedding planes, and some emerges in small streams near the valley bottom. Along the track you will find an interesting waterfall. Dissolved minerals are being precipitated on the stream bed.&lt;br /&gt;
Be gentle finding and rehiding the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Yew, continue south-east, bear right and follow round to the info point and the gate back to the parking. On the way is a bowl on the left with a big ash tree. The cache is near the top of the tree, approx. 14m from the base! Take care!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief history of the wood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Historically managed as a coppice. Species variety indicates the area has had woodland over a very long term if not always so. Historical references are few, only oral history and some small reference in the black file of 1950 woodland information by the Strickland . There are signs of charcoal pitsteads in the wood but these seem few in number when compared to similar sized areas in more Lake District woods.There are signs of timber felling having taken place during both the First and Second World Wars, this is backed up by oral evidence and visual evidence of oak stumps. Some timber was also felled here in the coppice clearances for planting in the 1960's. The woodland was extensively felled during the early 1940's and this is probably when the timber was taken out. The larger untouched hazel stocks in the wood date back to re-growth of this period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the late 1950's the last coppice products were sold from the wood, except for some firewood and a small number of net stakes for the Flookburgh fishermen up to the ending of the clearings in 1973. The late 50's produce was birch for the brush factory in Kendal. These were turned into brush heads. Firewood and ash rails were sold locally. Fish net stakes were cut in a small way as they had to be perfectly straight for use on the Bay. These were cut mainly from hazel. Oral history says that much of the coppice from here was used for turnery, ship's fenders and pea sticks etc. All that was left at the end were a few pieces of twigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will pass a few basic shelters, made a few years ago by Levens School, feel free to add to them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Sam, NT Ranger at Sizergh, for permission for placing these caches. Don't forget to visit the NT caches nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
Hope you enjoy your trip to Brigsteer Park Woods and don't forget the event in December at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC3XM4K&quot;&gt;Castle&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The wood supplied the castle with some of the fuel (charcoal and firewood) required to power it, as well as providing essential building materials, kitchen equipment, hunting grounds and many other life essentials.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;Brigsteer Park is a lovely wood on the rising side of the Lyth Valley. Six caches form a circular walk. Boots/wellies are recommended!&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;From No.4 Gate, go south briefly and then up the obvious rising path. At the 'top' where the path levels off, a smaller path branches off to the right in the direction of the cache. You will pass some clearings and new fenced coppice areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The fenced areas are the coppice coupes, the fences are required to protect the trees from the high number of deer in the area (Roe and Red) which would browse the young leaves, eventually killing the trees. The fences are just temporary, 2-3 years just to give the trees a start, we will then move the fences to the next areas. As part of the management a contractor called Gareth does a lot of the work. Through the grants he has been able to set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodmatters.org.uk&quot;&gt;Wood Matters&lt;/a&gt;.  He operates a community wood fuel scheme where people can offer their help for a day of work in the woods in return they will receive some wood fuel. He also runs green wood craft workshops.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; NT &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GPS should identify the right tree that yew need.  Bring an athletic team member for this cache, but it's not too tricky and quite 'enclosed' on the NW side.  Strangely there is no local golf course.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;Brigsteer Park is a lovely wood on the rising side of the Lyth Valley. Six caches form a circular walk. Boots/wellies are recommended!&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the Waterfall cache, head down the track to the gate into the woods on the corner.  Follow the track along the bottom of the wood; there are muddy/boggy sections - boots or wellies are a good idea!.  New clearings have been made along here to catch the sun, and it's a great spot for butterflies - not so great in 2012 with the wet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;We have done a lot of work in Brigsteer recently through a Woodland Grant that we received from the Forestry Commission and Butterfly Conservation. The idea is to re-establish the coppice cycle, which is how the wood would have been managed for hundreds of years prior to the second world war. The coppice cycle breaks up the canopy and allows areas of more sunlight to get to woodland floor, which is essential for the life cycle of both woodland butterflies (particularly High Brown Fritillary) and their food (violets, bramble etc). The plan is to create a mosaic of coppice coupes which are all connected with open rides which allows the butterflies and other insects to move through out the woodland and beyond hopefully linking the landscape as a whole.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;  NT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant walk, an obvious path comes down from the right and just past it is Simm Well.  This is another resurgence of the underground water.  Depending on recent weather there will be more or less water 'springing' to the surface, which then flows west out of the wood.  A few metres west of the path, the stream forms a small pool, which Safie likes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is behind the spring in a raised 'quarry' area: man-made or eroded by the spring? Watch where you're standing - don't trample the plants. Please be gentle searching.&lt;br /&gt;

The trees were planted in small woodlands or coupes in the field to provide browsing and protect game birds such as pheasants. Trees were also planted individually to improve the view from the castle, but also provide the deer and sheep with some protection. In the open spaces there are some beautiful parkland trees, they are not especially big, but they do have a classic shape. When trees are planted in the parkland they don’t have to compete for light; they grow outwards as well as upwards and usually develop a broad canopy and strong limbs. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Fairly soon, after a clearing or two, you may notice pine trees on the left (W) of the path.  It's an area of old 'plantation' woodland, very different from the ash, yew, hazel and oak in most of the wood.  The pines are now quite old and reach a good height.  Their needles carpet the floor and near the cache site you can sneak views out into the light of the farmland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trees do make the GPS signal a little wayward, but a spoiler pic and a good hint should help. Be gentle with the camouflage and replace carefully.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache trail is within a small part of the Sizergh Castle - which was donated to the National Trust in 1950 by the Strickland family, who still reside in the castle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to park in the castle car park (which is free), all the caches are outside of the pay barrier so there is no need to pay an entrance fee - unless you want to!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the estate, its castle and village - Sizergh - originates from Scandinavian occupation in the ninth or tenth century, and meaning the summer pasture or dairy farm of Sigarith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The estate is 638 hectares and has a tradition of dairy farming which continues today. The estate farmland originally provided not only a setting for the castle, but also a source of income for its owners. This is still true, although much of the estate is now managed for the conservation of its ancient woodland and flower-rich limestone grassland, both supporting a great diversity of flora and fauna, including many of national note.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rash Springs is an ancient woodland in miniature. It has a canopy of large Oak and Beech trees, with a shrub layer of hazel, field maple and rowan. The woodland floor is also amazing, the dappled sunlight allowing spring and early summer flowers to thrive – primroses, herb Robert, dog’s mercury, wood avens and lord and ladies. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Pines continue to the end of the wood, where a kissing gate gives access into the field. Choices now: head up to Park End Farm, then up the hill to Helsington, passing the big resurgence at Wells Garth, then follow the bridleway back down the long stepped ridge to the wood parking. Or, continue this circuit by back-tracking briefly and take the rising path up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC3XHKA&quot;&gt;No.5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache may prove a bit tricky if there's no sign of it. It's not in the wall and no stones need moving. Hopefully, it's not too frustrating!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is hidden in Scroggs Wood, an area of (ancient?) woodland marking part of the southern border of Kendal. The woodland is managed by the Woodland Trust and links to a larger section of wood along the river Kent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The section of the wood along the river is a SSSI - this section is not, but please respect the woodland and don't take any short cuts - you really don't need to! There's a bridge across the beck where it meets the river, at the bottom of the lane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'd recommend exploring the riverside path, either towards Kendal (turn left at the river) or towards Sedgewick (turn right) and take in some or all of Safie's Sedgewick Saunter or Safie's West Bank Wander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a small car parking area (enough for 2 cars) specifically for the wood just off the A6 by the Hadwins used car dealership. There's also a small area down the lane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache box itself may not be totally waterproof. It might get damp. Please put&lt;br/&gt;things into the little plastic bags inside. Just in case!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget to check out the Geocaching Association of Great Britain (http://www.gagb.co.uk) &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

to enable it to be hidden in sight of all passers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The co-ordinates are for
the end of the wall and not the cache itself, gps fixes were taken
over several days at different times of day and
averaged.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to reflect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Follow your GPS to the co-ordinates and have a look around, you
will find the cache very close by, it is not hidden in the wall, if
you need more help use the hint.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;There are offices and
private residences close by so you will need to be stealthy in your
retrieval.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Area History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gooseholme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gooseholme used to be an island between two branches of the
river Kent, one of these is now filled in. The branches joined
again just above the mill race for Kendal Mill and there was
probably also a conduit to feed the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
The area is now a public park with an 18 hole putting green. There
are also several benches along the river bank where you can sit and
listen to the gentle sound of the water passing by.&lt;br /&gt;
On the east bank next to the weir there is a kiosk that serves hot
and cold snacks and beverages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aynam Mills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severely gutted by fire in 1983, but re-built and now occupied
by local businesses. Originally housed the Illingworth Snuff
factory, which closed after the fire.&lt;br /&gt;
The buildings across the road from the cache were once The Aynam
Woollen Mill and was occupied in 1873 by George J McKay, at the
time was described as a woollen merchant and horse-clothing
manufacturer. The buildings were once occupied by a garage, but
more recently by South Lakes Housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filled in mill race:&lt;/strong&gt; If you stand near the
Scout's flag pole looking south you can see a car park, this was
originally a mill race, some 40 feet wide, and about 20 feet
deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mill race bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the Southern mill
race bridge, designed by Francis Webster and built in 1818. The
bridge had four arches and carried traffic from Kent Street, across
Miller Bridge and on into Canal Head. Only the bridge's parapet can
now be seen, with the rest of the bridge buried beneath the
car-park and the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second mill race bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the Northern
mill race bridge, possibly built about the same time as the
Southern bridge. Again it has been buried with only the parapets
remaining visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1st Kendal Scouts&lt;/h3&gt;
The hut next to the wall you will sit on is owned by the 1st Kendal
Scouts, Who can be traced back to 1911, just four years since the
formation of the Scout Movement.&lt;br /&gt;
At that time they were the 1st Kendal (Lady Bagot's Own) and each
year the lads would pull their trek-cart down to Levens Hall to be
inspected by their patron.&lt;br /&gt;
It is know that during the First World War the members of the troop
helped at the rehabilitation hospital for wounded soldiers in
Kendal. In pairs they also guarded the railway bridges on the main
line.&lt;br /&gt;
If they enemy attacked, one Scout had to run back into Kendal to
call out the militia!
&lt;p&gt;The Group was lost track of until it was reformed in the 1950's
and met for sometime at the YMCA in Highgate and at various other
venues. Then a dynamic group of parents helped to fund and build
their own Headquarters on Little Aynam in Kendal - where they are
today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Please help keep this area tidy and CITO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is our first hide, hope you enjoy it :-)&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Serpentine Woods looks over Kendal towards the town and the
castle.&lt;br /&gt;
A sculpture trail was placed in Serpentine Woods during the 1970s,
but fell into decay. A new trail was opened in 2007. The woods were
originally grazing land and part of Kendal Fell. The area was
historically called &lt;i&gt;Dob Frear&lt;/i&gt;, which is supposedly Old Norse
for Free Land. The wood has long been open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council have asked that I point out that there is the golf
course to the West and North and a nature conservation area to the
North. &lt;i&gt;If you plan on taking in a few of the nearby
Roboes’ caches, or heading over to Cunswick scar, Please
stick to the marked paths&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start, I want you to have a little look into the
history of the woods. So your first clue is an armchair (or
library?) clue. In what year was the summerhouse within the wood
built? The answer may also be available at the summerhouse itself.
(&lt;i&gt;N54 19.672 W002 45.267&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;=first digit + last digit Check – add all
numbers to get 15&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of parking in Kendal town centre, but
you’ll have to climb Beast Banks, and you might never find
your way back out of the one-way system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates given are approximate due to the tree cover. It
should be obvious what you are looking for, so accuracy isn’t
that important. If you want a little extra help, a guide to the
alphabet trail is available at the Kendal Tourist Information
Centre (N54 19.614 W002 44.842).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The letters used for each clue correspond to the initial
letter of the relevant sculpture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some may be high.&lt;br /&gt;
Some may be low.&lt;br /&gt;
Others may be obvious,&lt;br /&gt;
Some not quite so.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your starting point is &lt;i&gt;The Tram&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;N54 19.724 W002
45.201&lt;/i&gt;). This is a very unusual name, especially as Kendal
never had trams. I’ve tried to discover something of the
Etymology of the name. The first record is of ‘Tram
Close’ a small parcel of land sold in 1746.&lt;br /&gt;
A short distance Northwest of here is an old mint cake quarry,
which fell out of use following the invention of a synthetic
alternative that was much cheaper to produce. The Quiggins factory
at the foot of Beast Banks is on the site of the original mint cake
refinery. I suspect what is now the bridleway may have been a
tramway to get the raw cake down to the refinery. However, there is
no evidence for this tramway other than the name and the route of
the bridleway.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the gate. You’ll see a large seed.&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the plant this will grow into?  
 &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.721 W002 45.209&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the path to a large tree at a junction of paths.&lt;br /&gt;
How many bolts hold the creature to the tree?  
 &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.724 W002 45.269&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go round to the left. Continue past the little folk’s
swimming pool.&lt;br /&gt;
How many vertical parts?    &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.715 W002 45.342&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-back along the higher path. Keep looking all
around.&lt;br /&gt;
How many leaves?    &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.736 W002 45.354&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry on to the end of this path and turn left.&lt;br /&gt;
How many legs on this bench?    &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.792 W002 45.381&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many Magpies?     &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.797 W002 45.416&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the path, past the Nest by GCNQQ9,
Wainwright’s Kendal View.&lt;br /&gt;
Continue to follow the path round to the left, past a wise old
bird. Rest your weary feet on the Pheasant if you so wish. Watch
out for the Rat and the Spider. Go round to the left and through
the Tunnel to a junction of lots of paths.&lt;br /&gt;
If its raining you could stay dry here under a tree that sounds
just like this letter, possibly. How many radial arms?  
  &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.705 W002 45.382&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the right hand path – the least obvious path.&lt;br /&gt;
How many petals?     &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N 54 19.676 W002 45.387&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a musical interlude.&lt;br /&gt;
How many notes on the instrument?     &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N 54 19.675 W002 45.334&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;cache&lt;/i&gt; is at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.U(X+M)(C+G)&lt;br /&gt;
W002 45.ASV&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick check that you’ve got the right numbers:&lt;br /&gt;
A+C+G+I+S = 24&lt;br /&gt;
L+M+U+V+X = 26&lt;br /&gt;
The item referred to in the clue is nearby, but the clue is
intended to give a little help as the gps is likely to be a bit out
with the tree cover. The cache coordinates were averaged over two
three-minute sessions, so should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summerhouse referred to in the armchair clue is just down
the steps to the north of X, and turn right. (&lt;i&gt;N54 19.672 W002
45.267&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
Following this path past the summerhouse will bring you out of the
woods at the top of Serpentine Road. Turn left along the road to
get back to The Tram. Alternatively, explore the woods some more
– you’ll soon come to a familiar landmark.&lt;/p&gt;

He was one of the most notorious of Viking kings with an heroic reputation for success in battle both in Norway and overseas. Eric’s luck finally ran out at Stainmore when his Viking army were heavily defeated. Bloodaxe, along with five other loyal Viking leaders, lost their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point where Eric Bloodaxe met his death is marked by the ancient Rey Cross. The cross was set up by Edmund, King of Northumbria to mark the boundary between Northumbria, England and Strathclyde, Scotland. It was, originally, a wheel0headed cross, which stood around en feet high and had carvings down two sides of the shaft, but all that is left now, is the top part of the shaft and the base plinth. The carvings can no longer be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rey Cross once stood a little west of its current location, on the south-side of the road, in the Roman Marching Camp, but was moved when the road was widened and now stands on the north-side of the road and can be access from the east-bound carriage-way only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rey is a Viking word which means boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is only big enough for a log book and a small pencil but you may need to bring your own pen/pencil as the pencil we included is not very big.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please sign the log with name and date only please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache in exactly the same location and orientation as you find it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Pencaitand Railway Walk follows the route formerly taken by the Gifford and Garvald Light Railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line orginally opened in 1901 and used for both passenger and goods transport.  The line ran from a fork at Monktonhall where it connected to the main East Coast Line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to it's name the line never quite made it Garvald, only stretching as far as Gifford.  There were stations at Ormiston (Macmerry on a seperate branch line), Pencaitland, Salton, Humbie and Gifford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goods transported on the line were agricultural produce, coal and the whiskey produced at Glenkinchie Distillery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenkinchie Distillery has been operating (legally) since 1837 when it was operated by George Rate &amp; Sons.  It was closed in 1853 then reopened by a consortium of Edinburgh merchants who created the Glenkinchie Distillery Co. Ltd.  In 1914 it became part of Scottish Malt Distillers and subsequently Diageo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not intended on placing a cache this far up the Railway Walk as Jack Aubrey &amp; Firth of Forth had one up here but i noticed it had recently been archived.

The Yew Tree

 My bonnie yew tree
     Tell me what did you see

 A mile frae Pentcaitland, on the road to the sea
 Stands a yew tree a thousand years old
 And the old women swear by the grey o' their hair
 That it knows what the future will hold
 For the shadows of Scotland stand round it
 'Mid the kail and the corn and the kye
 All the hopes and the fears of a thousand long years
 Under the Lothian sky

 Did you look through the haze o' the lang summer days
 Tae the South and the far English border
 A' the bonnets o' steel on Flodden's far field
 Did they march by your side in good order
 Did you ask them the price o' their glory
 When you heard the great slaughter begin
 For the dust o' their bones would rise up from the stones
 To bring tears to the eyes o' the wind

 Not once did you speak for the poor and the weak
 When the moss-troopers lay in your shade
 To count out the plunder and hide frae the thunder
 And share out the spoils o' their raid
 But you saw the smiles o' the gentry
 And the laughter of lords at their gains
 When the poor hunt the poor across mountain and moor
 The rich man can keep them in chains

 Did you no' think tae tell when John Knox himsel'
 Preached under your branches sae black
 To the poor common folk who would lift up the yoke
 O' the bishops and priests frae their backs
 But you knew the bargain he sold them
 And freedom was only one part
 For the price o' their souls was a gospel sae cold
 It would freeze up the joy in their hearts

 And I thought as I stood and laid hands on your wood
 That it might be a kindness to fell you
 One kiss o' the axe and you're freed frae the racks
 O' the sad bloody tales that men tell you
 But a wee bird flew out from your branches
 And sang out as never before
 And the words o' the song were a thousand years long
 And to learn them's a long thousand more

 My bonnie yew tree
 Tell me what CAN you see

 
The cache is no longer located inside the cathedral-like chamber created by the Yew Tree
 but the additional waypoint below will take you to the entrance.  I would urge you to have
look inside.  Wheelchairs/buggies would be able to get as far as the entrance.

The cache is now located a short walk from the Yew Tree.

It is located near bench taking in James' View - looking over the Bogs Holdings (often on maps as New Town) towards the Lammermuir Hills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paths are hard packed but uphill from either direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full loop is around 5 miles long - map http://www.wintonhouse.co.uk/pdf/walks.pdf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If completing the series i would suggest parking at Ormiston Station (see additional waypoint).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other caches in the series :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winton Loop - Winton House http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=96651c6f-db85-414a-9e1d-cb4be7921124&lt;br/&gt;Winton Loop - Roadside http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=8ec48533-2873-4855-871f-97c747909498&lt;br/&gt;Winton Loop - Macmerry Branch Line http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2c50ba2a-1ff1-43d0-953e-81adea571a6a&lt;br/&gt;Winton Loop - Kingfisher Bridge http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6997ea97-0896-4c4b-b980-bab799e02bcc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PA23FFM - Winton Loop Parking - Ormiston Station&lt;br/&gt;N 55° 55.042 W 002° 56.146&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Fa'side castle was built in the 14th century by the De Quincey
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name dates from 1189, when the monks of Newbattle Abbey
granted land to the De Quincy family to build the castle on the
site. The land was lost to Robert the Bruce after the De Quincy
family declared their loyalty to Edward I of England. (An
alternative view is that it was held by Alan la Zouche, 1st Baron
la Zouche of Ashby.) Bruce granted the castle to the Seton
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle was burned by the English before the Battle of Pinkie
Cleugh in 1547 (See my other cache Bloody Saturday GC2AGZ3) ,
suffocating or burning all those inside. It was rebuilt in the late
16th Century and sold in 1631 to an Edinbugh burgess and merchant
called Hamilton. By the 19th Century, it had fallen into ruin, and
was close to being demolished altogether in the 1970s. However, the
castle was saved and underwent restoration by Thomas Moodie Craig.
Nigel Tranter set up the Fa'side Restoration Society in 1970
through the St. Andrews Society of East Lothian, and introduced Tom
Craig to the castle in 1975. After investigation it was discovered
that the original name of the castle was Fawside Castle and this
remains its name today. The restoration work began in 1976 was
completed by 1982. The castle is now privately owned. The Fa'side
Estate includes a stud farm and a Bed &amp; Breakfast business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can be approached via the single track road that runs
from Tranent to Crookston or from Wallyford which has very good
public transport links (44 bus service or Edinburgh-N Berwick
trains).&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The coal seam at Tranent was referred to as the Great Seam as it
was over 7ft deep in sections. Fleets Colliery was the main pit in
the area. The first shaft was sunk in 1866 and operated for nearly
100 years. By the time of it's closure in 1959 there were two
shafts, one 73m and the other 154m deep. In 1948 during its peak
output the mine was producing 191,500 tons per annum and employed
816 men and women. The coal was initially transported to Cockenzie
Harbour by rail for export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleets was a very wet pit hence a
cornish beam engine (similar to that which can be seen at
Prestongrange Museum, Prestonpans) was installed in 1880.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

showing the clean entrance, statutory first-aid room and canteen on
the right, and the pit entrance, tower containing calorifier room,
plenum room and water storage tanks on the left. In the centre is
the clean locker room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is now occupied by a small
industrial estate and a controversial pharmaceutical testing
laboratory where animals are used as part of their research.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Massacre of Tranent occured on 29th August 1797.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After many long and bloody battle in Europe the British Army was
depleted and weak hence the Militia Act of 1797 was passed. As a
response to the governments insistence on conscripting local men
into the military the people of Tranent put together a proclamation
detailing their stance :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;1. We declare that we unanimously disapprove of the late Act of
Parliament for raising 6000 militiamen in Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. That we will assist each other in endeavouring to repeal the
said Act.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. That we are peaceably disposed; and should you, in endeavouring
to execute the said Act, urge us to adopt coercive measures, we
must look upon you to be the aggressors, and as responsible to the
nation for all the consequences that may follow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. Although we may be overpowered in effecting the said resolution,
and dragged from our parents, friends, and employment, to be made
soldiers of, you can infer from this what trust can be reposed in
us if ever we are called upon to disperse our fellow-countrymen, or
to oppose a foreign foe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When government troops were sent into the small town to 'resolve'
the matter they were met with protesting villagers. Despite
attempts of mediation the troops charged the crowd seemingly
attacking indiscriminant villagers whether involved in the protest
or not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; The townsfolk were led by Jackie Crookston, beating a
drum. She was one of the 20 villagers who were slaughtered that
day. Her statue in the Civic Square was erected in 1995. It was
shortly after removed and replaced with the boy running along side
after fears about its stability&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE BE WARY OF MUGGLES. THIS IS A VERY BUSY AREA OF TOWN&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I have rated the cache a 4 for difficulty for this reason&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please bring a scribe as i just found one on the desk that I
intended to place in the cache :o)&lt;/b&gt;

A part natural, part man-made feature - the site of ancient mine workings, there is evidence that mining in East Lothian can be traced back up to 2000 years. It is a steep sided glen running from Bridge Street down to Meadowmill. The Heugh would also form part of the route taken by the Tranent to Cockenzie Wagonway - the first railway in Scotland - transporting coal from Fleets Colliery to Cockenzie Harbour. These days the Heugh is still used regularly by walkers, joggers, dog walkers and horse riders. The route can still be walked almost uninterrupted all the way to Cockenzie Harbour. The route passes through Meadowmill, now occupied by Meadowmill Sports Centre, Bowling Club and playing fields which was once the Bankton Colliery, the large pyramid-styled hill is a bing/overburden that is now used as a view point of the Battle of Prestonpans battlefield and until recently had a dry ski-slope on the southern side. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1722 a wagonway was constructed by the York Buildings Company to transport coal from to Tranent to Cockenzie harbour for export.  The first incarnation was a very primitive affair with rails constructed of wood.&lt;br/&gt;The railway took a gentle downhill route from Tranent, via the Heugh, to Cockenzie Harbour.  Each wagon, carrying a load of coal would be pullled down the slope by gravity and controlled by a brakeman to the bottom of the hill where horses would be used to pull the empty wagons back up the hill, three at a time.&lt;br/&gt;Use of the railway was temporarily disrupted by the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745 when Johnny Cope's forces lined up again those of Bonnie Prince Charlie.&lt;br/&gt;In 1815 the wooden rails were replaced with iron, these new wagons could carry up to two tons of coal per trip.&lt;br/&gt;A lot of the route can still be followed down the Heugh and there are plans to reconstruct parts of the railway.  The area now occupied by Meadowmill Sports Centre, Bowling Club and playing fields was once a coal mine - the large pyramid-styled hill was a bing/overburden that is now used as a view point  of the Battle of Prestonpans battlefield - and until recently had a ski-slope on the southern side.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's a micro, sorry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cockenze has been the destination of the coal fields of Tranent and surrounding areas for almost as long as the coal has been mined. Originally, in the 13th century when the monks of Newbattle Abbey started up mining in Tranent a lot of the coal was transported down to Cockenzie and Prestonpans to supply the heat required to boil the water in the salt pans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 1722 the first railway in scotland was opened to improve the supply of coal to the harbour from where the coal would be shipped all over Britain to help power the industrial revolution. The harbour is used these days mainly for liesure craft but there is still an active boat builder located on the quayside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The harbour was rebuilt in the the 19th century, the design work being completed by one Robert Stevenson famed for his work in the development of steam locomotives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In recent times the coal fired power station has been the main beneficiary of the East Lothian coal fields. Work began on the construction in 1962 with the station being formally opened in May 1968. Coal was brought in from local pits such as Monktonhall, Bilston Glen and more recently Blindwells Open Cast Mine. These days all the coal is imported from abroad, the final leg of the journey being by train to the fuel station further in land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The large ring and balls near the cache are grinding equipment used to crush the coal prior to feeding the furnaces. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Once found please replace carefully.&lt;br/&gt;There is parking close by, charged at 60p for half an hour, free at weekends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During my time here in Aberdeen it always been a puzzle, why such a rich city, cosseted from the ups and downs of financial problems seen in the majority of Britain, why it lacks any quality public art and modern architecture, now this has to be the most important piece of architecture to be erected in the city, in the last 25 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Aberdeen university Library was designed by Danish architects Schmidt Hammer Lassen and built at the cost of £57 million pounds. It hasn't been all straightforward but for me I find it a very exciting edifice. If you do decide to search for this cache you may like to take a view inside which is just as exciting. </groundspeak:long_description>
