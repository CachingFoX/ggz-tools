It’s a steady walk all the way round which allows you to take up some of the breath taking views and gather some of that brilliant fresh air that we have around the Dorset Coast.

With over Thirty miles of footpath on the estate, there are plenty of Walks and directions to take. The West Dorset Team care for twenty three more places the National Trust owns... Hardy's birth place, the Cerne Giant, Lamberts Castle...Basically, there is something for everyone in West Dorset!

This Geocache can be combined with the caches below to make a circular route around the estate which should take you under 3 hours. This is a 35mm cannister which contains the log book only so please bring a pen.

This cache is in the old medieval village of Stanton Saint Gabriel’s, a village that is no longer there. You can however, still have a seat in the remainders of the old chapel and take a look at the old farmhouse that has been renovated into National Trust Holiday Cottages.Interesting fact: When they renovated the cottage, they couldnt work out why the outside was bigger than the inside...turns out, there was a secret gap in the wall to allow local smugglers to hide their stash!

This Geocache can be combined with the caches below to make a circular route around the estate which should take you under 3 hours. The cache is a small drinks container which contains a log book, pencil and small tradables. Please ensure the lid is on properly before replacing.

Parking in the National Trust car park, (N 50’ 44.019 W002’ 50.057) there is a small car parking fee for anyone not showing a members badge.

This cache is related to the old coach road that ran through the village from London through to Exeter. In its heyday, Saint Gabriel’s was a bustling little village with the road going straight through the middle of it, straight past the chapel. The population increased so much during one year that they had to make the chapel bigger! You can see this if you stand in the chapel and look at the back walls.

It’s a steady walk all the way round which allows you to take up some of the breath taking views and gather some of that brilliant fresh air that we have around the Dorset Coast. Parking in the National Trust car park, (N 50’ 44.019 W002’ 50.057) there is a small car parking fee for anyone not showing a members badge.

This area is locally known as Copse Mead. With two ponds, it has a brilliant species count, with dragon flies and frogs often seen during the spring and summer months. Roe deer have also been known to wander through this area, Together with the nesting woodpecker, this is a great place to stop and enjoy the wildlife
This Geocache can be combined with the caches below to make a circular route around the estate which should take you under 3 hours. The cache is a 35mm Film canister with another canister along side it to trade really small items. It contains the log book only so please bring a pen. There is a lot of tree cover so GPS coverage maybe dicey.

Welcome to Golden Cap (0X2RVDY)
Forever, for Everyone (0X2RHFX)
Who’s that walking over my bridge? (0X2T0H6)
There’s something fishy going on… (0XT0HC)
Ye old coach road (0X2T0HE)

Each of them will help you solve the puzzle to find this one.

Congratulations for if you are trying this Bonus, you will have already done the 6 other caches above in this series around this National Trust Estate .

The bonus cache is at N50 xx.xxx W 002 xx.xxx

To find the full coordinates, gather the letters you have found in the other caches, each with its number. The letters form an anagram of a special place on the estate and by substituting the numbers for letters you will have a 10 digit number.The first five digits will complete the Northings, and the last 5 will complete the westings. This is a large clip lid container so contains the usual log book and goodies. Tree cover can make GPS location dicey. Follow the natural route off the main path by the Oak to find the cache.Note: This an area full of Muggles so be careful!

We hope that you have enjoyed your walk on the Estate and Happy Caching  </groundspeak:long_description>

Came back on the 12.8.11 and found it. Really don't know how we missed it first time around! 




Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!! We collected the clues as we went around and solved the anagram. We ended up with 2 hyphens, one of which made sense! Mr B retraced to one cache to check the clues. As the hyphen was #8 it was crucial. We guessed at the number and tried all 10 digits from 0-9. One of them made sense but we couldn't find it :-(. As there have been no other logs, we don't know if it has been found. The first log date in the caches were before publication which states 2.6.11!</groundspeak:text>

Suggested parking is in the National Trust car park, (N 50’ 44.019 W002’ 50.057). There is a small parking fee for anyone not showing their NT members badge. 3 hours should be adequate to complete the circuit but , perhaps longer if you want to enjoy a picnic along the way.

he National Trust looks after and maintains the Golden Cap Estate. The estate has over 30 miles of footpaths and has over 250,000 visitors to the top of Golden Cap each year. It’s a steady walk of about 2 miles all the way round and includes one quite steep hill. It allows you to take in some of the breath taking views. Note: The difficulty for each of the caches is on an individual basis. The Terrrain takes into account the whole estate and all caches involved.

Golden Cap is the highest point on the South Coast, (618ft) and is famous for its Golden Colour, due to the band of sandstone running through the middle. The estate is made up of a number of long hills, covered in gorse and trees, with small fields of mainly permanent pasture and herb-rich meadows linked by ancient hedgerows.

The Rangers who look after the estate have worked out that there are over 200 miles of Hedgrows on the Estate. These hedges need to be managed and conserved. Every year, with the help of volunteers the team lay 1.5 miles of hedgerow each year. The hedges begin to grow back within a year and become a dense hedge within 3 years; perfect for small birds and the illusive dormouse!

The Stonebarrow shop and information centre is housed within an Old radar station, used during the Second Worls War and the cold War to scan the coastline for enemy aircraft.

This Geocache can be combined with the caches below to make a route along the top of the hill which should take you about two hours.Note: The difficulty for each of the caches is on an individual basis. The terrain takes into account the whole estate and all caches involved. Bring a picnic if you want to make a day of it!

The Grassland on Stonebarrow Hill is home to many butterflies such as the Common Blue and the small pearl-borded fritillary.

In the winter of 2010, The Rangers worked alongside Natural England to cut back some of the Gorse that had been growing up over the years on the Hill. Doing this work has encouraged the grass to grow back as well as the Dog Violets which is the foodplant for the Small pearl-borded fritillary. In the next few years we hope to improve numbers of this declining butterfly.

Park in the Eyebridge Car Park coordinates: N50 48.021  W2 00.419. From the car park walk towards the river then follow the path through the gate to find your prize. 

This walk can flood in the winter so either bring wellies or keep as a summer cache. 

Happy Hunting.    </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache was a nice easy find in its bold hiding place!  We took nothing and left a couple of mini glowsticks.  As Dizzypair says, this is a traditional cache as it stands, not a multi.

Thanks for a great cache.

Decided to do this as a cache and dash as the rain was almost continuous this afternoon.

I note that this cache is listed as a multi but is a traditional which means the cache is at the listed coordinates.

Thank you for your hospitality and we look forward to finding the rest of your caches.</groundspeak:text>

Parking at White Mill Car Park coordinates: N50 48.352  W2 03.644. As you come out the car park turn right and follow your nose in a Westerly direction along the Stour Valley Way. 

The Stour Valley Way is a designated footpath that follows almost all of the River Stours 64 miles of scenic flow. It cuts a blue ribbon through Wiltshire then onto Dorset and Christchurch, Mudeford, Bournemouth and Wimborne.   

Area is liable to flooding in winter so please bring wellies.  

Happy Hunting!

The cache was a nice easy find but the coordinates took us to the hedge 50ft feet short of the cache site.  We took a reading of N 50° 48.233  W002° 04.564.  It was great to find another good sized box.  We took nothing and left a glowstick.

Thanks for another great cache.  Looking forward to the next!

Park in the White Mill Car Park coordinates are: N50 48.352  W2 03.644. Put your walking boots on and make sure you have plenty of water. Turn out of the car park heading left passed White Mill (pop in if you haven't visited before) and head to Point A. The coordinates are N50 48.092  W2 03.486 here you will need to search for and find your next coordinate stage, leading to further way points. 

We believe this walk should take you around 1.5 - 2 hours. It includes a total of eight way points including the car park.

Happy Hunting.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a stroke of luck stumbling on to this website and this new set of caches so close to home!  This is what geocaching used to be like in the old days when it was all about taking you on a lovely walk with a nice big box at the end.  We loved the way the clues were in plain sight to start with and got progressively harder to find, and the nicely presented 4.6 litre box was a real treat.  We took nothing and left a glowstick.

Thanks for a great multi and for reminding us what it was like when we started caching ten years ago!

Park in the Pamphill Green Car Park the coordinates are: N50 48.370  W2 00.945.   

Turn out of the car park heading left in a Northerly direction following the path to Point A. The coordinates are N50 48.382  W2 01.143, here you will need to search for and find your next coordinate leading to further stages, keep going untill you find the cache and make for home. 

Total number of way points on this route including car park is 5. This walk should take around 1h - 1.5 hrs. 


Happy Hunting.    </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We combined this one with Eyebridge Idyll for a lovely circular walk via Cowgrove and Eyebridge on a sunny autumn afternoon.  The Kingston Lacy kitchen garden en route was interesting, and we enjoyed watching the cute Kunekune piglets.

The clues were great fun to find, and we loved the way the first was hidden in plain sight, probably easier to spot at this time of year than in the summer!  The cache (a lovely big 4.6 litre box) had been found by accident by children on 8 October but everything seemed as it should be.  We took the NT voucher (thank you very much!) and left a couple of glowsticks.

Thanks for a great multi, just the sort we like.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Dear Happy Cachers, 

Please park in St.Bartholomew's Church Car Park. The coordinates for this car park are: N50 48.874  W2 05.446. Follow the Stour Valley Way Walk in a South Westerly direction towards your geo cache way point.   

The Stour Valley Way is a designated footpath that follows almost all of the River Stours 64 miles of scenic flow. It cuts a blue ribbon through Wiltshire then onto Dorset and Christchurch, Mudeford, Bournemouth and Wimborne.   

The River Stour can flood in winter so either bring wellies or keep this as a summer cache only.  

Happy hunting!  </groundspeak:long_description>

It had been found once before a few days ago.  I collected Sammy the working man's sheep and left octopussy.  Signed the lovely new logbook.  A lovely cache site. TFTC
25 Sep 2011
On my evening walk and checked on Jack's Stash.  Unfortunately the cache box has been broken so is in need of repair/replacement.</groundspeak:text>

The railway line which also runs the length of the&lt;br/&gt;cylepath is useful for securing your bike – if you have not been&lt;br/&gt;here before don’t’ worry, it’s disused! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the cache is hidden in an avenue of woodland satellite&lt;br/&gt;reception isn't great.&lt;br/&gt;However, as the woodland is very narrow you can use the public&lt;br/&gt;footpath at the edge of the field to the left when going uphill and&lt;br/&gt;try a combination of dead reckoning and your cache hunting skills&lt;br/&gt;to locate it – there would be no fun without a challenge would&lt;br/&gt;there?! Please be aware that there are nettles in this area so you&lt;br/&gt;might want to wear long trousers or take a stick to get to/from&lt;br/&gt;this path – there are no nettles or similar nasties at the cache&lt;br/&gt;site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache container and contents were originally placed here by&lt;br/&gt;Unruely who decided not to activate it thinking the location was&lt;br/&gt;not very good. Having returned to the States this generous cacher&lt;br/&gt;offered it to me when I helped clear one of his other caches. On&lt;br/&gt;retrieving the cache I was impressed by its challenge, proximity to&lt;br/&gt;the Colliers Way and the views from the footpath beside the cache&lt;br/&gt;so have decided to leave it there – if you think it’s good credit&lt;br/&gt;Unruely, if you don’t like it blame me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst the cache is to the East of the Colliers Way you need to&lt;br/&gt;leave the cycleway to the West and go through the access tunnel&lt;br/&gt;under the line to access it - see additional waypoints below. Leave&lt;br/&gt;the cycletrack at the steps beside the small sewage works (hold&lt;br/&gt;your nose!) or via the Kilmesdon cycle/wheelchair access ramp which&lt;br/&gt;is about 100 yards further Southwest. If you are caching and&lt;br/&gt;dashing there is parking for one car by this tunnel but you are&lt;br/&gt;advised to park in the village car park and walk here. Go through&lt;br/&gt;the tunnel and the cache is up the hill near this track. However,&lt;br/&gt;as suggested above, once through the tunnel you may find it best to&lt;br/&gt;follow the public footpath at the edge of the field to your left&lt;br/&gt;until you are near the cache – happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the &lt;b&gt;Colliers Way&lt;/b&gt; and a map see this website - http://www.colliersway.co.uk/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access tunnel - N 51° 16.366 W 002° 26.133&lt;br/&gt;Kilmersdon Village Car Park- N 51° 16.201 W 002° 26.271&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Very muddy and the path within the wood resembles a stream at the moment

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off Yer Trolley!&lt;/strong&gt; caches are
intended to provide fairly easy drive-by caches together with the
opportunity to CITO in their recycling area and nip in to do the
shopping at the same time or even escape the shopping for &lt;em&gt;&quot;The
need to cache&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is within the grounds of a well known national
supermarket chain with no history or special features observed,
picked for (1) sheer annoyance factor, in the midst of Muggles and
therefore (slightly) technically difficult and (2) A good
opportunity for a CITO.&lt;br/&gt;

As well as being accessible on foot and by bicycle this cache has been designed to be wheelchair friendly, but be warned - the immediate path can get quite muddy in winter. There are great views of the Mendip Hills and Cheddar Gorge from around this site and there is a good circular walk around the Cheddar Reservoir just a few yards away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strawberry Line is part of the National Cycle Network.Download a pdf route leaflet (1114KB) here - http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/leaflets/Strawberry%20Line%20leaflet.pdf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GPSr is not essential to find this cache so that those new to this game who do not yet own one can use the map on the top right of this page (change the view to Bird's eye and zoom in), Google Earth (http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/earth/download/ge/) or similar satellite imaging programme to see the area where the cache might be hidden then go out and search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheelchair/mobility scooter cachers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hide has been set with wheelchair users in mind. The access from Holwell Lane or from either end of the Strawberry Line is level with no steps but off the Strawberry Line it is a more bumpy and often muddy farm track. Those with limited mobility may need a grab stick to retreive the box. The Handicache rating (http://www.handicaching.com/) for this cache is &lt;strong&gt;H22112 -&lt;/strong&gt; Click the log below to see details. Incidentally, the Strawberry Line has excellent mobility access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking - N 51° 16.667 W 002° 47.691&lt;br/&gt;Parking for wheelchair users only - N 51° 16.663 W 002° 47.332&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Not many caches out there yet! This doesn't surprise me as I struggle to see the point of two separate geocaching sites, however this one gave me an excuse for a nice walk around the reservoir. An easy find as the cache was quite exposed, so I hid it a bit better afterwards. Thanks for this one Robin.</groundspeak:text>

the Conker trees lining the path - so a great place to bring the
children to collect conkers.&lt;br/&gt;
The path used to be metalled and was called Gaston Avenue. It ran
between the Bristol road (now the A37) by Clutton Brewery and
Church Farm. It was illuminated by Gas lamps - evidence of which
can still be seen today.&lt;/p&gt;

Colliery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greyfield Colliery started life in 1833 and closed some 78 years
later in 1911. Closure was due to the Earl Of Warwick refusing to
pay heavy royalties on coal mined under neighbouring estates, and
put 300 men out of work. The pit flooded in 1909 killing only
horses kept underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footpath runs between Clutton hill and Maynard Terrace. The
path can be overgrown during the summer, but dies back in the
winter for easier access. It maybe easier to access from Maynard
Terrace end of the footpath during summer. The public footpath is a
right of way between two gardens in Maynard Terrace and up
decorative gravelled steps. The path is sign posted, but the photos
below make finding the start of the path a little easier and more
discrete.&lt;/p&gt;

Mineral Railway to Frome, forming a 24 mile through route. The line

&lt;p&gt;The building a short walk backtowards Clutton was once an Inn
called the Cross Keys and described as a&quot;Snug Old Fashioned Inn and
Small Holding with Beer and Tobacco Licence&quot; when sold by the Earl
of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that is the former Burchills Colliery, belonging to the
Earl of Warwick's estate. The mine operated an incline and worked
coal between 1911 and 1921. Equipment had been transferred from
Greyfield Colliery upon its closure in 1911. The site is now a
housing estate with the mine entrance approximately under the
children play park.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Some small vestiges of Norman Twerton survive within the parish
church of St Michael and All Angels. The font is dated to the time
of Reginald, Bishop of Bath (1174-91), and the Norman doorway, now
moved to the south side, would have been used by inhabitants of
Twerton to enter the church the best part of a thousand years ago.
William Malrward gave the church to the nunnery at Kington St
Michael near Chippeham in 1180, and the church is believed to have
been dedicated to St Michael in 1191 by the Abbot of Glastonbury.
St Michael is the archangel in the Bible who fights against the
Devil and defeats him. A past tradition has been the annual Twerton
Revel on St Michael's Day. Today the association of Twerton with St
Michael is recalled by the modern name of St Michael's Road at
Whiteway, now within the parish of Southdown. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Carrs Woodland is a beautiful area of broadleaved woodland,
limestone pasture and a brook, situated on the edge of Twerton,
Bath. It follows the valley of the small Newton Brook, extending
from the top of the hill, with extensive views across the
countryside to the west of Bath, down steeply wooded and grassy
slopes to the brook, curving round the hill to the north and south
along the valley. Its character is shaped by a sense of the
countryside, the past, natural wildness, peace and tranquillity.
Its magnificent beech trees are one of the most important landmarks
on the western edge of Bath and it has views stretching out across
open fields and the railway. It is rich in wildlife and signs of
its fascinating history. It is owned and managed by BAth &amp;
North East Somerset Council and was designated a Local Nature
Reserve in 2006. Placed with the assistance and permision of Lucy
Corner of Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This geocache, which is also listed on Opencaching.org.UK (http://www.opencaching.org.uk/) is near one of the viewpoints on the northern flank of Cadbury Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hill is open access and therefore open to the public. Although not high (81 mtr at the summit) Cadbury Hill commands great views over the surrounding northerly fringe of the Somerset levels. On a clear day you can see to the mountains of Wales, the Aberthaw power station chimney (26 miles), and Exmoor (45 miles) as well as more locally across the village of Yatton and the surrounding levels to Clevedon and Weston. About 200 mts to the south west the main part of the hill hosts a hillfort with signs of occupancy going back to the Neolitic - this is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument (http://ycccart.co.uk/CadburyHill.aspx/) and certainly worth a visit whilst you are here. Please note that this cache is hidden outside the scheduled monument area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended route is to park at the recommended Parking (see below) and approach from the North West. You might like to follow the waypoints for the nearby Cadbury Hill multi geocache (see below) which starts at the same place then you can pick up this one, plus the other 2 caches on Cadbury Hill (see below), on your way round - 4 for the price of one! Keep your eye out for the recently restored dewpond (see additional waypoints) and the lost mineshaft – don't worry, it has a concrete cap!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Geocaches on this hill:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cadbury Hill (multi) - http://coord.info/GCWA76&lt;br/&gt;Golden Desert Eagle - http://coord.info/GC2FGTZ&lt;br/&gt;Flaming Kestrels - http://coord.info/GC2FGV4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt; that whilst you can approach this cache from the South East via Blind Lane there is no public parking on this lane and you are asked not to drive or park in this lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheelchair/mobility scooter&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cachers&lt;/strong&gt; can access this cache by either of 2 options:&lt;br/&gt;1) Easy route - ignore the final paragraph above and park carefully at N51° 22.922 W002° 48.023 keeping tight to the wall ensuring that you do not obstruct the kissing gate, house access or public bridleway.&lt;br/&gt;2) Intrepid route - only suitable for the more adventurous  'all terrain' wheelchair geocacher. Park at the normal Parking coordinates and follow the route. This involves involves a relatively steep 300 mtr hill climb on grass/track and you'll need to skirt around the anti-motorcycle boulders at the bottom - just continue a few meters South East along the bridleway and pick up a second side path. Certainly a challenge but there are no steps or other impassable barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handicache rating (http://www.handicaching.com) based on option 1) is = &lt;strong&gt;H14122&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB: Unfortunately the 3 nearby caches are not wheelchair/scooter accessible as kissing gates bar the way &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Waypoints:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking - N 51° 23.017 W0 02° 48.383&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dewpond - N 51° 22.933 W 002° 48.272&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Kenn Hangings 8th September 1830 were the last hangings to take place where the crime was committed in the united kingdom.
 John Rowley 30yrs, Richard Clarke 19yrs, William Wall 35yrs were all sentanced to death for setting fire to three wheat mows destroying around 50 bushels of wheat.
 
At the time it seems that Kenn was the scene of a large number of crimes, not committed by the starving, but those in search of an easier life. Walls Cider farm at the bottem of Duck Lane was frequented by the people commiting the crimes.
 
The hanging field is the field directly behind where the cache is hidden.

&lt;p&gt;The Bristol and North Somerset Railway was a railway line in the
West of England that connected Bristol with towns in the Somerset
coalfield. The line ran almost due south from Bristol and was 16
miles long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal traffic on the railway was coal from the Somerset
coalfield, though the villages nearer Bristol generated some
commuter traffic. Passenger services were never frequent: in 1910,
there were eight trains a day at most (on Thursdays and Saturdays)
and not all of those ran through to or from Frome.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Small container, with a few small trades. On street parking is nearby and plentiful. The cache is accessible from a tarmac surface with a gentle incline. The cache is NOT on Church grounds.

In 1087 at the time of the Domesday Book, &quot;Brisilton&quot; was part of the Manor of Cainesham (Keynsham) and, in the same year, became a manor in its own right. The settlement grew from a collection of wattle and daub huts around Brislington Brook in the area still referred to today by locals as &quot;The Village&quot;.

The cache is placed close to the Parish Church of St.Luke the Evangelist. It was built in 15th century. A famous tomb in the churchyard dated 1542, is inscribed “Thomas NEWMAN aged 153”. I think a local prankster carved an extra digit! Another famously long-lived person arrived in 1556, the vicar, Richard PHILPOT. He made the first entry in the parish register on 2nd September 1566, the baptism of John, son of John MACY. The registers have been kept continuously ever since apart from a hiatus during the interregnum. PHILPOT was relieved by Oliver CHIVERS in 1631, when by my reckoning he would have been 97.

Brislington's origins of course go back much further. The first documented evidence comes from the remains of the Romano British villa, dating from 270 - 300 CE, which were discovered when Winchester Road was being built in 1899. Prehistoric flint tools dating from the Neolithic age have also been discovered in several locations, showing that Brislington was inhabited more than 4,000 years ago.

Nearby, on the junction of Glenarm Road and the A4 Bath Road (top of Brislington Hill) the once home of Nora Fry can be found.
Norah Fry (1871-1960) was born and educated in Bristol. She was a member of a famous Bristol Quaker family who made chocolate and cocoa at the famous JS Fry and Sons chocolate factory.

Norah Fry was an advocate for better services for people with learning disabilities. She was very concerned about the lack of proper schools for disabled children and the shortage of housing for people with learning disabilities. For over fifty years she was a member of the council of Bristol University and had a very close relationship with university staff. Norah Fry gave the university some money to set up the Department of Mental Health. The Nora Fry Research Centre continues this work as part of the University today.

&lt;p&gt;The Bristol and North Somerset Railway was a railway line in the
West of England that connected Bristol with towns in the Somerset
coalfield. The line ran almost due south from Bristol and was 16
miles long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal traffic on the railway was coal from the Somerset
coalfield, though the villages nearer Bristol generated some
commuter traffic. Passenger services were never frequent: in 1910,
there were eight trains a day at most (on Thursdays and Saturdays)
and not all of those ran through to or from Frome.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The series of geocaches at National Trust Tyntesfield are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful estate.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located on public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

The geocaches at National Trust Tyntesfield are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful estate.

Focusing on wildlife and habitats, the geocaches are all located on public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information on the biodiversity of each location and a family-friendly activity to do. All geocaches are less than 5m from the public footpaths. Some may be camouflaged with twigs and leaves, so please replace this cover after you have finished with the geocache.

*Please note that the Activity Cards, Information Cards and binoculars belong to this Geocache and should not be removed. There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys, usb cables) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs). As the geocaches are quite large (lunch box size) they are suitable for larger travel bugs*

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1. The public footpaths on the estate can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather. Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2. As with any woodland area, there are lots of roots and other trip hazards about – so watch where you put your feet. Please avoid woodland areas in high winds.
3. Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths. There are also some sections of barbed wire along the fence line.
4. Please keep an eye out for stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the woodland plants (e.g. bluebells in spring).
5. Some of the footpaths pass through fields, which at some times of year have livestock in them (sheep / young cows). Please close all gates behind you!
6. Parking is only available within the Tyntesfield estate when we are open to the public, which is everyday except Christmas Day. Some local parking is available (e.g. New Battleaxes Pub, Wraxall and on Wraxall Hill) but may be limited, especially on weekends.

Access Information: The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate slopes and several stiles along the route.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 3 new caches added to the series of geocaches at National Trust Tyntesfield in 2009 are a way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful estate. Focusing a little more on built structures, these geocaches are all located on public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.

The geocaches at National Trust Tyntesfield are a new way for people to explore and engage with this beautiful estate.
Focusing on built structures, the geocaches are all located on public rights of way and so are accessible year round without charge.
Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as information on the each location and a family-friendly activity to do. All geocaches are less than 5m from the public footpaths. Some may be camouflaged with twigs, leaves or small stones, so please replace this cover after you have finished with the geocache.
*Please note that the Activity Cards and Information Cards belong to this Geocache and should not be removed. There may be other items that are left by fellow geocachers to be exchanged (e.g. small toys, usb cables) or moved on (geocache coins / travel bugs). As the geocaches are quite large (lunch box size) they are suitable for larger travel bugs*
Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1. The public footpaths on the estate can be uneven, muddy and slippery in wet weather. Wellies or walking boots are recommended!
2. As with any woodland area, there are lots of roots and other trip hazards about – so watch where you put your feet. Please avoid woodland areas in high winds.
3. Keep an eye on young children as there are slopes and drop-offs close to the footpaths. There are also some sections of barbed wire along the fence line.
4. Please keep an eye out for stinging nettles, brambles and holly (for your own comfort!) and tread carefully to avoid trampling the woodland plants (e.g. bluebells in spring).
5. Some geocaches are located close to estate boundary walls, which are in a poor state of repair. Please note that no geocaches are hidden in the walls themselves and please do not try and climb on the walls as they may collapse. 6. Some of the footpaths pass through fields, which at some times of year have livestock in them (sheep / young cows). Please close all gates behind you!
7. Parking is only available within the Tyntesfield estate when we are open to the public - everyday apart from Christmas Day. Some local parking is available (e.g. New Battleaxes Pub, Wraxall or on Wraxall Hill) but may be limited, especially on weekends.
Access Information: The public footpaths are very uneven in places and may be slippery. There are also some moderate slopes and several stiles along the route.</groundspeak:long_description>

The paths are suitable for most, although it is not that pushchair friendly in places. For the most part, tree cover should not be too bad. There is no set route for most of the game, it is a matter of going and seeing what you can find.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is near the village of Walton-in-Gordano with some great views of the Severn Estuary and the Gordano Valley. Park on the coast road behind Clevedon Golf Course (take care with children as cars drive quickly along this section of narrow road). A short walk down the road will lead to the footpath up into the woods on the left. Path is steep and can be slippery in the rain. This should be a good cache for the kiddies (Trinkets etc inside for the kids to swap). Afterwards, why not pop down the road to the village shop for some refreshment? (Unfortunately closed on Sundays) </groundspeak:long_description>

(cos there aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public
transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations. SideTracked started at Evesham
station on August 10th 2007, placed by schnarff &amp; bikermel76.

It took a while to get started, but is now spreading across the
country! It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in
the same way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and
remember that in this day and age, public transport is under
greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should
be quick and easy grabs,
PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it could
cause alarm!!! (Particularly, please ensure that you aware of the
new rules of 04/09/08 before hiding your Cache!) 

Bristol parkway station. Well what can you say about it? I know what I'd like to
say about it but I won't, this being a family site. 

Bristol Parkway is apparently the 212 most used station in the UK, which isn't bad
for what in effect a glorified bus shelter. It was build in the
1970s to serve as a way of speeding up the London to Wales route,
as the north side of the city is on a more direct line to the
Severn Tunnel. Getting to Parkway: Apart from the trains which stop
here; Parkway is served by buses from Bristol town centre and
outlying suburbs, and is tangentially connected to the ring-road
cycle track. If you're coming by car, then the best place to park
is in the station short-stay drop off car park (free for 20
minutes). 

The 35mm canister (magnetic jobbie) is located close to
both the short-stay car-park and an ad-hoc public cut through. As
per all stations, the density of muggles varies so you will need to
pick your time. Notes: I've upped the difficulty to 2. Kudos to
Captain Gore-Tex for the FTF.

Agree with Captain Gortex that it might be worth increasing the difficultly a little.

Some farm buildings remain in use today as offices for enterprising companies. The name is remembered through the local road names. The farm's duck pond and small green are now a picturesque escape for many workers looking for somewhere to sit out and eat their lunch.

Good lunch time cache and dash

On street parking nearby, although fairly busy during week days.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Layby along a great biking road between Chepstow and Usk. Cache &amp; Dash - Accessible by car or motorcycle, no stiles to climb.

This is the first ever cache placed by Xan173 and Princessbuttercp of Bristol. We chose this location as it is on a great motorcycling road where one of our friends had a minor accident, hence the reference to Cuffy's corner. The cache can be driven to and parking for one car should be available. Please watch out for motorcycles when arriving at or leaving this cache, especially at weekends.

The cache is a classic tupperware box in a camo bag. The cache contents at start are: A US $1 bill, a French 5 centimes coin, a badge, an Aeroplane clip, a 1 US cent coin, a mountain bike tool / keychain, an &quot;I love Mum&quot; heart shaped tattoo sticking plaster, a mini highlighter pen, an ink stamp, and true to our Bristolian roots a &quot;Vicky Pollard&quot; top trumps playing card.

The Ebenezer steps go from Railway Street in low town up to West Castle Street in high town. They are one of seven main stairways that led from the low town to the high town. In total there are 34 steps on this flight making them the shortest fight out of the main flights. 677 in total in all seven flights.

This cache requires some fitness but the steps of Bridgnorth are amazing fun!

Nice easy little nano cache in beautiful Bridgnorth. This cache is located on the Bridgnorth quayside and was chosen for it’s amazing views across the river and bridge. There are no access issues and the ground is level but this area can flood if the waters are very high. Please obey the warning signs.

Bridgnorth’s quayside had three dockyards as well as numerous warehouses, stables, and other commercial buildings. Many of the bargemen drank and lived in the houses along Cartway and Underhill Street.

Safe passage between Bristol and Montgomeryshire (155 miles) depended on the water level. Upstream came spices, groceries, wine, and rum. Downstream went coal, dairy produce, pottery, wood, leather, and iron goods. The trade peaked in the mid 18th century; when there were 376 vessels operating between Welshpool and Gloucester, including 75 from Bridgnorth. River trade declined with the opening of the original Severn Valley Railway in 1862.

There was a bridge here as early as the 10th century. The later stone bridge once had several houses on it including a church, and a gatehouse that had a portcullis and also served as a gaol. Shortly before Thomas Telford widened the bridge in 1822-23 these buildings were removed.

This cache is published on the Geocaching website also: GC30HKP.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are other caches nearby so you can do those too. There is a small container for swaps, trackables etc. I've placed two trackables in the cache to start with, please make sure you put swaps, trackables etc in this smaller tub. Take a pen/pencil with you to sign the logbook.

Please Note:
You are welcome to put books in this cache that haven't been registered with bookcrossing.com - I'll pick them up and register them on your behalf. Please note in your log entries which book you've left so I know :)

I was in early this morning so I decided I would go and find this one while it was still quiet. A quick walk down into the woods and the cache was quickly found.

Luckily I had a pencil with me as there isn't one in the cache.

Looks like I need to change my plans for the [url=http://coord.info/GC2C175]To Cache a Kippa[/url] event as I was going to place a cache very close to here.

Arrived in my inbox just before 5pm and as it was Keele Woods, there really was no question, I was off!!   Was a little disappointed to find the cache in full view from the field.  I tried to camoflauge it a bit more with sticks, but its not easy.
Left a couple of England world cup medals and took the dragonfly tb.

Parking is readily available at The Apedale visitor centre until dusk.
The cache is a screw top container covered in tape and contains the usual log and a couple of pens plus a few swappable knick knacks.
This geocache is in the area where the Apedale canal originated! It is a couple of metres off the footpath near to large boulders of slag spoil.

Apedale canal was built in 1776, after Sir Nigel Gresley (the then owner of the Apedale Estate) and his son Nigel Bowyer-Gresley obtained permission to build it through an Act of Parliament in 1775. Unlike many Canals this was privately owned.
It ran from Sladderhilll colliery in Apedale, past the Iron works, across what is now the Holditch Industrial Estate, and then onto Newcastle. The Newcastle end of the canal terminated at Liverpool Road, North of Newcastle.
The coming of rail spelt the end for the Apedale Canal which closed to traffic in the 1850. Very little remains other than a few traces in Apedale, notably an embankment which carried the canal across the stream at the bottom of Apedale Valley can still be seen.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Elev 470ft. Probably due to tree cover GPS accuracy at time of waymarking plus/minus 23ft.
The cache location is an easy woodland ramble.
The cache is on a track a few meters off the footpath which borders the Chesterton community angling clubs Burley Pool which is Private property and need not be trespassed upon.
The cache is not a regular container and blends in well with it's location. Close inspection will be required!

Ample parking is available at The Apedale visitor centre until dusk or off Apedale road.
The most preferable approach to this cache would be from the visitor centre or Apedale road.
The cache is situated along a track just off the footpath in the woodland and is not wheelchair accessible!
Sensible footwear is recommended as the area can be muddy in wet weather!
The area may be very busy in summer time so I suggest stealth is used as a priority!
If you find the cache please leave it exactly as you found it as I wish it to remain at least 2 or 3 seasons until requiring maintenance.
There is a small pencil with a waterproof paper logbook.
In summer when the tree canopy thickens GPS accuracy may be quite poor, to this end if requested I shall add a specific photographic spoiler.

Would finders please not photograph the cache or it's location as I want the experience for others to be intact. Photograph the log book or the near vicinity by all means!</groundspeak:long_description>

This was our second ever Opencaching.com cache. We enjoyed the stroll back down through the gardens and then being led to this lovely quiet spot. While the boys played with the small hoops, we set about searching for the cache. The cache title seemed to indicate where to look, but after exhausting all the obvious options we widened our search. Al then went chasing after a hoop that James had thrown and hey presto! there was the cache container. Just shows how sometimes you can't find something unless you're not looking for it. Thanks for the cache.

It was great to see some familiar faces and at the same time be able to walk around and actually find all the caches for ourselves rather than in the hands of the previous finders! 
This was our first ever Opencaching.com cache, as until now we've only seen listings that are duplicates of ones that had already been published on Geocaching.com so it was hard to see the point of them. Not a political or value judgement point, just a practical one.
But these ones are only listed here... so here we are now! We had a lovely stroll through the gardens, and made much harder work of finding this one than we should have done. Quite a few things matching the hint, and the GPSs weren't settling that well with the tree cover. But finally, after exhausting all the nearby options, we were just about to give up and move on when another cacher spotted it. Well done you! We all signed the log, and then wondered why we'd not spotted it sooner. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the eighth of the caches that we found while attending the Biddulph Grange event today with jamange. It was great to see some familiar faces and at the same time be able to walk around and actually find all the caches for ourselves rather than in the hands of the previous finders! 
This was our third Opencaching.com cache, and the last of those placed inside the gardens. We did this one while completing the stages for the new multicache listed on Geocaching.com and it certainly proved to be conveniently close by for one of them. The boys made an instant find as soon as we told them that we were now close to ground zero. Another lovely spot for a cache, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stroll back and forth around the beautiful gardens. Thanks for the cache.

About SideTracked
We have Motorway Mayhem. We have A-Road Anarchy
(cos there aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public
transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations. SideTracked started at Evesham
station on August 10th 2007, placed by schnarff &amp; bikermel76.

It took a while to get started, but is now spreading across the
country! It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in
the same way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and
remember that in this day and age, public transport is under
greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should
be quick and easy grabs,
PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it could
cause alarm!!! (Particularly, please ensure that you aware of the
new rules of 04/09/08 before hiding your Cache!)

the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of
Cheshire, England. According to the 2001 census, the civil parish
and village has a population of 220. The nearest town is Bollington

14th Century. Take a walk around the church yard, there's a lot of
interesting things to see here, with great views through the
tress.&lt;br/&gt;

There is a slightly closer parking space, which should be obvious
once you know the location, however if you can - walk it. There's
some great views along the way. Original cache contents: Log book,
pencils and a number of swaps. Hope you enjoy the cache - please
post some photos of your adventures! Final coords showed as being
correct to 5 meters, due to tree cover. I tried them a number of

About SideTracked 
We have Motorway Mayhem. We have A-Road Anarchy
(cos there aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public
transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations. SideTracked started at Evesham
station on August 10th 2007, placed by schnarff &amp; bikermel76.

It took a while to get started, but is now spreading across the
country! It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in
the same way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and
remember that in this day and age, public transport is under
greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should
be quick and easy grabs,
PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it could
cause alarm!!! (Particularly, please ensure that you aware of the
new rules of 04/09/08 before hiding your Cache!)

Adlington Railway Station was manned for many years but is now unstaffed. The station building is now privately owned and there is no longer a ticket machine, so passengers must purchase their ticket on the train.
According to Network Rail's route utilisation strategy Adlington is in the top 50 least used station with on average 0.9 person using each train, up by 0.4 on the previous year. This means that approximately 42 people use the station a day on weekdays with 37 on a Saturday and 6 on a Sunday. Despite this, almost every Northern Rail service calls at the station.

Opened by the London and North Western Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. 

Service

From 14th December 2008 trains operate on an hourly pattern, terminating at Stoke on Trent (southbound) or Manchester Piccadilly (northbound). Some early morning/late night services originate/terminate at Macclesfield.
Trains towards Stoke on Trent generally depart Adlington at xx11 (Monday to Saturday) with an additional evening peak service at 17.41 (Monday to Friday only). The last two services in an evening terminate at Macclesfield.
Trains towards Manchester Piccadilly depart Adlington at xx27 Mondays to Saturdays, however services before 09.00 are significantly different (Monday to Friday) with departures at 06.29, 07.00, 07.25, 07.47 and 08.26.
Northbound services towards Manchester Piccadilly generally call at Heaton Chapel and Levenshulme whereas Southbound services do not.
There are three afternoon/evening services in each direction on Sundays.

changed to small cache 12/06/09
Replaced &amp; changed location - 23/06/2010

REPLACE CAREFULLY, MAKE SURE IT IS WELL HIDDEN!

The Cache is NEXT to the brook running through the Coppice, WALKING BOOTS OR WELLIES RECOMMENDED

After crossing the bridge, go into the water and follow the co-ords until you reach the cache. BE CAREFUL WHILE WALKING THROUGH THE WATER, ESPECIALLY AFTER RAIN.

The area can get VERY muddy.

Scouting began in 1907 when Robert Baden-Powell, Lieutenant General in the British Army, held the first Scouting encampment at Brownsea Island in England. Baden-Powell wrote the principles of Scouting in Scouting for Boys (London, 1908), based on his earlier military books, with influence and support of Frederick Russell Burnham (Chief of Scouts in British Africa), Seton of the Woodcraft Indians, Smith of the Boys' Brigade, and his publisher Pearson. During the first half of the 20th century, the movement grew to encompass three major age groups each for boys (Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Rover Scout) and, in 1910, a new organization, Girl Guides, was created for girls (Brownie Guide, Girl Guide and Girl Scout, Ranger Guide).

In 1871 Poynton separated from Prestbury and became a Parish in its own right. The Church, being built in the middle of the 19th Century reflects the architectural tastes of that period - which was to create a building in 13th Century Gothic style

About SideTracked 

We have Motorway Mayhem. We have A-Road Anarchy (cos there aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations. 

It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in the same way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and remember that in this day and age, public transport is under greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should be quick and easy grabs, PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it could cause alarm!!!

For more information on SideTracked Caches, please visit SideTracked

The lake is used for fishing, and permits can be bought from the angling store in hazel grove. The main field can be used any time, to go for walks or anything else you feel like. it is also used to hold 'Poynton Bonfire' and 'Poynton Show' which are ran by the round table.

This cache is a 35mm Film Cannister with a log book and pencil :) The co-ordinates might be a bit off due to the fact i couldnt get much signal around here
please put it back as it was found
Thank you

&lt;p&gt;We have Motorway Mayhem. We have A-Road Anarchy (cos there
aren’t many Motorways in Wales!). But what about public
transport users? SideTracked Caches are intended to provide quick
Cache-and-dashes at Train Stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped this idea will spread across the country in the same
way as the MMs….but if hiding one PLEASE BE SENSIBLE and
remember that in this day and age, public transport is under
greater scrutiny than ever before, so, although these caches should
be quick and easy grabs, PLEASE don’t place a Cache where it
could cause alarm!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on SideTracked Caches, please visit
SideTracked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Strines&lt;/b&gt;


Strines is a village in Greater Manchester, located in the valley
of the River Goyt midway between Marple and New Mills and about six
miles southeast of Stockport. The village falls mainly within
Marple parish and Stockport metropolitan borough, though a small
part (including the railway station) falls within the boundaries of
New Mills and thus in the Borough of High Peak, Derbyshire.
Immediately surrounding Strines are the villages of Woodend, Hague
Bar and Brookbottom. Close by are the towns of Marple and New Mills
and the villages of Mellor and Rowarth. Nearby is the hamlet of
Turf Lea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is served by Strines railway station on the Hope Valley
Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Well done
to Rigsby's Mob for FTF!&lt;/strong&gt;

The car parking spot at N53° 22.913  W002° 18.150 can only fit one car but is usually empty. Other parking close by. Look out for the sheep (and their poop) as they're all over the place. There's a small pond nearby at the co-ords given if your dog wants a drink.

There's some barbed wire near the cache hence the rating so be careful you don't get prickled. </groundspeak:long_description>

J4 is one of those wierd junctions where you can only get off, or get back on, the motorway in one direction.

Small parking area at 53-22.926N / 002-16.788W. As there's a school just around the corner it's best not to visit about 9:00am or 3:00pm Mon-Fri as it gets very busy.

Is placed just off a public footpath between an old derelict cottage and the 'housing estate' built for the new series. Quite what a cottage is doing in the middle of this industrial park is a bit of a mystery. If anyone knows the history of it please leave comments. Also around the corner you can see the 'inside' of one of the houses and the pretend police station.

Parking is freely available nearby but watch for the double-yellow lines. Best time to visit is the evening or weekend as it's very quiet then apart from the odd pedestrian taking a shortcut down the path from Tesco to the nearby hospital and beyond.

The cache is a small sandwich clip n' seal box large enough for coins and a few odds and ends. You'll need to be quite nimble to get to it and be careful of the brambles and nettles.</groundspeak:long_description>

Beware you're being watched by at least three cctv cameras.

Thanks to other cachers we now know this is what remains of Brunswick Methodist Chapel (Wesleyan). Founded 1826. Registers 1826–1837 are at the Cheshire Record Office. Registers of marriages 1905–1953 are at Manchester Central Library.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;It is a small tub with a screw on lid, measuring about 7cm x 7cm
x 7cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is located about half a mile from the carpark at the end of
Maitland Avenue, located at N 53 25.418 W 002 16.002. (This is the
same car park as we suggest you use for Chorlton
Waterpark, though the cache is in the opposite direction.) The
car park gets locked round about dusk - check the sign, but there
is a small part of the car park outside the gate if you think you
will be staying later&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A cache in Southern Cemetery close to the central chapel. A small klik n' lock box accessible by wheelchair and well away from the gravestones. You don't have to leave the path to find this one. Please put the cache back carefully as the gardeners are quite keen. Of interest, in the direction of the Eastern chapel, is the Masonic pathway dating back to the late 1800's - look for the symbols.

Some famous graves to look out for while here are:

Alcock, John William. b. November 6, 1892. Aviator. Plot G966
Busby, Matt. b. May 26, 1909. British Football Player, Manager. Plot G997
Lowry, L.S. b. November 1, 1887. Artist. Plot C772
Meredith, Billy. b. July 24, 1874. British (Welsh) Footballer. Plot Y760

&lt;p&gt;Starting from Birchwood Forest Park, N53 25.611 W002 30.564 is

than the Angel of the North. I will let you judge that for
yourself. (See photo or visit

details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pestfurlong Hill is about as big as the hills get in Warrington,
however it is a good viewpoint of the local countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other caches in different Warrington Parks . Please
visit more of them as they are a good mixture of urban &amp; rural
parks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

So this is the replacement :-)

Some people love them, some hate them, but the fact is that magnetic nanos are here to stay!

nano is wheelchair accessible, final cache is not.
Not recommended during or directly after heavy rain.

Urban nanos are everywhere, half the time with no space in the tiny scrap of paper that serves as a log to squeeze your name in!

Rather than jam a minuscule log into this tiny container that I would need to change every 6 finders. I decided to put the co-ordinates of a much bigger better cache

There is no trickery or fiendish puzzles here, no need to count anything or work out which letter matches up with which number. Simply find the nano, open it up and get the final co-ords. (please dont sign the paper in the nano, its not a log!)


This cache is located on the Manchester cycleway, best way to access is by bike!

Historically a significant Victorian park, Alexandra Park has retained its appeal and is a true community park in 2007. The annual Caribbean Carnival takes place in Alexandra Park, alongside regular amateur football games, 5K runs and health walks lead by the dedicated park wardens.

For information regarding the regular 5K runs in Alexandra Park, please visit the Open Athletics - Alexandra Park webpage. The 5ks have been taking place since July 2005 and they are organised with the collaboration of the Friends of Alexandra Park. The runs are under UK Athletics Rules and the course is a certified accurate 5k course by UK Athletics. The race is ideal for novices, but it is also a fast course for experienced runners.

The Friends of Alexandra Park is a dedicated voluntary group of local residents founded in 2001. The group was set up to help change the image of the Park and to raise funds for the improvement of the Park. The Friends encourage people to make greater use of Alexandra Park, help the Park staff, and arrange and support events throughout the year.

If it falls out the cache will be visible to every passing muggle The cache is a small lock n lock that on placing contains Logbook and pencil Scout badge Baloons Mini karabiner Glow bracelet The bit of waste land at the end of Range Road was originally intened to have 2 semi detached houses built on it but these never came to fruition, allowed to become overgrown Nobody thought much of it. A local resident once laid a kind of path through it but this quickly became smothered with brambles... Recently a group of Community Payback workers put the site to rights removing all the undergrowth and thinning out the trees while a chainsaw artist created sculptured from the remaining tree stumps. While you are in the area you might want to stop by the park for a quick stroll and another cache.   </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed close to one of the great Manchester landmarks, the Manchester Ship Canal and offers a view of that modern temple to retail therapy, the Trafford Centre. It is also a few moments walk from one of the engineering marvels of the British Waterways.

The Barton Swing Aqueduct was designed by Sir Edward Leader Williams and opened in 1893. It carries the Bridgewater Canal over the Manchester Ship Canal as it passes through Barton-upon-Irwell.

In its closed position, the aqueduct allows canal traffic to pass along the Bridgewater Canal. However, when large vessels need to pass along the Ship Canal, the massive iron trough (234ft long and weighing 800 tonnes) can be swung through ninety degrees via a pivot mounted on a small, purpose-built island in the Ship Canal. Gates at either end of the trough retain around 800 tonnes of water within the trough; further gates on either bank retain water in their adjacent stretches of canal.

This aqueduct is one of the original &quot;Seven Wonders of the Waterways&quot; as compiled by Robert Aickman (co-founder of the Inland Waterways Association) and published in his book Know Your Waterways.

The cache is a small tupperware container painted black and hidden at ground level</groundspeak:long_description>

I remember when this road used to go all the way through to the main road (before it was Trafford Boulevard). It used to be a great cut through when the bridge had swung and the main road was backed up with traffic.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This multi stage cache Takes you on a breif tour round north campus
of the University of Manchester (formally UMIST) The terrain should
be wheelchair accessible for all stages but there is a steep ramp
to get to the final stage, and for stage 1 the information is at
the top of about 5 steps. The cache container is quite small (large
micro or small small, room for geocoins etc but not much more)

&lt;p&gt;UMIST started life as the Manchester Mechanics Institute, later
becoming the Manchester Municipal School of Technology and later
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
(UMIST) In 2004 UMIST was merged with the Victoria University of
Manchester forming the combined University Of Manchester. Since the
merger North Campus as it is now known has been systematically run
down with the intention of selling most of it off for development,
This has not been very popular with a lot of staff and students at
UMIST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache takes you on a short tour of the campus showing off
some of the Architecture and sculptures that adorn the campus,
along with as many remnants form UMIST that have not yet been re
branded by the University of Manchester&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to show hidden
waypoints, The instructions for finding the coordinates are in the
way point descriptions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you may want to bring a calculator with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 takes you to the main entrance of what is now called the
Sackville street building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 is at a Giant Vimpto bottle, Vimpto was originally
invented in a small hut near to this sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 Archimedes is having a bath here, dont forget to stop by
and grab GC1TKAH while you are here (the waypoint coords are GZ for
GC1TKAH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 4 Jackson's Mill was originally a cotton mill as the name
suggests, now it houses some of Chemical Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 5 The Ferranti Building houses the High Voltage Lab for
testing power components, much of the work here is done on behalf
of national grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 6. The Pariser building houses the school of Mechanical
Aeorospace and Civil Engineering (MACE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 7, The now defunct Faraday tower Used to hold maths and
Social Silences, but since the merger they have been moved to
oxford road. The building cannot be reused due to large quantities
of asbestos used in construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final stage, The cache is located near the George Begg building
which houses some of MACE and is the home of the Formula Student
team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In case you have printed this without hidden waypoints I have
repeated them here&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;stage 4&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the access gate to Jacksons mill&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
N53° 28.4XX&lt;br/&gt;
W02° 13.865&lt;br/&gt;
where X is the last digit of A&lt;br/&gt;
so if that were a 1 (its not) it would be 28.411&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Count the UMIST shields, This is [D] (2 digit number)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Stage 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a family of something interesting here, but how many
are there [E] (1 digit number)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
N53° 28.4Y&lt;br/&gt;
W02° 13.9Y&lt;br/&gt;
where Y is B+C+D-5 (2 digit number)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;FINAL&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N53° {C+5} . E,{(DxG)-1}&lt;br/&gt;
W02° {(H+5} . {(BxD)+C}&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will also need the value of&lt;br/&gt;
A + F (4 digit number)&lt;br/&gt;

Part of the pennington flash country park, this is a very high muggle area, please be careful when retrieving and replace exactly as found please.
While you are here why not extend your walk to take a look at the Flash itself, a large body of water created by mining subsidence. The Country Park is renowned for its birdlife so bring some binoculars with you. There are several bird hides, a childrens play area, picnic areas and a good network of footpaths. More information can be found through the Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust homepage. </groundspeak:long_description>

On the 15th June 1996 The IRA demolished this part of Manchester with A car bomb.

Thankfully nobody lost their life in the explosion although 212 people were injured. 
A nearby pillar box was the only object to remain undamaged in the immediate area and now carries a plaque commemorating the event


Since then the entire area has been regenerated with an enormous wheel offering a great view of the whole city (even if the commentary is a bit annoying) This cache is in the shadow of the wheel so some stealth is needed to retrive

note that the tall buildings around here make GPS reception sketchy at best, the Co-ords are as accurate as I can get them but they may well show a considerable distance out </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>A much smaller wheel than the big one, hubwards</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

not the coordinates for the cache; they are the centre of a

that I have for the co-ordinates &lt;strong&gt;681561198 -
48820053&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do remember is that the location was on the Northeast
side of a small ridge at the base of a tree under some logs and old
branches. Also 6 feet away is a hole that is about 18&quot; square and
and the same depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is full of the usual goodies&lt;/p&gt;

     and Roe Green Loop line. &lt;br/&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;I would recommend parking in Monton where there is a free car
park which is protected with security cameras. This can be found at
53° 29.473N, 002° 21.086W [&lt;b&gt;SJ 76780 99453&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On foot Exit the car park and turn right up the high street
towards the roundabout. Cross the road at the roundabout to the
shelter on the other side onto Broad Oak Road a short walk up Broad
Oak Road leads to a public footpath which crosses Worsley Golf
Club. Walk up this foot path to where it splits and take the left
hand branch straight across the top end of the golf course. Follow
this path until it comes onto Chatsworth Road, turn left onto
Chatsworth Road and follow that for a very short distance down a
hill to a footpath sign. Join this footpath and from there I think
let your GPS do the talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache contains the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logbook and Pencil c/w rubber and a sharpener. Padlock and keys,
3 balloons, UV marker pen, mini keyring calculator, clip, 3 x
paperclips, mini craft pegs, and a thimble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice walk back to your car is along the line in a southerly
direction back towards Monton village.&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is the nearest official footpath. You can approach from Pear Tree Avenue in Coppull, like I did, and follow the pleasant path across the field, down the steps, and over the bridge to GZ, or you can come the Sharrats Path route.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At the head of Yarrow Reservoir is an area named Meeting Of The Waters.  Unsuprisingly, two rivers meet here - Limestone Brook and the River Yarrow.

The River Yarrow is in Lancashire, with its source at an area called Will Narr at Hordern Stoops, along Spitlers Edge - the Chorley/Blackburn boundary.

Limestone Brook has its source near to Devils Ditch, and flows via Shooting Huts on Anglezarke moor where it travels through Lead Mines Clough before joining the Yarrow.

This spot is very near to Lollybob's ace BMR2 cache - too close, in fact, if you follow GC.COM's proximity rules (there's a natural boundary in the river, but there's a bridge).  Meeting Of The Waters is a spot that many have walked past, but I dare say that few have visited.  Take some photos from the waters edge, and post them on your log!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Go to the waters edge at the tip where the waters meet. Back from the edge, equidistant from the two waters, is a large tree with a horizontal leg sticking out from it. It's at the base of this tree. The tree is on a step-change in elevation.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Walk down the unmarked (aka secret) path alongside the river, crossing the fence where possible.  Don't worry, you're allowed to do so - this is Open Access land, but please be careful.

Once you have crossed, then you can make your way up the gorge to the cache.  Take a camera - it's a really nice spot! And after the cache, keep going - there's a pool to look at, too.</groundspeak:long_description>

These particular ruins are marked as such on the older OS maps (1950's edition), but as they are in such a state of disrepair, they've been removed from modern editions. There's actually very little in terms of the farm to see here, but you can get a feel for the outline of the buildings.

What's more important, perhaps, is that this is a very nice spot, where the River Yarrow flows, with a stream adjoining at this point too. It's a secluded little valley that would have been one of the more hospitable parts of the moors. I certainly wouldn't mind a nights camping here!

This particular property was one of several given up by Mr G. M. Dixon of the Liverpool Corporation in 1922. The location is near to Peewet Hall, and was farmed by members of the Cocker (of the famous Moses Cocker and his flying machine) family in the 1700s.

By the early 1800s this was owned by the Pilkington's along with the landmark farm near Great Hill, Drinkwaters. Mr Dixon wrote to the Lord Mayor, Alderman and Citizens of the City of Liverpool, stating &quot;I give notice to quit all lands I hold under Liverpool Corporation on February End, 1923..... owing to the high rates and the heavy slump in prices, especially wool, the chief thing on a hill farm.&quot; </groundspeak:long_description>

Locked the car and off I went taking the path from Alance Bridge climbing onto the moors and then across a field towards GZ passing a couple who had just made it up the hill from Lead Mines. On arriving at GZ looked around and spotted a likely hide so took a seat next to it and bingo we have a turtle. Signed the log and replaced the cache. Took in the views while composing myself for the walk back and updating my status on that facebook thingy. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This gate has always been a so-called access point above Lead Mines Clough. I say 'so-called' as it doesn't appear to be an access point to anywhere.

I walked through it a couple of years ago, and presumed the gate was redundant, as you are confronted by a wall of conifer (or are you?).

On walking up here a few weeks back, the gate has been renewed, complete with substantial concrete ballasts. It's obviously current, and of use.

It's not on the maps, although it is next to the Secret Path that runs around the outer edge of Lead Mines woodland.

The question is... why is it here, and where does it go?

There are many paths around the moors that aren't public footpaths, yet are common routes used by walkers. Anglezarke Moor is Open Access land, with full Right To Roam rights - and some of the &quot;secret&quot; paths are actually better trodden than the marked ROWs.

This is an area where there is supposed to be a Holy Well. In ancient times, there probably was, but the structure of ground around it has since disappeared. There are water pools here, so there's no doubt that you are in the right location, but nothing jumps out as being of great religious value.

Holy wells were so named because they were reputed to have healing properties. For instance, if a walker had an aching foot, they could dip it in the water and supposedly it would heal. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is hidden in Scroggs Wood, an area of (ancient?) woodland marking part of the southern border of Kendal. The woodland is managed by the Woodland Trust and links to a larger section of wood along the river Kent.

The section of the wood along the river is a SSSI - this section is not, but please respect the woodland and don't take any short cuts - you really don't need to! There's a bridge across the beck where it meets the river, at the bottom of the lane.

I'd recommend exploring the riverside path, either towards Kendal (turn left at the river) or towards Sedgewick (turn right) and take in some or all of Safie's Sedgewick Saunter or Safie's West Bank Wander.

There's a small car parking area (enough for 2 cars) specifically for the wood just off the A6 by the Hadwins used car dealership. There's also a small area down the lane.

The cache box itself may not be totally waterproof. It might get damp. Please put
things into the little plastic bags inside. Just in case!

to enable it to be hidden in sight of all passers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The co-ordinates are for
the end of the wall and not the cache itself, gps fixes were taken
over several days at different times of day and
averaged.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to reflect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Follow your GPS to the co-ordinates and have a look around, you
will find the cache very close by, it is not hidden in the wall, if
you need more help use the hint.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;There are offices and
private residences close by so you will need to be stealthy in your
retrieval.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Area History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gooseholme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gooseholme used to be an island between two branches of the
river Kent, one of these is now filled in. The branches joined
again just above the mill race for Kendal Mill and there was
probably also a conduit to feed the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
The area is now a public park with an 18 hole putting green. There
are also several benches along the river bank where you can sit and
listen to the gentle sound of the water passing by.&lt;br/&gt;
On the east bank next to the weir there is a kiosk that serves hot
and cold snacks and beverages.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aynam Mills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severely gutted by fire in 1983, but re-built and now occupied
by local businesses. Originally housed the Illingworth Snuff
factory, which closed after the fire.&lt;br/&gt;
The buildings across the road from the cache were once The Aynam
Woollen Mill and was occupied in 1873 by George J McKay, at the
time was described as a woollen merchant and horse-clothing
manufacturer. The buildings were once occupied by a garage, but
more recently by South Lakes Housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filled in mill race:&lt;/strong&gt; If you stand near the
Scout's flag pole looking south you can see a car park, this was
originally a mill race, some 40 feet wide, and about 20 feet
deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mill race bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the Southern mill
race bridge, designed by Francis Webster and built in 1818. The
bridge had four arches and carried traffic from Kent Street, across
Miller Bridge and on into Canal Head. Only the bridge's parapet can
now be seen, with the rest of the bridge buried beneath the
car-park and the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second mill race bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the Northern
mill race bridge, possibly built about the same time as the
Southern bridge. Again it has been buried with only the parapets
remaining visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1st Kendal Scouts&lt;/h3&gt;
The hut next to the wall you will sit on is owned by the 1st Kendal
Scouts, Who can be traced back to 1911, just four years since the
formation of the Scout Movement.&lt;br/&gt;
At that time they were the 1st Kendal (Lady Bagot's Own) and each
year the lads would pull their trek-cart down to Levens Hall to be
inspected by their patron.&lt;br/&gt;
It is know that during the First World War the members of the troop
helped at the rehabilitation hospital for wounded soldiers in
Kendal. In pairs they also guarded the railway bridges on the main
line.&lt;br/&gt;
If they enemy attacked, one Scout had to run back into Kendal to
call out the militia!
&lt;p&gt;The Group was lost track of until it was reformed in the 1950's
and met for sometime at the YMCA in Highgate and at various other
venues. Then a dynamic group of parents helped to fund and build
their own Headquarters on Little Aynam in Kendal - where they are
today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Please help keep this area tidy and CITO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is our first hide, hope you enjoy it :-)&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Serpentine Woods looks over Kendal towards the town and the
castle.&lt;br/&gt;
A sculpture trail was placed in Serpentine Woods during the 1970s,
but fell into decay. A new trail was opened in 2007. The woods were
originally grazing land and part of Kendal Fell. The area was
historically called &lt;i&gt;Dob Frear&lt;/i&gt;, which is supposedly Old Norse
for Free Land. The wood has long been open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council have asked that I point out that there is the golf
course to the West and North and a nature conservation area to the
North. &lt;i&gt;If you plan on taking in a few of the nearby
Roboes’ caches, or heading over to Cunswick scar, Please
stick to the marked paths&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start, I want you to have a little look into the
history of the woods. So your first clue is an armchair (or
library?) clue. In what year was the summerhouse within the wood
built? The answer may also be available at the summerhouse itself.
(&lt;i&gt;N54 19.672 W002 45.267&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;=first digit + last digit Check – add all
numbers to get 15&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of parking in Kendal town centre, but
you’ll have to climb Beast Banks, and you might never find
your way back out of the one-way system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates given are approximate due to the tree cover. It
should be obvious what you are looking for, so accuracy isn’t
that important. If you want a little extra help, a guide to the
alphabet trail is available at the Kendal Tourist Information
Centre (N54 19.614 W002 44.842).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The letters used for each clue correspond to the initial
letter of the relevant sculpture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some may be high.&lt;br/&gt;
Some may be low.&lt;br/&gt;
Others may be obvious,&lt;br/&gt;
Some not quite so.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your starting point is &lt;i&gt;The Tram&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;N54 19.724 W002
45.201&lt;/i&gt;). This is a very unusual name, especially as Kendal
never had trams. I’ve tried to discover something of the
Etymology of the name. The first record is of ‘Tram
Close’ a small parcel of land sold in 1746.&lt;br/&gt;
A short distance Northwest of here is an old mint cake quarry,
which fell out of use following the invention of a synthetic
alternative that was much cheaper to produce. The Quiggins factory
at the foot of Beast Banks is on the site of the original mint cake
refinery. I suspect what is now the bridleway may have been a
tramway to get the raw cake down to the refinery. However, there is
no evidence for this tramway other than the name and the route of
the bridleway.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the gate. You’ll see a large seed.&lt;br/&gt;
How many letters in the plant this will grow into?  
 &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.721 W002 45.209&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the path to a large tree at a junction of paths.&lt;br/&gt;
How many bolts hold the creature to the tree?  
 &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.724 W002 45.269&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go round to the left. Continue past the little folk’s
swimming pool.&lt;br/&gt;
How many vertical parts?    &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.715 W002 45.342&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-back along the higher path. Keep looking all
around.&lt;br/&gt;
How many leaves?    &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.736 W002 45.354&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry on to the end of this path and turn left.&lt;br/&gt;
How many legs on this bench?    &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.792 W002 45.381&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many Magpies?     &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.797 W002 45.416&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the path, past the Nest by GCNQQ9,
Wainwright’s Kendal View.&lt;br/&gt;
Continue to follow the path round to the left, past a wise old
bird. Rest your weary feet on the Pheasant if you so wish. Watch
out for the Rat and the Spider. Go round to the left and through
the Tunnel to a junction of lots of paths.&lt;br/&gt;
If its raining you could stay dry here under a tree that sounds
just like this letter, possibly. How many radial arms?  
  &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.705 W002 45.382&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the right hand path – the least obvious path.&lt;br/&gt;
How many petals?     &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N 54 19.676 W002 45.387&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a musical interlude.&lt;br/&gt;
How many notes on the instrument?     &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N 54 19.675 W002 45.334&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;cache&lt;/i&gt; is at:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N54 19.U(X+M)(C+G)&lt;br/&gt;
W002 45.ASV&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick check that you’ve got the right numbers:&lt;br/&gt;
A+C+G+I+S = 24&lt;br/&gt;
L+M+U+V+X = 26&lt;br/&gt;
The item referred to in the clue is nearby, but the clue is
intended to give a little help as the gps is likely to be a bit out
with the tree cover. The cache coordinates were averaged over two
three-minute sessions, so should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summerhouse referred to in the armchair clue is just down
the steps to the north of X, and turn right. (&lt;i&gt;N54 19.672 W002
45.267&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
Following this path past the summerhouse will bring you out of the
woods at the top of Serpentine Road. Turn left along the road to
get back to The Tram. Alternatively, explore the woods some more
– you’ll soon come to a familiar landmark.&lt;/p&gt;

The Rey Cross

In AD954 Stainmore was the site of an important battle fought between the Viking army of King Eric Bloodaxe and their enemies which included the Angles of Northumbria, north of the Tees.

Eric Bloodaxe was a red-headed Norseman who had a Danish mother. He was one of the most notorious of Viking kings with an heroic reputation for success in battle both in Norway and overseas. Eric’s luck finally ran out at Stainmore when his Viking army were heavily defeated. Bloodaxe, along with five other loyal Viking leaders, lost their lives.

The point where Eric Bloodaxe met his death is marked by the ancient Rey Cross. The cross was set up by Edmund, King of Northumbria to mark the boundary between Northumbria, England and Strathclyde, Scotland. It was, originally, a wheel0headed cross, which stood around en feet high and had carvings down two sides of the shaft, but all that is left now, is the top part of the shaft and the base plinth. The carvings can no longer be seen.

The Rey Cross once stood a little west of its current location, on the south-side of the road, in the Roman Marching Camp, but was moved when the road was widened and now stands on the north-side of the road and can be access from the east-bound carriage-way only.

Rey is a Viking word which means boundary.


The cache is only big enough for a log book and a small pencil but you may need to bring your own pen/pencil as the pencil we included is not very big.

Please sign the log with name and date only please.

Please replace the cache in exactly the same location and orientation as you find it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Slightly disappointed that it wasn't a *unique* OC cache (obviously has been listed on GC for quite a while due to the many signatures in the book), so no FTF then... (?) In any case, I choose to log it on this site.Anyway, this was also our first cache in the UK on route to Scotland. Nice safe place to park and easy stroll up the hill. Cache was quite well hidden and not immediately obvious. Expected a really big container as the description stated 'large', but the cache was quite small, smaller than most regular sized caches. The bunny holes were a slight hazard (not to mention the droppings!) but we found a reasonably suitable place to sit and admire our first taste of hilly views.Unfortunately, there was a poor dead sheep lying beside the road near our car which started to smell a bit when the wind changed so we didn't stick around by the roadside! I do wonder how many sheep the farmers lose on those roads...Thanks for the cache and greetings from Australia and the Netherlands!</groundspeak:text>

Blaze Fell is located in the Eden Valley between Penrith &amp; Carlisle just off the A6 is seldom walked which is a shame because its a relatively easy walk with the reward of fabulous views from the Trig Point towards Blencathra &amp; the Northern Lakes, Cross Fell &amp; the Northern Pennines, the Solway and Dumfries &amp; Galloway. 

Parking &amp; permitted acess is available at N54 47 154 W002 46 009 - NY 50784 43713 keep to the permitted footpath as you walk uphill through several field (the perimeter of the fields are fenced with the top line of wire (4' high) being electrified - there is absolutly no need to be anyway near the fencing but it may be worth keeping mini cachers away from the fence lines - all access points i.e. gates are safe - the final field gate takes you to the summit area which has in the past been quarried for sandstone.

The walk through the fields is a premitted acces to give entry to the open access land on the summit - so the landowner is quite within his rights to fence his land as he sees fit.

If you can thread you way through the quarried area towards the Trip Point and you are very close to our hidden cache - however if you would like to avoid the rocky ground - from the gate in the boundry wall follow the track ahead until you see the fenceline ahead - now follow the indistinct track to the trig point.

Our clue is Heather says - add the Trip Point Numerals thats the number of paces you are away from our cache in a North Westerly direction.

Cache contains Logbook - pens - GPS landyards - Mega Scotalnd Key Rings.

This is quite a simple cache, and consists of a screw top 0.33L beaker.  Park at 54°55.333'N, 2°18.505'W or there's abouts and toodle down to the cache site.

When I walked past the farm I was amazed to see a MkII Bailey Bridge, 1940's vintage.  One of those un sung bits of kit that helped win the war.

The footpath goes straight across the field, The cache is hidden up near the gate.

The byways are marked at thier start/end and for the intrepid ones.. a very pleasant walk if the weather is kind.

The cache is on a byway and has several possible approaches.  The actual location is very quiet and tranquil. A canny spot for a brew.

You can come from the West BM1, the turning for the byway just 50 or so meters from Langley Castle. This is initially quite steep and once you get up into the fields one section is quite boggy and lible to be worse in inclement weather.  4x4 recommended.

You can approach from the East (BM2) which would give you a walk/ride/drive of about 500mtrs.  Or you can approach from the South along another section of Byway (BM3).

The cache is a small click lock box, but will take small swops, coins, TB's etc.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A pleasant walk up an old drove road.   The terrain rating is for the Copper Snout return route.

Clennell Street has been used for centuries. In Old English 'street' meant road, and this particular one must have been popular because in the main it follows the tops of the ridges avoiding the steep drops into, and climbs out of, the many valleys. Clennell Street runs for 19km from Alwinton to Cocklawfoot at the head of the River Bowmont in Scotland.  Border Reivers, smugglers, pedlars and drovers have all passed this way in their time.

On the left is Castle Hill with a prehistoric, probably Iron Age, hill fort on its summit. There is another one on Clennell Hill, to the right above the valley of the River Alwin. Lord's Seat the hill to the north of the Hosedon Burn gullies are traces of cultivation of four different periods.

On the eastern side of Clennell Street as it curves to the left around Uplaw Knowe show traces of Romano/British settlements. They are not easy to see, but point to the fact the area was inhabited long, long ago and perhaps carried a greater population than it does now.

Wholehope Cottage was once a Youth Hostel but was found to be too far off the beaten track to be properly managed, so was abandond. It is nothing more than a pile of rubble now and one piece of wall.  There is a make shift hut here that can be used for shelter from the incesant wind and a good place for a lunch break.

From here you have a choice of three return routes the first being an obvious back track. The second to carry on for 0.75 miles and then take the track to the left, over Copper Snout to Shillmoor and then across and over Pass Peth back to Alwinton.

The last is to carry on to the forest road, about 300 yards and turn right to Kidlandlee then down to the floor of the River Alwin valley and follow the road back, past Clennel Hall to Alwinton.

The cache is one of my pots, as usual! and contains the usual nick nacks and some of my keyfobs.

You can park at Alwinton carpark. 55°21.057'N, 2°07.693'W (NT 91968 06335)

Remember that these may be small hills but unforgiving.  In cold weather, as it was when I planted the cache, everything was frozen, the wind bitting.  In summer there are areas that are little more than bog.  On that the majority of the tracks are good. 

Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a simple cache. Well. Simple to find once you reach the location.


I have walked these hills for many a year and never knew about Wholehope Still,  This is a whiskey still that was in existence in the 1800.  It probably sold illicit liquor to the infamous Slime foot pub further up the Coquet valley.

This is a plain, and simple cache,  and is the first of a series that will go to make up the Cheviot whiskey still ramble, believe that you believe owt.

The cache is easy enough to find.. the challenge is getting to it.  Access is by planning your route, and an understanding that a steep slope on the map IS a steep slope on the ground.  In the summer it isn’t a gentle stroll and in the winter could be fraught with danger.  Look at the map,  plan your route, and be prepared for an adventure and hard slog.

If it looks vertical on the map then it IS vertical on the ground.  How they ever got the whiskey out is any ones guess.

The cache is one of my usual pots with usual bits n bobs. 

Enjoy the walk which aint a one in a park.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Wyndy Gyle &amp; Beyond...... Not for the faint hearted.

Wyndy Gyle is a hill on the border ridge between Scotland &amp;
England. To find the cache you need to find Russells Cairn, which
is predominant on the hill. The cairn is thought to be a
prehistoric burial mound, but the name comes from the Reiver period
of Anglo/Scottish history.
&lt;p&gt;The Reiver period (briefly) stemed from when the Scots kicked
the English out of Scotland. There was a lot of distrust between
both sides so settlers, from both sides, were inticed into the
borders with a pledge of land in return for being in a militia to
fight the other side in case of war. This meant that both England
and Scotland had men at arms on the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems came with the system called Gavelkind, being, when
a man died his land was split equally between his sons. In a
relativley short period, families took to stealing to sustain
themselves and eventually theiving (Reiving) was rife along the
border. Scot from Englishman and visa versa, not to mention from
feuding families. Thus the Border Reivers were born, and the riding
surnames (Clans) were the most notorious, Armstrong, Elliot, Nixon
to name but 3 out of 70 plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually some way of restoring order was inplace (it never
worked), and the border was split into 6 Marches, three in Scotland
and three in England, each over seen by a March Warden (usually
worse than the Reivers themselves). About once a quarter a meeting
was held between the wardens of opposing marches (Truce Days!!) on
neutral ground, usually on the border. It was on one of these
'truce' days, at Wyndy Gyle (28th July 1585) when Lord Francis
Russell attended the meeting &quot; fer certain particular causes of his
own&quot; whilst talking to some gentlemen, &quot;was suddenly shot with a
gun and slain&quot; the ensuing melee ended in several deaths, and
rumour has it the hanging of the assailant, a young lad. Since that
day the cairn has been called Russells Cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the cache first locate the trig point on top of the
cairn, project a line from there at 58 degrees (don't forget 4
degrees west for variation) for 450 meters, there you should find a
second cairn, 6ft northward is a mini cairn marking the spot. The
contents are couple of CD's, other nick nacks and TIGGER!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tigger wants to travel, he wants to go around the world and
end up back at Wyndy Gyle, he has his travelog so his progress can
be tracked so if anyone has a mind please help tigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cheviot hills are unforgiving, just because the weather is
nice when you start don't mean it will be when you finish.
Inclement weather here is 50 knot winds and horizontal rain. If it
is wet you will need good boots, waterproofs, gaiters as the border
ridge is very boggy in wet weather. That being said, if you make it
up there on a good day the veiw is glorious, Scotland to the north,
England to the south and if your very quiet you may hear, on the
wind, the thunder of hooves and the clash of steel as the Reivers
ply their trade. PS.. When you leave don't forget to close the gate
into Scotland!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is my little screw top beaker. again.. :O) Getting to
Linhope Spout is a grade 1.5 walk, getting the cache in just as
easy. You MUST park the car, if yer using one, at the edge of the
road just before Hartside Farm. Then it is a pleasing walk, up and
down hill but not strenuous. Then a drop down into the sheltered
area of the waterfall. Very little wind, it is naturally sheltered
and ideal to just be with nature and Mother earth. Best way to cope
is take a picnic so family can enjoy the tranquility while the dare
devil hunts the cache :O) Enjoy.. Moss Trooper is a founder member

&lt;p&gt;The line orginally opened in 1901 and used for both passenger and goods transport.  The line ran from a fork at Monktonhall where it connected to the main East Coast Line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to it's name the line never quite made it Garvald, only stretching as far as Gifford.  There were stations at Ormiston (Macmerry on a seperate branch line), Pencaitland, Salton, Humbie and Gifford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goods transported on the line were agricultural produce, coal and the whiskey produced at Glenkinchie Distillery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenkinchie Distillery has been operating (legally) since 1837 when it was operated by George Rate &amp; Sons.  It was closed in 1853 then reopened by a consortium of Edinburgh merchants who created the Glenkinchie Distillery Co. Ltd.  In 1914 it became part of Scottish Malt Distillers and subsequently Diageo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not intended on placing a cache this far up the Railway Walk as Jack Aubrey &amp; Firth of Forth had one up here but i noticed it had recently been archived.

The Yew Tree

 My bonnie yew tree
     Tell me what did you see

 A mile frae Pentcaitland, on the road to the sea
 Stands a yew tree a thousand years old
 And the old women swear by the grey o' their hair
 That it knows what the future will hold
 For the shadows of Scotland stand round it
 'Mid the kail and the corn and the kye
 All the hopes and the fears of a thousand long years
 Under the Lothian sky

 Did you look through the haze o' the lang summer days
 Tae the South and the far English border
 A' the bonnets o' steel on Flodden's far field
 Did they march by your side in good order
 Did you ask them the price o' their glory
 When you heard the great slaughter begin
 For the dust o' their bones would rise up from the stones
 To bring tears to the eyes o' the wind

 Not once did you speak for the poor and the weak
 When the moss-troopers lay in your shade
 To count out the plunder and hide frae the thunder
 And share out the spoils o' their raid
 But you saw the smiles o' the gentry
 And the laughter of lords at their gains
 When the poor hunt the poor across mountain and moor
 The rich man can keep them in chains

 Did you no' think tae tell when John Knox himsel'
 Preached under your branches sae black
 To the poor common folk who would lift up the yoke
 O' the bishops and priests frae their backs
 But you knew the bargain he sold them
 And freedom was only one part
 For the price o' their souls was a gospel sae cold
 It would freeze up the joy in their hearts

 And I thought as I stood and laid hands on your wood
 That it might be a kindness to fell you
 One kiss o' the axe and you're freed frae the racks
 O' the sad bloody tales that men tell you
 But a wee bird flew out from your branches
 And sang out as never before
 And the words o' the song were a thousand years long
 And to learn them's a long thousand more

 My bonnie yew tree
 Tell me what CAN you see

 
The cache is no longer located inside the cathedral-like chamber created by the Yew Tree
 but the additional waypoint below will take you to the entrance.  I would urge you to have
look inside.  Wheelchairs/buggies would be able to get as far as the entrance.

The cache is now located a short walk from the Yew Tree.

The paths are generally in very good condition but after heavy rainfall they can be muddy and good boots may be required after prolonged wet weather. The section between Kingfisher Bridge and Ormiston can often be flooded in winter but there are opportunities to cross the ditch into the neighbouring field.

The cache is a small lock &amp; lock container. 

The full loop is around 5 miles long - maphttp://www.wintonhouse.co.uk/pdf/walks.pdf

If completing the series i would suggest parking at Ormiston Station (see additional waypoint).

The path are generally in very good condition but after heavy rainfall they can be muddy and good boots may be required after prolonged wet weather. The section between Kingfisher Bridge and Ormiston can often be flooded in winter but there are opportunities to cross the ditch into the neighbouring field.

The cache is a small lock &amp; lock container.  If you follow the path beside the river you will get a good view of Winton House which is still the family home of Sir Francis and Lady Ogilvy.

The full loop is around 5 miles long - map http://www.wintonhouse.co.uk/pdf/walks.pdf

If completing the series i would suggest parking at Ormiston Station (see additional waypoint).

The line orginally opened in 1901 and used for both passenger and goods transport.  The line ran from a fork at Monktonhall where it connected to the main East Coast Line.  
Contrary to it's name the line never quite made it Garvald, only stretching as far as Gifford.  There were stations at Ormiston (Macmerry on a seperate branch line), Pencaitland, Salton, Humbie and Gifford.
The primary goods transported on the line were agricultural produce, coal and the whiskey produced at Glenkinchie Distillery.

&lt;p&gt;Fa'side castle was built in the 14th century by the De Quincey
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name dates from 1189, when the monks of Newbattle Abbey
granted land to the De Quincy family to build the castle on the
site. The land was lost to Robert the Bruce after the De Quincy
family declared their loyalty to Edward I of England. (An
alternative view is that it was held by Alan la Zouche, 1st Baron
la Zouche of Ashby.) Bruce granted the castle to the Seton
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle was burned by the English before the Battle of Pinkie
Cleugh in 1547 (See my other cache Bloody Saturday GC2AGZ3) ,
suffocating or burning all those inside. It was rebuilt in the late
16th Century and sold in 1631 to an Edinbugh burgess and merchant
called Hamilton. By the 19th Century, it had fallen into ruin, and
was close to being demolished altogether in the 1970s. However, the
castle was saved and underwent restoration by Thomas Moodie Craig.
Nigel Tranter set up the Fa'side Restoration Society in 1970
through the St. Andrews Society of East Lothian, and introduced Tom
Craig to the castle in 1975. After investigation it was discovered
that the original name of the castle was Fawside Castle and this
remains its name today. The restoration work began in 1976 was
completed by 1982. The castle is now privately owned. The Fa'side
Estate includes a stud farm and a Bed &amp; Breakfast business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can be approached via the single track road that runs
from Tranent to Crookston or from Wallyford which has very good
public transport links (44 bus service or Edinburgh-N Berwick
trains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The coal seam at Tranent was referred to as the Great Seam as it
was over 7ft deep in sections. Fleets Colliery was the main pit in
the area. The first shaft was sunk in 1866 and operated for nearly
100 years. By the time of it's closure in 1959 there were two
shafts, one 73m and the other 154m deep. In 1948 during its peak
output the mine was producing 191,500 tons per annum and employed
816 men and women. The coal was initially transported to Cockenzie
Harbour by rail for export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleets was a very wet pit hence a
cornish beam engine (similar to that which can be seen at
Prestongrange Museum, Prestonpans) was installed in 1880.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is now occupied by a small
industrial estate and a controversial pharmaceutical testing
laboratory where animals are used as part of their research.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Massacre of Tranent occured on 29th August 1797.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After many long and bloody battle in Europe the British Army was
depleted and weak hence the Militia Act of 1797 was passed. As a
response to the governments insistence on conscripting local men
into the military the people of Tranent put together a proclamation
detailing their stance :&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;1. We declare that we unanimously disapprove of the late Act of
Parliament for raising 6000 militiamen in Scotland.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2. That we will assist each other in endeavouring to repeal the
said Act.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
3. That we are peaceably disposed; and should you, in endeavouring
to execute the said Act, urge us to adopt coercive measures, we
must look upon you to be the aggressors, and as responsible to the
nation for all the consequences that may follow.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
4. Although we may be overpowered in effecting the said resolution,
and dragged from our parents, friends, and employment, to be made
soldiers of, you can infer from this what trust can be reposed in
us if ever we are called upon to disperse our fellow-countrymen, or
to oppose a foreign foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When government troops were sent into the small town to 'resolve'
the matter they were met with protesting villagers. Despite
attempts of mediation the troops charged the crowd seemingly
attacking indiscriminant villagers whether involved in the protest
or not.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt; The townsfolk were led by Jackie Crookston, beating a
drum. She was one of the 20 villagers who were slaughtered that
day. Her statue in the Civic Square was erected in 1995. It was
shortly after removed and replaced with the boy running along side
after fears about its stability&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE BE WARY OF MUGGLES. THIS IS A VERY BUSY AREA OF TOWN&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I have rated the cache a 4 for difficulty for this reason&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please bring a scribe as i just found one on the desk that I
intended to place in the cache :o)&lt;/b&gt;

 n.1.A crag; a cliff; a glen with overhanging sides.
2.A shaft in a coal pit; a hollow in a quarry.
 It would appear that The Heugh in Tranent meets both definitions. A part natural, part man-made feature - the site of ancient mine workings, there is evidence that mining in East Lothian can be traced back up to 2000 years. It is a steep sided glen running from Bridge Street down to Meadowmill. The Heugh would also form part of the route taken by the Tranent to Cockenzie Wagonway - the first railway in Scotland - transporting coal from Fleets Colliery to Cockenzie Harbour. These days the Heugh is still used regularly by walkers, joggers, dog walkers and horse riders. The route can still be walked almost uninterrupted all the way to Cockenzie Harbour. The route passes through Meadowmill, now occupied by Meadowmill Sports Centre, Bowling Club and playing fields which was once the Bankton Colliery, the large pyramid-styled hill is a bing/overburden that is now used as a view point of the Battle of Prestonpans battlefield and until recently had a dry ski-slope on the southern side.

I was not able to find out a lot about the mine so would be grateful for any information i can add to this cache page.
The area is now an early example of former mine workings being converted to another use.  A sports centre with extensive outdoor pitches and an indoor Bowling green are located on the site.
The near by pyramid styled hill is a bing or overburden from the days when mining was active.  There was at one time a dry ski-slope on the southern side of the hill.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1722 a wagonway was constructed by the York Buildings Company to transport coal from to Tranent to Cockenzie harbour for export.  The first incarnation was a very primitive affair with rails constructed of wood.
The railway took a gentle downhill route from Tranent, via the Heugh, to Cockenzie Harbour.  Each wagon, carrying a load of coal would be pullled down the slope by gravity and controlled by a brakeman to the bottom of the hill where horses would be used to pull the empty wagons back up the hill, three at a time.
Use of the railway was temporarily disrupted by the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745 when Johnny Cope's forces lined up again those of Bonnie Prince Charlie.
In 1815 the wooden rails were replaced with iron, these new wagons could carry up to two tons of coal per trip.
A lot of the route can still be followed down the Heugh and there are plans to reconstruct parts of the railway.  The area now occupied by Meadowmill Sports Centre, Bowling Club and playing fields was once a coal mine - the large pyramid-styled hill was a bing/overburden that is now used as a view point  of the Battle of Prestonpans battlefield - and until recently had a ski-slope on the southern side.

Cockenze has been the destination of the coal fields of Tranent and surrounding areas for almost as long as the coal has been mined. Originally, in the 13th century when the monks of Newbattle Abbey started up mining in Tranent a lot of the coal was transported down to Cockenzie and Prestonpans to supply the heat required to boil the water in the salt pans. 


 In 1722 the first railway in scotland was opened to improve the supply of coal to the harbour from where the coal would be shipped all over Britain to help power the industrial revolution. The harbour is used these days mainly for liesure craft but there is still an active boat builder located on the quayside. 


The harbour was rebuilt in the the 19th century, the design work being completed by one Robert Stevenson famed for his work in the development of steam locomotives. 


 In recent times the coal fired power station has been the main beneficiary of the East Lothian coal fields. Work began on the construction in 1962 with the station being formally opened in May 1968. Coal was brought in from local pits such as Monktonhall, Bilston Glen and more recently Blindwells Open Cast Mine. These days all the coal is imported from abroad, the final leg of the journey being by train to the fuel station further in land. 


 The large ring and balls near the cache are grinding equipment used to crush the coal prior to feeding the furnaces.
