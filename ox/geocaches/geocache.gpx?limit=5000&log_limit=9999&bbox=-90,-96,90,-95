            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So why aren't you at the beach.

East Matagorda Peninsula is one of the prizes of Texas.  The beach goes on for miles and if you want to avoid crowds, this is the place to come.  Even in the height of the beach season you can drive until there is no one in sight.  If you have four wheel drive, that is.  We spent a lovely day at the beach near this cache, swimming and kayaking in the surf.  So whatsa mata.  Why aren't you at the beach.

After your drive down the beach, go through the break in the dunes and follow the driving track a short way.  Then take a brief walk, being careful of the local flora, it bites.   We didn't see any fauna on the ground, but there are probably some that bite in the area.  The box is nestled on the edge of a dense thicket of  scrub trees just past the dunes.  It is attached by a cable to a branch, in hopes that the ammo can will not wash away.  When placing it we were treated to a show as some hawks took off,  circled around a few time then flew away.  

Contents are a log book, pen, a few toys, some biners, and a few Off insect repellent wipes.  Use the wipes if you need them but please don't take them away.  First to find prize is a cute little LED lantern.   

You will  need a $6 beach permit to travel here, it is good for one calender year.   The store at N28° 41.437  W95° 58.095 sells them.  The drive is uncomplicated but the cache  is some distance from the nearest road.  Please use some common sense before you commit to the long drive.

Congratulations to Team Four Paw for the FTF.

sure, but we'll let the logs decide if things seem to be leaning
that way.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are multiple ways to get to the area where the cache is. For
the most part, it's a stroll over fairly flat, sometimes mowed
land. But GZ? Well, that's another story.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is small. There is room for some tiny items, but not much.

This cache was placed for my brother-in-law, Doug (nickname). We went 4-wheeling out here before, and I had noticed there are no caches out this way. So we went 4 wheeling on Thanksgiving and found the perfect place for a cache.

There is a new subdivision being built around this area, but where the cache is located is in a utility easement. No worries about development here. You can get to it from multiple directions.

Be forewarned - along this route there are often 3 and 4 wheeler
and motorcycle muggles riding the trails, which extend from 518 to
Tuscan Lakes. There were also a considerable number of mossies out
when the cache was placed.</groundspeak:long_description>

Be sure to stop by an ABC event sometime and meet the local (and some not so local) cachers! So far they have been held at the nearby establishment, but will likely rotate to other nearby places from time to time. Although new, they have been held on the Thursday in the moth that is between the 20th and 26th of the month -- and are always a great time.
 
One strand of thorns and a couple tiny PI plants nearby, but easy enough to get to while avoiding all of that.    </groundspeak:long_description>

parking, you don't have to jump the ditch.

&lt;li&gt;Roger Murdock: We have clearance, Clarence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Captain Oveur: &lt;b&gt;Roger, Roger.&lt;/b&gt; What's our vector,
Victor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tower voice: Tower's radio clearance, over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so it's not exactly Roger, Roger. But it's close enough. If
you happened to be parked at the Rogers, it's about as close as you
can park to the cache. But note the terrain - there is an easier
way than the most direct approach.&lt;/p&gt;

It's Christmas day. I didn't get to cache today, and had to archive
my Quick Jeep-n-Grab cache due to new posts preventing Jeeping and
no trespassing signs preventing caching. So I decided to go
somewhere new and plant this one.

easy. &lt;b&gt;Please replace it EXACTLY where you found it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

It washed up during hurricane Ike and nearly caused severe damage to the nearby structure, but someone was nice enough to tie it to the bridge.  Nobody claimed it, the owner liked it, so it's there.  I had never seen one close up.

Simple, black nano. Definitely not in the most difficult
location it could be at. Can most easily be retreived from the side
that gives you the most stealth.

This did not have to be a nano. Nobody 'needs' a nano. A micro
would have done just fine. Nonetheless, an easy p-n-g with a
special pull-off designed just for this cache. Kids could do this,
but be careful about the traffic. Get them out on the safe side of
the car.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Grab your dog (and kids) and take a walk. Or take your bike and

 Sofa Dude Trials #1

There is another local series that has generated a few pages of discussion on the local Houston Geocaching Society forum. This is the start of a new series that I had in response to that discussion.

If you live in Houston, you KNOW it is HOT in the summer. So most of us tend to become Sofa Dudes (aka we don't want to cache and want to sit on the sofa where it is cool). This series aims to be the totally opposite of the previously implied caching series. There will be no bees to maneuver. There will be no physically demanding requirements to get to the cache. In general they will be fairly close from vehicle to cache. A quick way to get a smiley.

If you would like to add to this series, feel free. I just ask that you email me for a number first so that we will have an accurate count and none of the numbers will overlap.

This cache:
In case it has recently rained, then boots could come in handy (or is it footy).
Nearby parking is available.
Please be stealthy if anyone is around and protect the sanctity of the hide.
Bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Parking available at either entrance to the subdivision (or in the
median turn-arounds, if brave). There may be muggles on the sidwalk
and passing by the general location fast. Patience (just a few
minutes) will result in a zero traffic flow situation for your
caching convenience. Please wait till traffic dies before making
the grab.  And replacing.

For 35+ years I have lived in or around this area and never knew
this was here. I was scouting a place for a cache and came upon
this gravesite and spooky looking tree. I immediately developed
plans for said spooky tree, which quickly fell apart when I found
out the coords were about 10' too close to an existing cache.
&lt;br/&gt;
I normally do not like cemetery caches, but this intrigued me and
wasn't a normal cemetery. I decided to see who the Henrys were.
Google turned up the following:
&lt;br/&gt;
The grave sites are located north of Bay Area Park, Pasadena,Texas,
in wooded area. This is an old family settlement. Two graves with a
fence around it. In great condition. There are four graves in the
Henry Cemetery. The daughter of Jourdan Henry and her husband are
buried at the foot of the Henry's graves. They have no
gravestones.
&lt;br/&gt;
The Henrys were land owners of Harris County,Texas. 1902-1903,
Jordan Henry is listed with 252 acres in Seabrook, Texas. It is
said that Jourdan Henry's date of birth is 1844, though his
tombstone says 1846.
&lt;br/&gt;
During the middle of the 1800's about a dozen families of European
origin settled on the east banks of Middle Bayou. Their settlement
was called &quot;Middle Bayou&quot; or &quot;The Old French Settlement,&quot; named
after the four Louisiana French families living there for several
decades. They floated barges with their produce down the bayou to
market. The settlement had a post office and a school called the
&quot;Middle Bayou School&quot;.
&lt;br/&gt;
Additional information and photos of deeds, artifacts, and such can
be found HERE: on this website:  http://www.freewebs.com/graveyardwolf/henrycemeteryphotos.htm

&lt;b&gt;The cache:&lt;/b&gt; is a soda tube, placed at .1 miles from the
nearest cache across the street. No real room for swag, and no
prize for FTF other than glory noted eternally on the cache
page.  Recommend parking at Bay Area Park across the street and walking to the cache from there.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Congrats to &lt;u&gt;zoothornrollo&lt;/u&gt; for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;

 This semi-camo cache is in perfect view of Ellington Field (EFD),
and is a transportation themed cache. Its original contents included
airplanes (one is a TB), cars, car keychains, geocache buttons.

This will be a convenient cache for those going to the Wings
Over Houston airshow that are watching from outside the gate. It is
close to the road, and you can park in the median turn-around spots
or further down in the subdivision entrances and take a nice
stroll and pick up a few others ;). The path along the way is stroller and wheelchair
accessible, but the last few feet to the cache itself may be
unpractical (especially after rain) for a wheelchair. A stroller
should be ok.

It is large enough to hold small travel bugs and geocoins white they await the continuation of thier journeys.

This cache was started with the following items: •
Signal FTF pin • ‘TFTC’ button • Two silver

TB1P7JG – a USA bumper sticker glow-in-the-dark geocoin.

They generally keep it mowed pretty well, and there's lots of nature all around you. You can park in several different places (view in Google Earth to see options) and circle the entire ditch (there is a bridge to cross). You can even go farther down on the north side of the bridge and there is a nice pond. Might even see a gator or two! (Keep your dogs on the top of the banks.)

Cache is a camo bison tube.

There were some bunnies down here, so my greyhound had to run this way. After failing to get one, he needed a break. So I put a cache nearby. Medium sized round lock-n-lock. I added some of my new Life Is Good Pathtags and some swag to start it off. Have fun!

Please re-cover as well as possible when done.</groundspeak:long_description>

Area Paddle Series!  This is the third installment of the CLAPS series!The third installment of this series has 13 caches and runs
upstream on Armand Bayou towards its source, and is designed so
that the caches would be obtained, primarily, by paddling (kayak,
canoe, raft, etc.). Of course, there may be other ways to get to
the cache. We leave that to you. We hope that other cachers will
contribute to this paddle series or start their own in other nearby
areas.

Sound like fun? It should be! But before you attempt this series, please consider the
following:

You will get wet, and possibly soaked, doing this series.
Bring a couple gallon-sized ziplock baggies -- one for your GPSr (easy to operate in a large bag), one for your camera and phone, and one for anything else you don't want to get wet. Trap a little air in them and they float should they fall out of the boat.

Bring sunscreen!

Bring a hat - especially in summer.

Bring lots of bottled water and/or sports drinks.

Wear a PFD /Lifejacket.

Bring your camera... but don't drop it!

Bring your cell phone... just in case.

No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).

There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could
get in trouble in more ways than one.

Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.

Check out the CLAPS Challenge Cache on gc.com - GC2ANX3.

Congrats to Crankset Cacher for FTF!

They are quite smooth, unlike other erasable pens.  Well I bought some the other day just to try them out and they do erase cleanly.  Really very nice pens.  Well it turns out there is a secret as to why they erase so well, that I know now, but didn't know the morning before I set out on the water.  See, I got to this cache, paddling from Bay Area Park with my kayak Meetup group.  I made a quick stop to find the cache while the group kept going on.  So I was in a bit of  a hurry.  The coords were good and the find was easy.  After opening the tube and extracting the log I put pen to paper and nothing.  Just a blank area where my name should have been.  I tried again and then tried writing on my arm.  Nothing.  Then on closer inspection I saw just a trace of ink, clear ink.  I was in agony.  I couldn't stay with the group and go back for a new pen.

So I made an executive decision, I'd just sign the logs in clear ink.  Later I looked more closely at the package the pen came in.  It seems the ink isn't truly erasable, but the friction of the eraser heats it up and the ink turns clear.  It just so happens that the ink will also turn clear sitting on the dash of a car parked in the sun.  Cooling the ink will make it visible again and a few minutes in my freezer did in fact restore the color to the ink.

The result of this sad tale is that all the logs I singed this day along Armand Bayou are signed in invisible ink.  No really, it's all true, I swear on my 60CSX.  Just put the log in the freezer for a few seconds and you will see.  Any way, that is my tale of woe. Have mercy on this poor cacher.

Pretty area, but keep your dogs on the bank. Be gator safe. Took the dogs on a nice stroll around here recently, and saw the opportunity to place a few caches. This area was really pretty, and I saw a medium sized gator (6'-7') and a small one (maybe 3') in the pond. Lots of birds, and some turtles, too.

Enjoy the trek out here. It's normally quiet and peaceful, but there may well be joggers and other dogs walking their muggles about. They usually keep this area mowed pretty well, too.

Medium sized square lock-n-lock. I added some of my new Life Is Good Pathtags and some swag to start it off. Have fun!

Bring lots of bottled water and/or sports drinks.

Wear a PFD /Lifejacket.

Bring your camera... but don't drop it!

Bring your cell phone... just in case.

No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).

There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could
get in trouble in more ways than one.

Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.

 Sofa Dude Trials #2

There is another local series that has generated a few pages of discussion on the local Houston Geocaching Society forum. This is a continuation of my parody series that I had in response to that discussion.

If you live in Houston, you KNOW it is HOT in the summer. So most of us tend to become Sofa Dudes (aka we don't want to cache and want to sit on the sofa where it is cool). This series aims to be the totally opposite of the previously implied caching series. There will be no bees to maneuver. There will be no physically demanding requirements to get to the cache. In general they will be fairly close from vehicle to cache. A quick way to get a smiley.

If you would like to add to this series, feel free. I just ask that you email me for a number first so that we will have an accurate count and none of the numbers will overlap.

This cache:
Nearby parking is available.
Smaller than a micro.
Please be stealthy if anyone is around and protect the sanctity of the hide.
Bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

But after seeing a spider the size of a softball, with a body thicker than a golf ball, and a web big enough and strong enough to stop a bowling ball -- and my daughter -- I decided that 1) the cache had to be a certain container, and 2) it was not to be found.

So we went to the event.  And I talked to CO.   Then felt like a total doofus.  Came back and got the cache.  I can't help you with a hint on this, but I will say to stay away from the spider.  Wish I had had my camera to post a photo of the sucker.  Two of those and Andrew Zimmer has dinner.  Just sayin'.  #1,907.</groundspeak:text>

No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).

There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could
get in trouble in more ways than one.

Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.

Area Paddle Series!  This is the third installment of the CLAPS series!The third installment of this series has 13 caches and runs
upstream on Armand Bayou towards its source, and is designed so
that the caches would be obtained, primarily, by paddling (kayak,
canoe, raft, etc.). Of course, there may be other ways to get to
the cache. We leave that to you. We hope that other cachers will
contribute to this paddle series or start their own in other nearby
areas.

Sound like fun? It should be! But before you attempt this series, please consider the
following:

You will get wet, and possibly soaked, doing this series.
Bring a couple gallon-sized ziplock baggies -- one for your GPSr (easy to operate in a large bag), one for your camera and phone, and one for anything else you don't want to get wet. Trap a little air in them and they float should they fall out of the boat.

Bring sunscreen!

Bring a hat - especially in summer.

Bring lots of bottled water and/or sports drinks.

Wear a PFD /Lifejacket.

Bring your camera... but don't drop it!

Bring your cell phone... just in case.

No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).

There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could
get in trouble in more ways than one.

Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.

Check out the CLAPS Challenge Cache on gc.com - GC2ANX3.

Congrats to Crankset Cacher for FTF!

Simple cache in an area I've been wanting to put one for some time. After actually going there, there were some more difficult choices, but thought this general area was good.

Cache started off with some general swag and some supplies you can use to make your own caches, for TB purposes, etc.

FTF gets a new set of Travel Bug Dog Tags to launch a new TB!

To get here, you'll have to go across a rocky road, at least at first. So, if you don't have a lot to say in your log, at least tell me your favorite ice cream flavor. Mine is not rocky road. It's lemon custard.

Once you get near GZ (you don't have to get out of your boat), look to your East. There is a sign on a yellow pole. Subtract the number on the sign from the longitude. Then go find the cache!

Bring a hat - especially in summer.

Bring lots of bottled water and/or sports drinks.

Wear a PFD /Lifejacket.

Bring your camera... but don't drop it!

Bring your cell phone... just in case.

No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).

There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could
get in trouble in more ways than one.

Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.

Area Paddle Series!  This is the third installment of the CLAPS series!The third installment of this series has 13 caches and runs
upstream on Armand Bayou towards its source, and is designed so
that the caches would be obtained, primarily, by paddling (kayak,
canoe, raft, etc.). Of course, there may be other ways to get to
the cache. We leave that to you. We hope that other cachers will
contribute to this paddle series or start their own in other nearby
areas.

Sound like fun? It should be! But before you attempt this series, please consider the
following:

You will get wet, and possibly soaked, doing this series.
Bring a couple gallon-sized ziplock baggies -- one for your GPSr (easy to operate in a large bag), one for your camera and phone, and one for anything else you don't want to get wet. Trap a little air in them and they float should they fall out of the boat.

Bring sunscreen!

Bring a hat - especially in summer.

Bring lots of bottled water and/or sports drinks.

Wear a PFD /Lifejacket.

Bring your camera... but don't drop it!

Bring your cell phone... just in case.

No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).

There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could
get in trouble in more ways than one.

Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.

Check out the CLAPS Challenge Cache on gc.com - GC2ANX3.

Congrats to Crankset Cacher for FTF!

OK -- due to demand -- it got its name because the establishment
used to be called Acapulco, but I could not get it approved with
that name.  Establishment has changed names a few times and since died.... cache has not.  It's now something different.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The quirky comedy Brewster McCloud was shot in Houston primarily to take advantage of the newly built Astrodome.  But of course several other places were featured, one of which was the now demolished Astroworld amusement park.

Astroworld was the first and only large amusement park in Houston and was still new at the time of filming.  To the thrill seekers of today, it would have seemed to be little more than a kiddie park, but to those of us in Houston at the time, it was a blast.  

The Lost World Adventure was used in the film.  This ride featured a river boat that carried passengers along the &quot;Rio Misterio&quot; deeper and deeper into the mysterious jungle.  The sights along the river were highlighted by a mock serious commentary from the boats pilot.  One memorable event along the ride was the boat heading straight for a waterfall while the pilot claimed not to be in control.  Just at the last moment, the boat swerved, leaving the passengers dry.   Just before the boat house came into view, the pilot would announce that we were entering the scariest part of the ride, the return to civilization.  Sure its campy, but as young kids we just ate it up.  

The cache you are looking for is hidden at the back of the property that used to hold the park.   There were some great ideas for redevelopment of the land but nothing has happened for years.  The street is not very busy so cars tend to speed through and will not be expecting to see parked cars. Try parking on the intersecting street west of the cache or in the slightly closer drive on the south side of the street. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Brewster McCloud is an offbeat 1970 Robert Altman comedy shot in Houston to take advantage of the newly built Astrodome.  Nicknamed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World,&quot; the officially named Harris County Domed Stadium was the largest building in the world and the only enclosed stadium.  It was know for its scoreboard composed of thousands of light bulbs that played a western themed animation every time the Astros hit a home run or the Oilers made a touchdown.  In addition to the Dome, the score board was a technological wonder itself in 1965.

The film is a story of a boy, Brewster McCloud, who secretly lives in a unused Astrodome bomb shelter.  Brewster is played by Bud Court, fresh from a role as the PA announcer in Altman's great film M*A*S*H, and whose next effort would be the wonderful 1971 even more offbeat film Harold and Maude.  Brewster becomes involved in some assorted mischief around town leading the police to hunt for him.  While living in his hideout, he also dreams of flying and builds a set of wings, which he ultimately uses in an attempt to evade capture by the police, the movies climax, making a glorious flight around the inside of the Dome.  It's worth a viewing as an example of the zeitgeist but is hard to find. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Right Stuff is Philip Kaufman's telling of the great Tom Wolfe book about the early days of the maned space program.  The film followed Wolfe's general principal of never letting the facts get in the way of a good story.  Both film and book blur the line between fiction and non-fiction using real characters in real circumstances but adding liberally to the story to capture the spirit that the writer wants to develop.  

The film was shot all over the country, but because Houston was the center of the manned space program, many scenes were done here.  These include the bar-b-que to welcome the astronauts to Houston filmed inside the Astrodome.  This was one deviation from fact because the Dome was not yet completed so the actual event took place elsewhere.  In the movie, the events of the bar-b-que are interspersed with shots of Chuck Yeager making a failed attempt to set one last altitude record.  The events were actually 17 months apart but were symbolic of the passing of “the right stuff,” from the Yeager style seat of the pants test pilot to the engineer astronaut with advanced college degrees.

You'll get a view of the Dome looking down Stadium Drive.  Easy parking.  About as low muggle as the area gets.  You are looking for a camoed medicine bottle.  Bring your own pen.

Given the concern for the coordinates, I rechecked them and found differing amounts of error in several new readings. It just seems to depend on the direction from which you approach the cache.  Apparently the location has enough signal confusion to disrupt GPS accuracy.  Park in the lot north of the cache, walk beside the building and look for a small path between the oleanders.  

Using Google Earth produced these cords  29° 41.418'N  by  95° 24.434'W

Congratulations to Manofsteel73 and thacatfish on being FTF.

Fendmar says... &quot;you do have that container, why not put it here.&quot;  Kirbydox didn't say much but did lead the way into the area and suggesting good locations.  These guys are an influence, you decide if it is good or bad.  

Expect a little bushwacking to get to the cache location.  The ground might be a bit mushy after heavy rains (but you expect that right)</groundspeak:long_description>

From where you are standing, the cache can be found just over twice that number of meters away at a reciprocal bearing of that number. Just like in the old days accuracy will be within about 20 meters.

There are a couple places nearby to park but still be prepared to walk a bit, between a half mile to a mile depending where you park.

&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log -
pencil only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a
wonderful CITO opportunity. Please pick up any trash or refuse on
your way out and do your best to re-hide the cache in the original
configuration. Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
area of Baytown began to be settled as early as 1822. One of its
earliest residents was Nathaniel Lynch, who set up a ferry crossing
at the junction of the San Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou. The
ferry service that he started is still in operation today, now
known as the Lynchburg Ferry. Other early residents of Baytown
include William Scott, one of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three
Hundred, and Ashbel Smith, who owned a plantation in the area. The
city now known as Baytown was originally three separate towns. The
first of these was Goose Creek, named for the bayou of the same
name where Canadian Geese wintered and whose name is still
reflected in the area's Goose Creek CISD, whose establishment dates
back to before 1850. With the discovery of the Goose Creek Oil
Field, the rival communities of Pelly in the late 1910s, and East
Baytown in the early 1920s, developed as early boom-towns. The
&quot;East&quot; in East Baytown was later dropped because it was west of
Goose Creek. Serious talk of merging the three cities began shortly
after World War I, but the community of Baytown was opposed to this
idea. However, in 1947, the three cities finally agreed to
consolidate. The citizens settled on the name Baytown for the new
combined city. Baytown as it is known today was officially founded
January 24, 1948. In 1916, the Humble Oil &amp; Refining Company,
founded by one-time Texas governor Ross S. Sterling and his
associates, in developing the Goose Creek Oil Field, built the
first offshore drilling operation in Texas and the second in the
United States. The company later built the Baytown Refinery, which
would become one of the largest Exxon Refineries in the world.
Since then, many other refineries have been built in the area.
Exxon-Mobil is still one of the major employers in the city and now
runs over ten plants in the area. Steel manufacturing in Baytown
began in 1970 when United States Steel opened the Texas Works near
the city. The 48 inch seamless pipe used in the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System was produced at the facility's pipe mill. The plant
was officially closed in July 1986 (never reopening after a
nationwide strike against the company), due to a poor economic
climate and the decline of American steel in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

Rice Ave and Chimney Rock.

This forest offers the busy urban dweller a rare place of solitude in the midst of the chaos of modern life. A touch of nature in an area passed by hundreds of thousands of people yet known to only a few. Like other forests in the region it is composed mostly of pine and oak trees but contains many other varieties of trees, shrubs and flowering plants.

The wild life reflects the nature of the urban setting. I could hear the sounds of young children playing on the other side of the wall that separates the forest from nearby homes. Within the forest there was ample evidence of nesting by a number of that most abundant of urban wildlife, homo nondomus. As always when caching, use your best judgment.

The container has a log book and room to hold small trade items and pathtags.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This series is designed to emphasize some of the lesser known young forests in the Houston area. The urban micro forests planted in the green spaces created by modern development. This micro forest covers a one half mile strip of new growth abutting the Southwest Freeway between S. Rice Ave and Chimney Rock.

This forest offers the busy urban dweller a rare place of solitude in the midst of the chaos of modern life. A touch of nature in an area passed by hundreds of thousands of people yet known to only a few. Like other forests in the region it is composed mostly of pine and oak trees but contains many other varieties of trees, shrubs and flowering plants.

The wild life reflects the nature of the urban setting. I could hear the sounds of young children playing on the other side of the wall that separates the forest from nearby homes. Within the forest there was ample evidence of nesting by a number of that most abundant of urban wildlife, homo nondomus. As always when caching, use your best judgment.

The container has a log book and room to hold small trade items and pathtags.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache commemorates an eminently forgettable coming of age movie filmed in Houston.  The main claim to fame of [i]My Best Friend Is a Vampire[/i] is that it stared the young Robert Sean Leonard as a cute, lovable and romantically awkward teen who becomes a vampire.  Leonard is better known as the cute, lovable and romantically awkward Dr. James Wilson on the TV series [i]House MD.[/i]  While not really a bad movie as vampire comedies go, it isn’t particularly funny either.  It was aimed at a target market of not to discerning teens in 1987 so it is full of cliches, 20 year old cultural stereotypes and predictable plot lines.  Still it was better than [i]Twilight[/i].

Most of the movie was filmed indoors. The screen time shot outdoors is largely car chases, usually the result of a bumbling pair of vampire hunters mistakenly trying to kill the wrong person.  Several chases occur downtown that intentionally highlight the modern sculpture in the plazas outside the buildings, seen as the cars screech around the corners.  Of course one of these turns goes awry resulting  in the destruction of a faux sculpture.  

The placement of the cache is the result of a car chase that leaves downtown along Allen Parkway and disappears after a curve in the road just past Waugh Drive.  As a police radio announces the chase on Allen Parkway the cars turn up racing down Richmond Avenue some 8 miles away.  The chase ended in a humorously improbable crash in front of this newly developed shopping center, still mostly empty.  The camera angles assure you get a picture of the signs for the Safeway that used to be here and for the Stop and Go, now a Valero, showing a price of $0.58 for a gallon of gas.  However, being a teen movie, the action picked up from there when the protagonist and his girlfriend steal a police car. It wouldn't really be a spoiler to tell what happened next, because it was quite obvious to anyone watching the film, but from this point I just used the fast forward to get to the end.    

The movie is available as an instant watch from Netflix if you have a fondness for campy films.  Just don't waste one of your selections to rent the disk.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">[i]FM[/i] tells the story of a Los Angeles radio station that has become popular because of the great music it plays.  All is well until the corporate minions come in to strip the station of its autonomy and make even greater profits by playing more commercials, including those annoying &quot;Join the Army&quot; ditties.  The station manager publicly resigns, and the DJ's rebel, calling on the listeners to help save the station from the evil corporate takeover.  The ensuing event result in a riot in front of the station offices to the the sounds of Queen's [i]We Will Rock You[/i], which is only quelled when an old guy in a limo pulls in to announce that the corporation has heard its listeners and will give them what they want.  

The scenario of a great radio station going bad was familiar to those of us in college at the time.  Radio stations were always remaking themselves to hold a certain demographic segment.  This became even more heightened as popular music stations were increasing in number while disco and other non rock and roll styles of music becoming more prominent.  This movie was something of a precursor to the Clear Channel take over of radio that started 20 year later.  Still as a movie [i]FM[/i] was pretty bland.  The acting was dull and the deus ex machina ending uninspiring.

While the movie was set in Los Angeles, they filmed one scene at a Linda Ronstadt concert in Houston at the former Summit. The great concert site suffered a series of corporate takeovers of its own, first when naming rights were sold and it was renamed the Compact Center.  Later the Toyota Center opened downtown, replacing it as the city's main sports and concert venue. Then it became Lakewood Church and the corporate headquarters of Joel Olsteen Ministries.    For those of us that came of age going to concerts  in the seventies and early eighties, it will always be the Summit.  The sounds of ZZ Top, The Who and The Grateful Dead and the hundreds of other bands that played there will echo between those walls forever.

The cache is placed across the street from the west side of the building.  This side is where the tour buses would drive in to deliver the performers. The ticket booth was at the entrance level.  The west face is also the least changed by the church remodeling.

Congratulations to Parker Plus for being first to find.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache was placed to highlight the artwork next to the building, a large sculpture of a saxophone partially constructed from car body parts belonging to old Volkswagen Beetles.  The building originally housed “Billy Blues,” one outlet of a now defunct chain of theme restaurants that featured live music.  The restaurants motto was “Bar-B-Que all day, cook all night.” The sculpture caused some controversy when it was installed.  The City of Houston viewed it as an unlicensed sign and wanted the restaurant to comply with city sign codes, which the sculpture could not.  The restaurant successfully claimed that it was art and not regulated by the city ordinances, allowing it to be kept in place.  However you look at it, the art did make for a good advertisement for Billy Blues.  Update: The building has been renovated and is now &quot;The Horn&quot; club, bringing a great deal of traffic to the parking lot.  Please use discretion when there is activity in the area.

The cache is a park and grab away from the sax and the building.  In fact you could retrieve it without leaving your car, if you parked just right.  The new container is a bison tube.  

Congratulations to Dyfen on the first to find.

Looking back maybe that wasnt so safe but its still a nice area and is very quiet if you stay out of the bayou! I'm a photographer now and plan to do some shots down here one day. Look for my 35mm canister and remember when you used to use film, did you like taking pics as a kid? Take a pic now if you can at the location! I'd love to see! Something special for ftf.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is not much to say about this movie as it is in post production as of the publishing of the cache. 

[i]The Tree of Life[/i] stars Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Joanna Going, Fiona Shaw, and Jessica Chastain. Filmed at locations all over the state and employing the building at 1100 Louisiana in Houston.  The area around the building is saturated with caches, so I chose a more remote location that has a good view of the building.  If you look north from here you can see the prominent pink granite building featuring the &quot;cut away&quot; bays in the sides.  The 55 story Skidmore, Owens and Merrill skyscraper stands handsomely next to the green glass Wells Fargo building.  The cutaway side made room for a rather stark bank lobby and an outdoor plaza.  Originally built by that great shaper  of the Houston skyline, Hines  Interests, to house First International bank. It has gone through a number of names as the economy has changed and is now called Enterprise Plaza after the major tenant, Enterprise Product Partners. The ultra modern former bank lobby has been converted into a home for the PageSoutherlandPage architectural firm and serves as the location where Penn's character works.

If you have a few minutes, go the few extra blocks to get a closer look.  It is one of the more interesting and innovative buildings among the many great contributions that Hines made to the city skyline during the boom years.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Set Up
Once upon a time there was a handsome young playboy of a fireman in Houston named Greg (Jim Hutton). The leader of his company is a gruff old guy named Chance (John Wayne), who has taken the younger man under his wing and is grooming Greg for leadership. Greg thinks of Chance as a father figure. They are called to a fire where Chance is badly hurt and Greg gets the task of persuading Chance's estranged daughter, Tish (Katherine Ross), to come see her father. 

Boy Meets Girl and They Have a Fight
Greg hops into the company jet and takes off for Jackson Hole, where Tish is staying in her vacation home. These are no ordinary firefighters, you see, these are Hellfighters, men who extinguish burning oil wells. Tish reluctantly agrees to come to Houston and shows little emotion for her gravely injured father. At the same time, Greg is feeling the situation acutely, and lashes out at Tish for her lack of feeling.  At this point everyone who has read [i]Pride and Prejudice[/i] knows that Greg and Tish will get married, it is just a matter of how they will overcome their initial dislike for each other. 

A Family Reunites 
They arrive and meet Madelyn, Tish's mother and Chances' former wife. While we are waiting to see if Chance will live, (like anyone could kill off John Wayne in a movie) we learn that Madelyn still loves Chance. In the back story it turns out after Tish's birth, Madelyn decided she could not live with the dangers inherent in wild well firefighting, the exact risks that Chance thrives on. They agreed to a divorce and Madelyn raised Tish on her own, explaining Chance's crusty behavior. 

Love as Hot as a Wild Well Fire
Chance and Madelyn have never really moved on from their divorce and are still in love. Since this is John Wayne, you know he will get his girl.  It also turns out that Greg is pretty much like Chance, thriving on risk and adventure while Tish is like her mother and attracted to just that kind of man. Showing the same impulsiveness as her parents, Tish and Greg marry as quickly as they can get Chance out of the hospital. Can they live happily ever after? Can Tish avoid the worry and loneliness that drove her parents apart? More importantly, does the audience really care? 

Things Can Only Get Worse
Unfortunately by this time no one really does care. Tish's main job from this point is to follow her husband to unconvincingly filmed &quot;exotic&quot; and dangerous locations. She is given nothing better to do than stand around, look uncomfortable and try to stay out of the way while the men tell her she should be at home. Then as if to prove a point, the Communist guerrillas attack on cue. 

Poor Katherine Ross, after sparkling as Elaine Robinson in [i]The Graduate[/i] with Dustin Hoffman, she is dumped into this preposterous role opposite the dull Jim Hutton. [i]The Hellfighters[/i] embodies what [i]The Graduate[/i] had so successfully satirized just one year before. 

The container is a magnetic key holder placed on a busy downtown street. The spot is near the the building that hosted board meetings for an oil company featured in the film. That building is a few blocks west at 550 Jefferson but this intersection provided a better view. From this location, if you cross Louisiana Street and look north east up the street, you will see two of the building that were prominently visible from the board room. The easy to recognize Humble Oil building (now ExxonMobil) is partly obscured to your right. Several blocks up Louisiana to Polk Street is the mostly obscured former Sheraton Lincoln Hotel. The old building is not much to see as it has been abandoned for years. Not really visible from behind the old Sheraton is the Tenneco (El Paso) building. Both the ExxonMobil and El Paso buildings house the successors to the companies resident there when [i]The Hellfighters[/i] was made in 1968. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The location of this cache is near the site for building used in [i]The Hellfighters[/i] as the headquarters of the Buckman Company.  The movie showed some potential as a John Wayne action film but wound up being a dull potboiler. The story is so bland it should have been called [i]The Heckfighters.[/i]  For the full review see [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=69770b2b-e0e0-4ae5-b640-1feebd9f6360]On Location: Hell Fighters (Downtown Houston)[/url]

The original building is no longer standing and I located the approximate site by matching up the locations of several skyscrapers downtown.  The cache is a little south of the building site because of the proximity of other caches.  Park on Sabine Street and you will get the great view of downtown that made this attractive as a film location, although there are many more buildings that were there in 1968.  You can easily see the two of the three prominent structures from the film, the old Humble Oil building (now ExxonMobil) and the former Houston Lighting and Power headquarters (Houston Public Works)  The Tenneco building (El Paso Corp) is hidden by the green glass walled Wells Fargo Bank.

The El Paso Building is a creation of one of the most prolific designers of skyscrapers in world, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.  It is an &quot;exoskeleton&quot; style with the frame sitting several feet outside the windows with ledges for each floor.  This design was used in many buildings to provided shade to the long banks of windows.  Some years later mirrored glass came into use and the curtain wall became more popular, leaving these buildings as markers for the time they were built.  The El Paso building is a handsome example of the style.

You are looking for a camoed bison tube on Sabine Street near Allen Parkway.  Like many urban locations, this area has plenty of muggles.  With a little stealth you should be able to sign the log without attracting attention.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Paris, Texas is a 1984 film by German director Wim Wenders, with a script by the great Sam Sheppard, that tells the story of a disaffected loner seeking to reclaim something of the family he left behind.  It is notable for its visual depiction of the Texas landscape and climate mostly seen though the journey of the protagonist, Travis Henderson.  Paris, Texas, itself is never shown, even the photo that is used to represent the town was really taken in some other location.

The film was widely acclaimed and won the Palme d'Ore and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.  Roger Ebert lists it in his reviews of Great Films.  It stars the amazingly beautiful Nastassja Kinski as Jane and the handsomely homely Harry Deans Stanton as her husband, Travis.  In the back story, their brief marriage produced a son, Hunter, but Travis had become increasingly alienated from the  happiness offered him by a family and sinks into jealousy and rage before the despair at what he has become drives him away.  Hunter becomes a victim of this collapsing family and goes to live with Travis' brother in California.  

The story starts some years later when Travis is found mute, wandering through Texas.  He is trying to get to Paris, Texas, his former home, to find who he is.  After being rescued, Travis is taken by his brother to California where he is reunited with his son.  Somewhat recovered, Travis then travels to Houston with Hunter and to find Jane.  She works siting behind a glass panel while male patrons talk to her from a dark booth separated by a glass window.  Travis enters the booth and starts to tell her a story of a man who mistrusts and mistreats his beautiful young bride.   This confuses her until she realizes it is her story at which time she also realizes who must be behind the glass.  Then Travis tells her of his reason for being there.  I'll stop at this point rather than spoil the ending.  The film is available from Netflix and is well worth watching.  

The film employed various outdoor locations in downtown Houston, including the former Texas Commerce Bank (now JP Morgan Chase) drive-in bank branch at 212 Milam near where the cache is placed.  Other buildings include the DoubleTree Hotel at 400 Dallas and a parking garage at 1100 Smith.

Wow, that's sure a nice church. At 1919 Decatur, you'll be in front of the Tabernacle Baptist Church. First organized in 1891, then rebuilt in 1929, this church is neighborhood favorite spot. 
Across the street are some more examples of the beautifully restored Victorian era homes. Enjoy!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lynchburg Ferry&lt;/b&gt; is
a ferry across the Houston Ship Channel in the U.S. state of Texas,
connecting Crosby-Lynchburg Road in Lynchburg to the north with the
former State Highway 134 and San Jacinto Battleground State
Historic Site in La Porte to the south. The 1,080 feet (330 m)
crossing is the oldest operating ferry service within the state of
Texas. It carries automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians for free.
Harris County has operated the ferry continuously since 1888.
Ferries depart daily approximately every 5-10 minutes, beginning at
4:30 a.m. (04:30) and operate through 8:15 p.m. (20:15) and have a
maximum capacity of 12 vehicles. The service averages between
approximately 1,500-2,000 vehicles per day. The service has two
ships in its fleet, both completed in 1964 by the Todd Shipyard.
The ferries are named in honor of former the Texas governors
William P. Hobby and Ross S. Sterling. A third ferry with a
capacity of 9 vehicles dating from 1937 is available on standby if
needed.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed in honor of [i]Sugar Hill,[/i] a 1974 low budget blaxploitation horror movie. Filmed in Houston but set in an unnamed place in Louisiana, the only easily identified landmark was the Heights Library a block or so north of the cache.  The location was used with almost no attempt at plausibility as the Voodoo Museum and Research Library.

Instead of focusing the most controversial stereotypes of a genre that frequently portrays urban blacks as pimps and drug dealers, [i]Sugar Hill[/i] presents blacks as hard workers fighting white oppression.  Filmed on a low budget with a cast of TV character actors and unknowns, the acting was is reminiscent of TV dramas of the period, stiff and overly serious.  The blaxploitation plotline, stereotyped characters, stilted scriptwriting and wooden TV style acting sets this movie completely to its time with no hope of transcendence.   

The opening scene anchors the plotline and reveals the low budget production values.  A black guy owns a successful nightclub where black entertainers put on a Voodoo show for the white patrons.  A white mafia boss wants to buy the club but the owner won’t sell, so the boss sends in his henchmen to beat the owner to death.  The racial theme is made clear through the thugs’ vile jeers shouted at the owner as they kick him while he is on the ground.  The low budget meant there was no dummy to use as a stand in, so the actors could be seen kicking the pavement next to the guy.

The owner’s girlfriend Diana Hill, a woman so sweet she is known as “Sugar” now owns the club. The murder transforms her to a woman with a single minded focus on revenge.  Helpless on her own, she seeks out her ancient grandmother in a rundown mansion in the swamp, who just happens to be a Voodoo Priestess.  Together they walk deeper into the swamp to an old slave cemetery where Sugar’s passion for revenge is sufficient to call the Voodoo Lord of the Dead.  He gleefully agrees to use his power to exact her revenge in exchange for Sugar’s promise of her soul when all the whites are dead.  Then on cue, his army of slave zombies rise from their graves, machetes in hand. 

From here the audience is treated to each thug dying in a uniquely horrible way measured to the level of his racism. The gruesome deaths are mostly off camera to save expenses.  In the end the gang boss, who is not particularly racist, gets the easiest treatment by getting pulled down into the swamp to drown. The worst punishment goes to the bosses jealous, vengeful and hatefully racist moll when she is taken alive by the Lord of the Dead into the underworld, to serve him forever.  The moll also serves as temporary payment for Sugar’s debt of her own soul.  With the revenge complete, Sugar can now get on with her life.   

Any lover of campy movies will have to put [i]Sugar Hill[/i] high on the must see list.  It is available from Netflix instant view.

Today, the weather was beautiful. I had just been getting an FTF with MOS and georeynosos, and she volunteered to help me find this cache because it was hard to find. We made the short walk over, and she &quot;helped&quot; me find the cache. I know that I would have never have found it without her help.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bison tube only, so BYOP. Nestled along the piney hardwoods of Jesse H. Jones Park &amp; Nature Center's Cypress Overlook Trail. Access through front gate only during regular park hours (park closes at 5 p.m. in Dec. and Jan., at 6 p.m. in Nov. and Feb., and at 7 p.m. Mar. to Oct.). Enjoy the park's 7 miles of trails, interpretive nature center (open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily), playground, picnic tables, boardwalks, white sand beaches...the list goes on, so make a day of it!

Difficulty is a 2.5 due to the fact that the coordinates jump around a bit under the forest canopy. The abrupt downslope at the park entrance brings you into a floodplain forest; in fact, the nature center building is on some of the highest ground in the park, yet it was still inundated by a flood in 1994! Proceed north along the Canoe Launch Trail, stopping for a moment at the Cypress Overlook pond. The resident turtles have already sensed your approach, and have been moving toward the overlook deck to greet you for a snack, hoping you have acquired turtle food at the Nature Center. The second entrance to the Cypress Overlook Trail will lead you in the correct direction. Along the way, take note of the cypress trees and their characteristic 'knees' which line the banks of the pond. Small alligators sometimes take up residence here for brief periods. Near the west end of the pond, you will enter the domain of an old and venerable magnolia tree. This species has reportedly existed in North America for 95 million years. Before the existence of bees, pollination was thought to have been accomplished by beetles. Examine this 'aristocrat' of trees. Note the resurrection fern on the trunk, with leaves that are withered and brown during dry periods, and then reborn to lush green after a rain. Examine the trunk's horizontal woodpecker holes, indicating a Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker of yore. The tiny holes yielded sap, which attracted insects, and then enlarged as the trunk enlarged. Huge four-petaled white blossoms adorn the magnolia's canopy, yet are seldom seen fromthe ground. Birds seek the bright red seeds when they are ripe. Each bloom and seed pod creates a miniature biosphere for myriad insects and other invertebrates. Whether or not you find the cache, stop for a moment and look around if the mosquitoes allow. Resist the urge for a quick 'Grab and Go.' Reflect briefly on the mysteries of this wonderful land. Attach this part of the park to your DNA. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache placed in memory of the severe forest fire that occurred here on June 17, 2011. Log and pens, and a bit of swag and lots of extra HoustonHerp pens to get the ball rolling.

This area was devastated by a severe forest fire on June 17, 2011. The fire was so dangerous that the Texas Forest Service was called in to assist numerous area fire departments who responded to the blaze. Since this fire was less than 0.3 miles from my house, it gave my family and I quite a scare; in fact, during the afternoon, we even had a TANKER plane dropping flame retardant on the fire! Fortunately, no buildings were damaged and no one was injured.

If you are standing at GZ and look to the northwest, you will see one of the areas that was hardest hit; scorched stumps and trees are all that's left of a once-thriving forest. However, this is still a living ecosystem, and new herbaceous plants, then shrubs, and finally trees, will slowly repopulate the area. If you visit this cache, I hope you will take the time to take a photo of the area to the northwest. It would be great to post pictures as time goes by to show how this once forested area recovers from the great 'Birnamwood Burn of June 17, 2011'.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed in the original Edgewood Cemetery. It was lost and abandoned for many years and recently was deeded back to the city. Very little work has been done here and many of the headstones are lost.

Insect repellent might be a good idea at this one.

The cache is not completely under the bridge. It is a &quot;Cell Phone Dry Box&quot; and has small swag and a log.  

***Please bring something to write with as there is a log sheet but nothing to write with in the cache.***

Please be careful when looking for the cache, as there is definitely poison ivy and possibly snakes.

The bridge is now closed to traffic.  You are able to access the cache without walking clear out onto the bridge.  Little children actually might have trouble walking on the bridge, it has a very open grid and their feet might slip in one of the holes.

Keep an eye on little children so they don't fall off the bridge. The cache is not meant to be hard to find, it is meant to be a fun family cache, but please keep safety in mind!  I'd be very cautious about taking little kids clear out onto the bridge. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Southeast corner. This cache has a $5 gift card to Starbucks in it.  I am only posting gift card info on OX! Please take it if you find it and let me know so I can remove this.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I thought we would drive on through to The Old Bixby bridge, but this bridge is closed so we had to turn back here and find another route.  The attaching devices have come unglued.  Neat old bridge, but it looks like it's days are numbered.  TNLN, Signed Log.</groundspeak:text>

****No pencil or pen is in the dry box!!!  Bring something to write with!****

This is an old bridge blocked with wooden barrier posts. The main road used to go to the bridge, but it bypasses it now and the old road is a good place to park on the northside .

Please be on the look out for possible broken beer bottles. Also, watch out for snakes, spiders, poison ivy. Hopefully you'll see some cool wildlife, like tarantulas and lizards.

Watch young children carefully...don't let them fall off the bridge!

I think it would be difficult to get a wheelchair or stroller onto the bridge, due to the barrier posts. 

This is not meant to be a difficult cache to find. No need to do anything dangerous, like climbing over the bridge rails!!

Here is a picture of the bridge.  Last time I was out there, it had been cleared off considerably.  There were also less beer bottles, which tells me that may be why they cleared it!

The Coordinates seemed off by about 40'.  Could be from the origional hide.  SL, left a Pathtag and grabbed the drink card.  Thank you!</groundspeak:text>

THEM.***

&lt;br/&gt;

                          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very easy family-oriented cache. Cache contains lots of goodies that will change frequently. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; This cache is owned by Riverview Baptist Church and is located on church property.  Some items in the cache are simply letting you know what our church has going on, but most of the swag is family-oriented fun stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
Terrain is very easy to navigate on foot.  The only difficulty is there are cacti and stickers.  These can be avoided for the most part but do not wear sandals or flip-flops!  Watch for sandy areas to step on.  Toddlers should be carried so they don't trip and fall into a sticker or cactus, but there is a relatively sticker-free area near the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Efforts will be made to clear a way through the stickers sometime in the future when it's not 100+ degrees outside!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Strollers and wheelchairs would have a very hard time due to the soil being so sandy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Area is monitored at night by law enforcement.  Please don't &lt;br/&gt;
try to access cache after dark.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This cache is often gone through and items stolen. The one thing the person doing the stealing never takes is the Bible.  Inside the Bible is a gift card from Riverview.  Please take it and let me know when you do so I can replace it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Elk City State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


The area has many habitat types, which support a variety of wildlife.  Dominant vegetation consists of big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass and switchgrass and other plants associated with the bluestem prairie.  A prominent feature of the landscape is the precipitous rock bluff of limestone known as Table Mound.  Wind and erosion have created many scenic vistas on the limestone bluffs along the northern border of the park.  In addition, autumn brings an abundance of colors to the native trees along the bluff.


The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

&lt;p&gt;The characteristic rocks in the Chautauqua Hills are the thick
sandstones that cap the hills and are exposed along creek and river
valleys. Sandstone, which is made up largely of quartz grains
cemented together by calcium carbonate, iron oxide, or silica, is a
common sedimentary rock. In eastern Kansas, sandstone is often
interbedded with shale and limestone. It also occurs as channel
deposits, cutting through older deposits of shale and
limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sandstones capping the Chautauqua Hills are the Tonganoxie
Sandstone Member of the Stranger Formation and Ireland Sandstone
Member of the Lawrence Formation. Both are thick rock formations,
the remains of deposits that filled a large, ancient river valley
during the Pennsylvanian Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sandstones are marked by ridges and troughs that look like
the ripples you'd see in loose sand in a stream, shallow lake, sea,
or sand dune. By studying ripple marks preserved in sandstone and
comparing them with similar marks found in today's sand, geologists
can make shrewd assumptions about what the environment was like
when these sandstones were deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the area you will see numerous sandstone outcroppings
that are a unique feature here in Kansas and it gives one a feeling
of being in the Ozarks instead of being in Kansas. Marker # 2 along
the trail is at one such outcropping and is the location of the
earthcache coordinates listed above. There are a total of 15
markers along the trail and you will need to bring a canoe or
kayak, or inquire at the front gate about using one of the 5 kayaks
the state park has just for those that want to paddle the water
trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging requirements, email all answers to the email on my
profile page:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What is the blue marker # 2 attached to at the cache
location. Is this a geologic feature, or biologic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Estimate the size of the Sandstone outcropping near marker #
2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What is marker # 6 attached to, is this geologic or
biologic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Take an elevation reading at the cache location and send me
the reading you get. I will use this to monitor lake level
differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy and be safe paddling on the lake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;102HE4Z - Marker 10&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.974 W 095° 55.730&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;112HE4Z - Marker 11&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.922 W 095° 55.811&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;122HE4Z - Marker 12&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.898 W 095° 55.884&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;132HE4Z - Marker 13&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.828 W 095° 55.966&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;142HE4Z - Marker 14&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.714 W 095° 56.156&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;152HE4Z - Marker 15&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.637 W 095° 56.142&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M12HE4Z - Marker 1&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.503 W 095° 56.321&lt;br/&gt;Boat Ramp - launching point&lt;br/&gt;M22HE4Z - Marker 2&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.435 W 095° 56.279&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M32HE4Z - Marker 3&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.504 W 095° 56.146&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M42HE4Z - Marker 4&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.607 W 095° 56.082&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M52HE4Z - Marker 5&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.642 W 095° 56.045&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M62HE4Z - Marker 6&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.718 W 095° 56.038&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M72HE4Z - Marker 7&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.761 W 095° 55.943&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M82HE4Z - Marker 8&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.904 W 095° 55.810&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M92HE4Z - Marker 9&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 46.963 W 095° 55.713</groundspeak:long_description>

This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Cross Timbers State Park is located in the gently rolling hills of the Verdigris River Valley in southeast Kansas.  Comprising 1,075 acres in the northern reaches of the physiographic region known to early pioneers as the Cross Timbers, this park provides numerous access points to the 2,800-acre Toronto Reservoir.  The park is located 12 miles west of Yates Center in Woodson County.  This region was a favored hunting and camping ground of Native Americans of the Osage Nation.  The forested flood plains, surrounded by terraces of prairie and hills of oak savannah, provide visitors an opportunity to immerse themselves in some of the most diverse flora and fauna in Kansas.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Chautauqua Hills are a sandstone-capped rolling upland that
extends into the Osage Cuestas from the southern Kansas border.
Approximately 10 miles wide, these hills extend as far north as
Yates Center in Woodson County. Small patches of similar terrain
can be found as far north as Leavenworth County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chautauqua Hills formed primarily in the thick sandstones of
the Douglas Group. During the Pennsylvanian Period, about 286
million to 320 million years ago, rivers and streams flowed into
the sea in this area. Sand and other sediments collected in the
estuaries and at the mouths of the rivers in deltas. Over time, the
sediments were buried and compacted--the sands became sandstone and
the muds became shale. Over millions of years, uplift and erosion
exposed the sandstone and shale at the earth's surface. Further
erosion has dissected the area into a series of low hills, capped
by more resistant sandstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of rock outcrops in this region, the hills are generally
not cultivated but are used instead for pasture. The Verdigris,
Fall, and Elk rivers cross the area in narrow valleys walled by
sandstone bluffs. Topographic relief in the region is never more
than 250 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the hills are covered by stands of black jack oaks,
scrub oaks, and other hardwood species. This mix of medium-tall
grasslands and scattered stands of deciduous trees is called the
Cross Timbers by scientists who map vegetation. In Kansas, the
extent of the Cross Timbers is almost identical to the extent of
the Chautauqua Hills physiographic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging requirements, email me the answers to the
following:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Find the information board and tell me what percent of the
old growth forest is made up of trees that are older than 250
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Give a reason why the geology of the area would keep the
trees from growing as big as other old growth forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Take an elevation reading at the coordinates and tell me what
direction you are facing while reading the information board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting my earthcache and happy hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to madmallard on the First to Find.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The trail is built upon a railroad Right-of Way which was the first north -south rail line in Kansas.  The rail line was constructed in the1860's.  The trail is a hard packed limestone screening surface in rural areas. Portions of the trail are asphalted through Garnett and Ottawa.  The trail averages a minimum of 8 feet wide.  The grades are moderate and follow original railroad grades.

Dedicated in 1975, 1500-acre Clinton State Park is located on the northeast shore of Clinton Reservoir. The balance between recreation areas and natural areas within the park is carefully managed.  Wildflowers and prairie grasses divide the turf and then blend gracefully into the timberline.  Native wildlife is abundant and easily viewed along park roadways.  Whitetail deer, turkeys, waterfowl and songbirds add a rich texture to the sightseeing experience.  As the surrounding area becomes more urbanized the importance of the park and the experiences it provides becomes ever more critical in meeting that “need to escape”. 

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name!

The scenic river trail is my favorite route back to Lawrence after seeing my children in Topeka. This cache is named for my son Aidan who always loves a good treasure hunt!

We were kind enough to place it close to a pulloff spot, so there is a spot to park and grab. There is a bit of a dropoff, so be careful, and don't fall down onto the railroad tracks or you went too far. There are few thorns so watch out.

bike trails, 25 miles of horse trails, and a 1.5-mile nature trail.  A more detailed brochure highlighting
these trails is available by contacting the park office. Combined with the 12,500-acre reservoir and nearby 11,000-acre wildlife area, this state park is well situated to accommodate any outdoor preference.

 Legend has has it, that there are 13 Crystal skulls created by the ancient people of the world.  All 13 will come together when mankind most needs them.  But that's not going to happen.  The 6 crystal skulls that are in museums and private collections today are all fakes!  I have found all 13 of the REAL CRYSTAL SKULLS, but have left them hidden until mankind is ready for them to be revealed.  This is the first of the Crystal Skulls!

No story behind this one, I've played little golf in my life.  But this cache brings you a little closer to the course near my home.  This cache isn't quite on the golf course, but you can watch golfers tee off while you're searching for it.

 I once said that I would never hide a micro...This was my only one(heh heh heh, it's not a micro anymore!).  The other night I picked up a GeoCoin, with honorable intentions of sending it on it's merry way.  I went to it's page, read it's goal...&quot;NOOOOOOOOOO!!!&quot;  It's goal is to be hidden in a NEW MICRO!!! I was tempted to quietly put it back in school cache (where someone dropped it without logging it, the cowards!), but decided it needed to be on it's way, planting it's evil micro seeds everywhere.  Should be easy for all of you micro hunters to find, so you're not getting any hints (except maybe the name).  FTF prize is an evil Nano.  The evil micro-spawning geocoin is in there too.  (Now that the coin is gone, I've traded this one out for, well, you'll just have to come and see...Hmmmmm [:)])

 Congratulations to Ladycache for the First to Find!

I've upped the difficulty slightly, hint still applies, and the cache is still in the same place.  Please use extreme Stealth, as the young muggles WILL see you looking for this one if they are present (I've got more containers if they snitch a couple).

Small items and a log, and I put a pen in it now.

Nearby is a place to have a cookout, or to enjoy a &quot;campfire.&quot;  They've really made some nice improvements to this so-called &quot;ditch park&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

 Ever get to a cache location, only to discover that there's no cache there?  That it was a phantom location just used to post the cache? Maybe is was the starting point of a mystery or a Wherigo cache?

Every time you put a phantom cache out there, a psychic bond is created between the geoforce and the area.  If the geoforce becomes strong enough in that area, strange containers begin showing up!

If Your cache's physical location is not within 600 feet of the posted coordinates, the geoforce may create a container nearby.  Being that it IS a geoforce created container, you should expect a container that the geoforce is familiar with.

 On Oct. 2, 1881, a small group of men met in the basement of St. Mary’s Church on Hillhouse Avenue in New Haven, Connecticut. Called together by their 29-year-old parish priest, Father Michael J. McGivney, these men formed a fraternal society that would one day become the world’s largest Catholic family fraternal service organization.

They sought strength in solidarity, and security through unity of purpose and devotion to a holy cause: they vowed to be defenders of their country, their families and their faith.

These men were bound together by the ideal of Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of the Americas, the one whose hand brought Christianity to the New World. Their efforts came to fruition with the incorporation of the Knights of Columbus on March 29, 1882.

They were Knights of Columbus.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Long before George Washington Carver invented peanut butter (much to the delight of pretty much everyone!), the Ancients of Bellevue must have discovered that if you mashed up these wonderful nuts, they tasted good on bread.  We (the Kid and I) uncovered proof of their obsession with this stuff.  Of course, we left the ancient artifact exactly where we found it.

 In our Archeologic studies, The Kid, Beautiful Lady, and I have found lots of ancient artifacts (-sigh-,most of them are furnature in my living room). This Crystal Skull was discovered and catalogued, then left exactly where it was found, to be studied by future generations. We also uncovered a legend that we believe is tied to this amazing artifact. 

Congratulations to cache wyz on the First To Find!

The Story of Ahmou

In the Ancient times, there was a stone cutter known for his beautifully perfect bricks. From all over the world, temple builders would send messengers to Ahmou of Octotato, as Bellevue was known at the time, to procure the finest square and rectangular blocks to build their sacred monuments with. To say that Ahmou was popular would be an understatement. Its was about this time that the Octotatoian decided that he needed a challenge, so he began telling people that, in his words, &quot;Nuzbh znxr Fgnghr.&quot;  Loosely translated, this was, &quot;I feel I need a new challenge, bricks are becoming too easy to make, so I'm going to build some statues and monuments.&quot;
 Of course, his first statue did not meet his own expectations. It was completely angular and had no curves whatsoever. The people of the area, however loved it for it's simplicity and it's strength. He made several very large statues out of all kinds of materials. Wood, Bronze, Quartz, Sandstone, and even Coal were all mediums which he made beautiful, though angular, monuments to the seasons and elements of his time. His fame reached far and wide, and finally he was approached to build something much smaller. &quot;Are you able to fashion, a skull that would represent your people to the 'ones who are searching?'&quot;
He thought about it for only a moment, and then he answered, &quot;Nuzbh pna Znxr fxhyy.&quot; Loosely translated this is...</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>&quot;I will of course make for you a statue that will cause GEOCACHERS to marvel at the skill of the ancient peoples!  They will FIND what they are seeking when they locate what AHMOU has placed inside the BOXES.&quot;

Look for the suspicious pile of rocks, in the natural looking bunch of weeds!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

It needs a container here, so it created one nearby.  There, another cache doppelganger, hidden.  It's Waiting for you to look for it.

 In our long standing quest for the crystal skulls, we discovered this artifact some time ago.  Unfortunately, someone else had already pilfered the dig.

We'll be researching this Crystal Skull in the near future to find its REAL story, but for now, a clever copy of the original ancient artifact has been placed in the proper place.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well described on the cache page. Wish I would have read it before. It looked much easier from the road.

Bushwached our way to the cache location. Spent some time scratching our ankles upon exiting the greenery. Nothing poisonous, just temporarily agrivating.

in the place you find it.

Please use stealth as you seek for this cache

when you search and find

The best time to search for this is early morning before muggles show up. If you are really an early morning person, come here and sit and watch the sunrise over Lake Minnewaska. Grab your camera and feel free to upload photos if you wish. Enjoy the view.

As we made our way to Kim's dads we placed a few more caches along the way, this one is our 165th cache hidden and yes another Winter Friendly one it is at that! We both hope you all will enjoy this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will take you just to the east of Vinning MN right off of Hwy 210 to this nice small park with tables and a small shelter to hide from the rain if need be. This is a great spot to stop, get out and stretch, have lunch, check your e-mail as there is free &quot;wifi&quot; here as well. While here please take a look at ALL the figures that were made by a local gentleman, Ken Nyberg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch for muggles and have fun on your hunt for this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you did.))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads Go Out To &quot;MinnesotaBuzzards&quot; For Being The FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Chose today for my great Inspriration Peak Adventure. It was way too windy for biking, canoeing or yardwork. Another great day to explore Minnesota. The trip consisted of a First To Find attempt, a State Park (Passport and Wildlife Challenge) a couple Earthcaches, Inspiration Peak itself and this Virtual. WooHoo! Good plan, great day.

Came to Vining to see &quot;The Big Toe&quot;. We were heading out of town before realizing there was a cache back at the intersection here, Nyberg Park. YaaHoo! Made our way back for a quick find, STL and replaced. Went inside the store for a snack and signed their book, too. Thanks for bringing me here. I am a big fan of these type of roadside attractions.

It is frequented by people in the summers in the evening, so it may not be appropriate to visit it at night.  It also could use a little CITO now and then. I filled up my container and I could have filled up a few more. 

If trying to access in the winter you may have to hike in from the main road.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a very small cache (NANO), so you must bring your own pen or pencil to log your find. Don't over-think this one. 

Good Luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

PLEASE NOTE: This cache is located on private property. Geocachers seeking this cache are asked to locate the container and replace it exactly as you found it. You will not need to venture any further than 20 ft into the property as the beacon for the cache is fairly obvious. The owner assumes you will adhere to all tenets of the Geocachers' Creed.

This simple hide is a location that allows me to place trackable items for a quick rest along their journey. Please feel free to trade with other trackables items as well. Good luck on your find.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a Winter Friendly cache, however not sure the road in is??

 I recall this area from my youth and annual field trips during Arbor Day. Many of the younger Norway Pines in this area were planted by me and my classmates. It has been a long time since I have visited this place and it's neat coming back to see the growth of those trees.

I brought my kids who join me on many geocaching outings with me to find this location and spent part of a day preparing this cache. I hope you enjoy it!

There is a trail that will take you to very near the cache and it's located to the west of the parking area about 200 feet. You do not to need to bushwhack the entire distance as some have already done. Make it easy on yourself.

You can park either on the street or this turnaround.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Heartland Trail was one of the first rail-to-trail projects in the country. It is a 49 mile multiple use trail between Park Rapids and Cass Lake. The trail is located entirely on a level abandoned railroad grade except for a four mile segment north of Walker, on sharply rolling terrain. The 27 mile segment between Park Rapids and Walker has a paved surface. This segment also has a second grassy treadway for horseback riding and mountain biking. The 20 mile segment from Walker to Cass Lake is also paved, with a partial dual treadway for snowmobiles with studded tracks.

Container is a film cannister with only a log and camo tape to match it's surrounding. Must bring your own writing utensil

Container is a small lock &amp; lock painted to match it's surrounding. You will need to leave the trail approximately 300 ft away where the slope is not as severe. 

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVERSE THE SLOPE FROM THE TRAIL TO THE CACHE, IT IS VERY STEEP!

This is a typical &quot;King Boreas&quot; style of hide, please return as found.

The Heartland Trail was one of the first rail-to-trail projects in the country. It is a 49 mile multiple use trail between Park Rapids and Cass Lake. The trail is located entirely on a level abandoned railroad grade except for a four mile segment north of Walker, on sharply rolling terrain. The 27 mile segment between Park Rapids and Walker has a paved surface. This segment also has a second grassy treadway for horseback riding and mountain biking. The 20 mile segment from Walker to Cass Lake is also paved, with a partial dual treadway for snowmobiles with studded tracks.

Container is a film cannister with only a log and camo tape to match it's surrounding. Must bring your own writing utensil

This is a defunct service station. I felt Hwy 71 north of Park Rapids needed a few caches along it, especially if you're making the trip north to Itasca State Park.

Quick Park &amp; Grab, film canister with a log, bring your own pencil. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

This trail is much better then alot of MM roads we have traveled to date, nice and wide with very few low spots. Might be a different story in early spring or late fall and after heavy rains? You will be looking for a Decon container.

((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you have.))

Good Luck, Enjoy And Most Of All Have Fun!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Both Kim and I hope you'll enjoy it! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache takes you into the southwest corner of Clearwater County right off of Hwy. 200. A nice Park &amp; Grab with plenty of off road parking, in the summer months anyways and a short walk to GZ from the Highway in the winter months. You will be looking for a Micro Size cache. There is no reason to damage or upset any property in your search for this cache, you'll see what I mean when you get there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is lots of history here.  The house that once stood here is now in Mahnomen.  There also used to be a store here.  This is also right next to a CCC camp.  This was home to hundreds of young men from 1934 – 1939.  It was the Buckboard Camp S 141 CCC number 2705.  It was a drought relief camp that worked the White Earth State Forest.  All of the lakes in the area were mapped by these workers.  The 2 stone pyramids about 600 feet east of here was the entrance to the camp.  There were over 20 buildings and a parade grounds at the camp.  Not much left after 70 years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;March Lake across the highway is home to a group of Trumpeter Swans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks roylake for the history of this cache sight which we have listed here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please respect the property when looking for this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck, Enjoy And Most Of All Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you have.))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads Go Out To conniewolf For The FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is our first in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads to Fargnot for the FTF on this one, the cold weather didn't seen to hold you back!

Yes, again this is a Winter Friendly cache and our 183rd Hide!

De-code the coords listed below with the Amazing Geocaching Mystery

When approching this cache you might want to park at the listed park cords and walk the short distance to the old trail as in the winter this road down to the lake gets VERY, VERY slippery, as we found this out the hard way today?

This is number 4 in a series of Solve &amp; Seek puzzle caches we
have put out. Ground Zero (GZ) cords are located below, you just
have to figure them out / de-code them? Once you get to GZ you'll
be looking for a small type container. Yes, it's another one of our
&quot;Winter Friendly&quot; caches and our 187th Hide! Here's what you have
to do to solve this puzzle cache shown below. De-code the cords
listed below with Our Amazing Geocaching Mystery Wheel. However for
this cache you'll need TWO &quot;Code Keys&quot;. To figure out the cords to
this cache you'll need TWO sets of Code Keys, one for the North
Cords and one for the West cords. Once you figure them both out
you'll have the coordinates needed to get you to GZ where the
search begins for the hidden cache container. This will be a nice
.16 mile hike in to GZ on a nice level trail. You can park right
near the trail head, if you can't find the trail head your not at
the right spot to go after this cache. No bushwacking what so ever
is needed to make it to GZ. Good luck, enjoy and have FUN!

This is number 5 in a series of Solve &amp; Seek puzzle caches we
have put out. Ground Zero (GZ) cords are located below, you just
have to make some sence out of them? This will be a nice P&amp;G
once you figure out how to get to GZ. Once at GZ you'll be looking
for a micro type camoed container. This is our 188th Hide! No
bushwacking what so ever is needed to make it to GZ. Good luck,
enjoy and have FUN!

This is our 4th in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly.

This is our 5th in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads to Fargnot for the FTF, you were busy today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache On!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Here you'll be looking for a small container, so please bring your own pencil. There is no reason to be handling these figures in your search. You will have to watch for muggles and use stealth at ALL times as this is a busy area during the summer months. Pack a lunch and enjoy your stop as there is a couple picnic tables for use in this little area.

Please respect ALL property when looking for this cache.

Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!!

((Please replace cache how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you did))

The cache is located on a old section of County Road 2, notice the old twin yellow lines are still showing. This road will not be plowed in the winter months however it wouldn't be a real long walk into GZ and it would be a flat walk at that!

This is our 7th in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. Some of these caches during the spring and fall months could be wet to get to. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads go to Fargnot for the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache On!!</groundspeak:long_description>

In the winter months this gravel road is plowed making for some nice caching.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The cache / GZ is located just northwest of the town of Fosston by a few miles or so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;((Please replace this cache exactly how you found it or better, so the next cacher/s can enjoy the cache as you did.))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Most Of All &quot;Have Fun&quot;!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is our 8th in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. Some of these caches during the spring and fall months could be wet to get to. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads go to Fargnot for the FTF on this one, cold weather and all didn't seen to hold you back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache On!</groundspeak:long_description>

If not it's a very short walk to the cache from the road, under 150' or so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please respect the property when looking for this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you did))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads go out to the  momandson2006 team for this FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is our 12th and final in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you ALL enjoyed this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads To Cowboy 41 For The FTF!!</groundspeak:long_description>

I was out with two of my daughters up from the Twin Cities, jenfrenzy &amp; kit kat, who isn't signed up @ Geocaching.com yet for an afternoon of caching. kit kat had never done any caching before this and she just loved it, had a ball. After a 12 or so finds of mine they both wanted to hide a cache so off we headed to this area as I always carry my bags of new caches with me. Once to this area I told them to pick one out of the bag and off into the woods the three of us headed. The hide was made by my girls and all of us hope you'll enjoy it! Kim missed out on this hide (her 1st one),,,as she was work'in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will take you into Clover township one of Clearwater Counties northern townships. The cache is hidden just off a Minimum Maintenance road which is NOT plowed in the winter months. Once you reach GZ you will be looking for a micro sized container, log only, so bring a pencil to sign the log.

This cache takes you into Alaska Township in Beltrami County. You are looking for a large container. This is a great area just south of the Red Lake Indian Reservation. This cache is located just off the Balm Lake PWA Road, which by the way isn't plowed in the winter. However this hide is only in a few hundred feet in so it makes for a nice winter walk. In the summer months you should be able to drive to within 100 feet or so of the cache, however some bushwacking will be needed in the summer months as well. Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads go out to TopHat &amp; EarlGrey for the FTF on this cache, 02/28/10!</groundspeak:long_description>

You'll be looking for a Camoed Peanut Butter Jaw for  the final cache (GZ) and camoed small size containers with cordinates to the next stage listed within each. This is a great area just to the south of the Red Lake Indian Reservation. The area is located in the Balm Lake PWA, which by the way the road into this landing isn't plowed to in the winter months. Getting to this area in the winter months would make for a LONG snowshoe walk in or a snowmobile would make it real nice and real fun! In the summer months you should be able to drive right into this area with any troubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck, Enjoy And Most Of All Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads Go Out To momandson2006 For The FTF!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;FI26V16 - Final Stage&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final Stage (GZ)&lt;br/&gt;S226V16 - 2nd Stage&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;2nd Stage&lt;br/&gt;S326V16 - 3rd Stage&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;3rd Stage</groundspeak:long_description>
