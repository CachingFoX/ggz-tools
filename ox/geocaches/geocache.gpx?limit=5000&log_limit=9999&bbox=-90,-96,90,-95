            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So why aren't you at the beach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East Matagorda Peninsula is one of the prizes of Texas.  The beach goes on for miles and if you want to avoid crowds, this is the place to come.  Even in the height of the beach season you can drive until there is no one in sight.  If you have four wheel drive, that is.  We spent a lovely day at the beach near this cache, swimming and kayaking in the surf.  So whatsa mata.  Why aren't you at the beach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After your drive down the beach, go through the break in the dunes and follow the driving track a short way.  Then take a brief walk, being careful of the local flora, it bites.   We didn't see any fauna on the ground, but there are probably some that bite in the area.  The box is nestled on the edge of a dense thicket of  scrub trees just past the dunes.  It is attached by a cable to a branch, in hopes that the ammo can will not wash away.  When placing it we were treated to a show as some hawks took off,  circled around a few time then flew away.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents are a log book, pen, a few toys, some biners, and a few Off insect repellent wipes.  Use the wipes if you need them but please don't take them away.  First to find prize is a cute little LED lantern.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will  need a $6 beach permit to travel here, it is good for one calender year.   The store at N28° 41.437  W95° 58.095 sells them.  The drive is uncomplicated but the cache  is some distance from the nearest road.  Please use some common sense before you commit to the long drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Team Four Paw for the FTF. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Around 1930 the courthouse was heavily remodeled with the removal of the clock tower and the addition of stucco and wings on the ends to create an Art Deco appearance. In the 1940's a new courthouse was built one block south, which itself was altered in the 1970's.</groundspeak:long_description>

For over 20 years research into fig production was quite strong and at one time the station led the world in fig varieties and research. A hurricane in 1941 devastated the station and destroyed the fig orchard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1930s the station became a center for animal husbandry with an emphasis on cattle parasites. A method of controlling cattle liver flukes as developed here, as well as valuable research into other parasites, pinkeye and vaccines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to state budget cuts, the station was closed in 2003 and is now managed by the Texas Agrilife Extension service. The Master Gardeners, Master Naturalists and Master Horticulturalists use the station as a teaching center, holding many classes on their respective subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache has been placed by the property owner with all the permissions needed from the Brazoria County Sheriffs Department, Brazoria County Civil DA's office and Facilities Management. This is a simple park and grab, you won’t need to enter the station. Feel free to take one of the souvenir postcards.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

and head out for Paradise Island! (A boat may be helpful, but may
not be necessary.)
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We were out boating today and saw this little park. So we placed a
cache near it. The island looked cool, so we put it there!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It may not take that much to get it. There is no first to find
prize (other than glory on the cache page). But be sure to
embellish your log and make it sound at least as exciting as it
really was getting it, if not moreso!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently the park across the way is private property. Recommend
not going that way. I didn't. . Island is in a navigable waterway, so
come that way!

came here. There were 3 kids swinging on the rope and jumping into
the water, as well as climbing to the top of the pipes and jumping
off into the creek below. So we joined them -- for the swing part.
Lots of fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So be sure to tell us how much fun you had swinging and jumping off
the top. Embellish as needed. The ladder to top is on the other
side of the creek, should you be crazy enough to do it. The rope is
near the cache. And you don't need a boat to get to the cache --
it's on the bulkhead.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are multiple ways to get to the area where the cache is. For
the most part, it's a stroll over fairly flat, sometimes mowed
land. But GZ? Well, that's another story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We went 4-wheeling out here before, and I had noticed there are no caches out this way. So we went 4 wheeling on Thanksgiving and found the perfect place for a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new subdivision being built around this area, but where the cache is located is in a utility easement. No worries about development here. You can get to it from multiple directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be forewarned - along this route there are often 3 and 4 wheeler&lt;br/&gt;and motorcycle muggles riding the trails, which extend from 518 to&lt;br/&gt;Tuscan Lakes. There were also a considerable number of mossies out&lt;br/&gt;when the cache was placed.</groundspeak:long_description>

Beware, she is probably watching you. If you see her out just yell &quot;Hi Mom!&quot;. That is what most of the people in town that know her call her. Mom is intrigued by geocaching but can't walk far so she can't go with us much. She is a former treasure hunter using her metal detector (pre-geocaching days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't park in the driveway or on Sunset, there will be plenty of parking space in the street out front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our first cache, we know it is ridiculously easy. We were trying to give Mom a way to participate. Don't be surprised if she sneaks up on you.</groundspeak:long_description>

So after the first ABC Event it was decided there needed to be one here again. Here it is.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Be sure to stop by an ABC event sometime and meet the local (and some not so local) cachers! So far they have been held at the nearby establishment, but will likely rotate to other nearby places from time to time. Although new, they have been held on the Thursday in the moth that is between the 20th and 26th of the month -- and are always a great time.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One strand of thorns and a couple tiny PI plants nearby, but easy enough to get to while avoiding all of that.    </groundspeak:long_description>

or two...
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While one or both &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; frequent this area, none were seen
this evening when I placed this cache. Don't expect to find either.
But do expect a little adventure while getting this cache! Lets
see....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tall 'grass'? Check.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Woody, stiff weeds? Check.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long trek on uneven ground? Check.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thorns? Likely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mud? After rain - you betcha.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And to top it off......Inconvenient parking? Check!!
&lt;br /&gt;
I currently rate this as a 3 terrain, but at certain times of the
year it could be less. Google Earth may show you a time when it
might be easier. No ticks or snakes seen, but would not surprise me
either, depending upon time of year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A specimin of a conatiner, it's either a large micro, or a small
small. Currently has log, geocoin, and can hold a few trinkets. FTF
will receive an unactivated geocoin for his or her efforts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is recommended where you would park for Acro Cache
(GC18ZVA), which you can grab while you're here if you haven't
already.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Liberty Tree is certainly a piece of local heritage in Friendswood. It branches out over Spreading Oaks Avenue, just slightly behind the Quaker Church. Friendswood pride saved the mighty oak in 1976 when road improvements threatened the tree. Through citizens efforts, the new road was routed around the tree and the oak was designated &quot;The Liberty Tree&quot;. Not long ago, the tree underwent some trimming to make way for power lines leading into a new housing development causing outrage among Friendswood citizens. As a means to appease those enraged by the butchery of the city symbol, the City of Friendswood enacted a tree ordinance in order to protect the Liberty Tree from future damages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right behind the tree, surrounded by a picket fence, is a time capsule. Contents of the capsule, to be opened July 4, 2076, will reveal to future residents a picture of Friendswood 100 years earlier. I tried to find out what is in the capsule, but none of the current residents I asked, or the reference desk a the city Library seem to know. If you know what is in the capsule please include it in your log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area can be viewed from the roadside, but be very careful as there is not a &quot;designated parking area&quot;. You should be able to pull off into the grassy area to the west of the tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In an effort to not miss too many busses from the one I normally take, I promptly rushed out the door -- without a flashlight.  Smart [:P].  GPSr bouncing all over.  Loved three spots.  Used the headlights and just as I was about to give up, bingo.  [8D]

I'd heard about the Liberty Tree and the time capsule, but never seen it.  Looked at some stuff online last night.  Thanks bbqbob2 and no_muggle for the interesting history lesson and the neat spot!  #386.</groundspeak:text>

The goal was to provide many amenities and increase the detention capability. The existing detention ponds were deepened on a gradual slope as part of the project. Wetlands plantings will be added to both ponds and will serve as a natural filtering system as the water flows from north to south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention has been paid to assure that all the plantings and grasses will be beneficial to the environment. The ponds will be equipped with a state of the art aeriation system that will improve the storm water quality that is discharged into Clear Creek and maintain a beautiful clear lake affect in the ponds. Next year the ponds will be open for catch and realease fishing. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

spied some level of obscurity from muggles, and the need for a
cache was thus born. A nano easily accessible from within feet of
where you can park. As far as nanos go, this one should be pretty
easy. &lt;b&gt;Please replace it EXACTLY where you found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry - no room for swag, no pen/pencil, and no FTF prize (other
than glory).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Grab your dog (and kids) and take a walk. Or take your bike and
take a ride. Several new caches on a new greenbelt for you to find!
A few colorful ones (titles at least) for some friends going for a
challenge cache. Hopefully this cache won't get you teed off,
rather, just give you a good laugh. Be sure to replace the log and
contents as you found them. .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The former golf course is open as green space in daylight hours
only. Please respect that so we can have fun here. A variety of
hides, sizes, styles, etc. have been placed in two sections of the
course. Yes -- the other sections are open! Go place some!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take some photos while you're out. Everyone loves photos.

I'll give it a 2.5 for difficulty as this was only our second attempt at caching, a 1.5 for terrain (slightly muddy &amp; overgrown), 3.0 for Awesomeness because when we finally found it we got such a thrill! 3.0 for size...

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Grab your dog (and kids) and take a walk. Or take your bike and
take a ride. Several new caches on a new greenbelt for you to find!
A few colorful ones (titles at least) for some friends going for a
challenge cache. Depending upon when you go, you'll find that this
area smells like sasquatch lives here. If you find it stinky,
you're getting close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The former golf course is open as green space in daylight hours
only. Please respect that so we can have fun here. A variety of
hides, sizes, styles, etc. have been placed in two sections of the
course. Yes -- the other sections are open! Go place some!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take some photos while you're out. Especially if you see sasquatch!
Everyone loves photos. Especially when you upload a few to the

This is the start of a new series that I had in response to that discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you live in Houston, you KNOW it is HOT in the summer. So most of us tend to become Sofa Dudes (aka we don't want to cache and want to sit on the sofa where it is cool). This series aims to be the totally opposite of the previously implied caching series. There will be no bees to maneuver. There will be no physically demanding requirements to get to the cache. In general they will be fairly close from vehicle to cache. A quick way to get a smiley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to add to this series, feel free. I just ask that you email me for a number first so that we will have an accurate count and none of the numbers will overlap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache:&lt;br/&gt;In case it has recently rained, then boots could come in handy (or is it footy).&lt;br/&gt;Nearby parking is available.&lt;br/&gt;Please be stealthy if anyone is around and protect the sanctity of the hide.&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Basically just room for a log. Once found, please unclip the cache container from the hiding device before removing the log. It's not the most sturdy contraption, and this will keep it in-action longer. &lt;b&gt;Be sure to re-clip after signing the log before replacing!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Also - beware of muggles. They are often everywhere if the weather is nice. Just wait for a break in them. It shouldn't take too long and you'll have your chance!&lt;/b&gt;

For 35+ years I have lived in or around this area and never knew
this was here. I was scouting a place for a cache and came upon
this gravesite and spooky looking tree. I immediately developed
plans for said spooky tree, which quickly fell apart when I found
out the coords were about 10' too close to an existing cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
I normally do not like cemetery caches, but this intrigued me and
wasn't a normal cemetery. I decided to see who the Henrys were.
Google turned up the following:
&lt;br /&gt;
The grave sites are located north of Bay Area Park, Pasadena,Texas,
in wooded area. This is an old family settlement. Two graves with a
fence around it. In great condition. There are four graves in the
Henry Cemetery. The daughter of Jourdan Henry and her husband are
buried at the foot of the Henry's graves. They have no
gravestones.
&lt;br /&gt;
The Henrys were land owners of Harris County,Texas. 1902-1903,
Jordan Henry is listed with 252 acres in Seabrook, Texas. It is
said that Jourdan Henry's date of birth is 1844, though his
tombstone says 1846.
&lt;br /&gt;
During the middle of the 1800's about a dozen families of European
origin settled on the east banks of Middle Bayou. Their settlement
was called &quot;Middle Bayou&quot; or &quot;The Old French Settlement,&quot; named
after the four Louisiana French families living there for several
decades. They floated barges with their produce down the bayou to
market. The settlement had a post office and a school called the
&quot;Middle Bayou School&quot;.
&lt;br /&gt;
Additional information and photos of deeds, artifacts, and such can
be found HERE: on this website:  http://www.freewebs.com/graveyardwolf/henrycemeteryphotos.htm

&lt;b&gt;The cache:&lt;/b&gt; is a soda tube, placed at .1 miles from the
nearest cache across the street. No real room for swag, and no
prize for FTF other than glory noted eternally on the cache
page.  Recommend parking at Bay Area Park across the street and walking to the cache from there.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Congrats to &lt;u&gt;zoothornrollo&lt;/u&gt; for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;

It is&lt;br/&gt;close to the road, and you can park in the median turn-around spots&lt;br/&gt;or further down in the subdivision entrances and take a nice&lt;br/&gt;stroll and pick up a few others ;). The path along the way is stroller and wheelchair&lt;br/&gt;accessible, but the last few feet to the cache itself may be&lt;br/&gt;unpractical (especially after rain) for a wheelchair. A stroller&lt;br/&gt;should be ok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is large enough to hold small travel bugs and geocoins white they await the continuation of thier journeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Have you heard of these new pens?  No, really stay with me.  There are these new pens with erasable ink, really nice gel ink.  They are quite smooth, unlike other erasable pens.  Well I bought some the other day just to try them out and they do erase cleanly.  Really very nice pens.  Well it turns out there is a secret as to why they erase so well, that I know now, but didn't know the morning before I set out on the water.  See, I got to this cache, paddling from Bay Area Park with my kayak Meetup group.  I made a quick stop to find the cache while the group kept going on.  So I was in a bit of  a hurry.  The coords were good and the find was easy.  After opening the tube and extracting the log I put pen to paper and nothing.  Just a blank area where my name should have been.  I tried again and then tried writing on my arm.  Nothing.  Then on closer inspection I saw just a trace of ink, clear ink.  I was in agony.  I couldn't stay with the group and go back for a new pen.

So I made an executive decision, I'd just sign the logs in clear ink.  Later I looked more closely at the package the pen came in.  It seems the ink isn't truly erasable, but the friction of the eraser heats it up and the ink turns clear.  It just so happens that the ink will also turn clear sitting on the dash of a car parked in the sun.  Cooling the ink will make it visible again and a few minutes in my freezer did in fact restore the color to the ink.

The result of this sad tale is that all the logs I singed this day along Armand Bayou are signed in invisible ink.  No really, it's all true, I swear on my 60CSX.  Just put the log in the freezer for a few seconds and you will see.  Any way, that is my tale of woe. Have mercy on this poor cacher.

It's normally quiet and peaceful, but there may well be joggers and other dogs walking their muggles about.

This is a continuation of my parody series that I had in response to that discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you live in Houston, you KNOW it is HOT in the summer. So most of us tend to become Sofa Dudes (aka we don't want to cache and want to sit on the sofa where it is cool). This series aims to be the totally opposite of the previously implied caching series. There will be no bees to maneuver. There will be no physically demanding requirements to get to the cache. In general they will be fairly close from vehicle to cache. A quick way to get a smiley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you would like to add to this series, feel free. I just ask that you email me for a number first so that we will have an accurate count and none of the numbers will overlap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache:&lt;br/&gt;Nearby parking is available.&lt;br/&gt;Smaller than a micro.&lt;br/&gt;Please be stealthy if anyone is around and protect the sanctity of the hide.&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So Syd and I wanted to get this one before the event, and have the HGA event be #300.   But after seeing a spider the size of a softball, with a body thicker than a golf ball, and a web big enough and strong enough to stop a bowling ball -- and my daughter -- I decided that 1) the cache had to be a certain container, and 2) it was not to be found.

So we went to the event.  And I talked to CO.   Then felt like a total doofus.  Came back and got the cache.  I can't help you with a hint on this, but I will say to stay away from the spider.  Wish I had had my camera to post a photo of the sucker.  Two of those and Andrew Zimmer has dinner.  Just sayin'.  #1,907.</groundspeak:text>

This is the third installment of the CLAPS series!The third installment of this series has 13 caches and runs&lt;br/&gt;upstream on Armand Bayou towards its source, and is designed so&lt;br/&gt;that the caches would be obtained, primarily, by paddling (kayak,&lt;br/&gt;canoe, raft, etc.). Of course, there may be other ways to get to&lt;br/&gt;the cache. We leave that to you. We hope that other cachers will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to this paddle series or start their own in other nearby&lt;br/&gt;areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound like fun? It should be!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Clear Lake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Area Paddle Series!  This is the third installment of the CLAPS series!The third installment of this series has 13 caches and runs&lt;br/&gt;upstream on Armand Bayou towards its source, and is designed so&lt;br/&gt;that the caches would be obtained, primarily, by paddling (kayak,&lt;br/&gt;canoe, raft, etc.). Of course, there may be other ways to get to&lt;br/&gt;the cache. We leave that to you. We hope that other cachers will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to this paddle series or start their own in other nearby&lt;br/&gt;areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound like fun? It should be! But before you attempt this series, please consider the&lt;br/&gt;following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will get wet, and possibly soaked, doing this series.&lt;br/&gt;Bring a couple gallon-sized ziplock baggies -- one for your GPSr (easy to operate in a large bag), one for your camera and phone, and one for anything else you don't want to get wet. Trap a little air in them and they float should they fall out of the boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring sunscreen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a hat - especially in summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring lots of bottled water and/or sports drinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wear a PFD /Lifejacket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your camera... but don't drop it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your cell phone... just in case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No motors are allowed in Armand Bayou from GPS marker #4 upstream through trail marker #26 (and various other places off the lake - should this series expand from others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no attributes for alligators. Watch out for alligators! They are out there... somewhere. DO NOT FEED or pester the alligators - you could&lt;br/&gt;get in trouble in more ways than one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact me through my geocaching.com profile if you need ideas on how to get paddling to get these caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out the CLAPS Challenge Cache on gc.com - GC2ANX3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Crankset Cacher for FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally listed on gc.com on 7/31/2010.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The quirky comedy Brewster McCloud was shot in Houston primarily to take advantage of the newly built Astrodome.  But of course several other places were featured, one of which was the now demolished Astroworld amusement park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astroworld was the first and only large amusement park in Houston and was still new at the time of filming.  To the thrill seekers of today, it would have seemed to be little more than a kiddie park, but to those of us in Houston at the time, it was a blast.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lost World Adventure was used in the film.  This ride featured a river boat that carried passengers along the &quot;Rio Misterio&quot; deeper and deeper into the mysterious jungle.  The sights along the river were highlighted by a mock serious commentary from the boats pilot.  One memorable event along the ride was the boat heading straight for a waterfall while the pilot claimed not to be in control.  Just at the last moment, the boat swerved, leaving the passengers dry.   Just before the boat house came into view, the pilot would announce that we were entering the scariest part of the ride, the return to civilization.  Sure its campy, but as young kids we just ate it up.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache you are looking for is hidden at the back of the property that used to hold the park.   There were some great ideas for redevelopment of the land but nothing has happened for years.  The street is not very busy so cars tend to speed through and will not be expecting to see parked cars. Try parking on the intersecting street west of the cache or in the slightly closer drive on the south side of the street. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Brewster McCloud is an offbeat 1970 Robert Altman comedy shot in Houston to take advantage of the newly built Astrodome.  Nicknamed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World,&quot; the officially named Harris County Domed Stadium was the largest building in the world and the only enclosed stadium.  It was know for its scoreboard composed of thousands of light bulbs that played a western themed animation every time the Astros hit a home run or the Oilers made a touchdown.  In addition to the Dome, the score board was a technological wonder itself in 1965.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The film is a story of a boy, Brewster McCloud, who secretly lives in a unused Astrodome bomb shelter.  Brewster is played by Bud Court, fresh from a role as the PA announcer in Altman's great film M*A*S*H, and whose next effort would be the wonderful 1971 even more offbeat film Harold and Maude.  Brewster becomes involved in some assorted mischief around town leading the police to hunt for him.  While living in his hideout, he also dreams of flying and builds a set of wings, which he ultimately uses in an attempt to evade capture by the police, the movies climax, making a glorious flight around the inside of the Dome.  It's worth a viewing as an example of the zeitgeist but is hard to find. </groundspeak:long_description>

Well, today is the 2011 Scout Fair and I took the kiddo-s and my nephew there today. I stopped on the way there with them and it was here this time! Yea. Kids had fun, and nephew was glad to find some Treasure! 2nd in a row with this exact scenario (RIP Oilers was the other one). Syd joined me, but the boys were too engrossed in their DS game at that point -- something about a smiley vs. a high score.  #2,358.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Right Stuff is Philip Kaufman's telling of the great Tom Wolfe book about the early days of the maned space program.  The film followed Wolfe's general principal of never letting the facts get in the way of a good story.  Both film and book blur the line between fiction and non-fiction using real characters in real circumstances but adding liberally to the story to capture the spirit that the writer wants to develop.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The film was shot all over the country, but because Houston was the center of the manned space program, many scenes were done here.  These include the bar-b-que to welcome the astronauts to Houston filmed inside the Astrodome.  This was one deviation from fact because the Dome was not yet completed so the actual event took place elsewhere.  In the movie, the events of the bar-b-que are interspersed with shots of Chuck Yeager making a failed attempt to set one last altitude record.  The events were actually 17 months apart but were symbolic of the passing of “the right stuff,” from the Yeager style seat of the pants test pilot to the engineer astronaut with advanced college degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll get a view of the Dome looking down Stadium Drive.  Easy parking.  About as low muggle as the area gets.  You are looking for a camoed medicine bottle.  Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the concern for the coordinates, I rechecked them and found differing amounts of error in several new readings. It just seems to depend on the direction from which you approach the cache.  Apparently the location has enough signal confusion to disrupt GPS accuracy.  Park in the lot north of the cache, walk beside the building and look for a small path between the oleanders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Google Earth produced these cords  29° 41.418'N  by  95° 24.434'W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Manofsteel73 and thacatfish on being FTF. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
area of Baytown began to be settled as early as 1822. One of its
earliest residents was Nathaniel Lynch, who set up a ferry crossing
at the junction of the San Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou. The
ferry service that he started is still in operation today, now
known as the Lynchburg Ferry. Other early residents of Baytown
include William Scott, one of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three
Hundred, and Ashbel Smith, who owned a plantation in the area. The
city now known as Baytown was originally three separate towns. The
first of these was Goose Creek, named for the bayou of the same
name where Canadian Geese wintered and whose name is still
reflected in the area's Goose Creek CISD, whose establishment dates
back to before 1850. With the discovery of the Goose Creek Oil
Field, the rival communities of Pelly in the late 1910s, and East
Baytown in the early 1920s, developed as early boom-towns. The
&quot;East&quot; in East Baytown was later dropped because it was west of
Goose Creek. Serious talk of merging the three cities began shortly
after World War I, but the community of Baytown was opposed to this
idea. However, in 1947, the three cities finally agreed to
consolidate. The citizens settled on the name Baytown for the new
combined city. Baytown as it is known today was officially founded
January 24, 1948. In 1916, the Humble Oil &amp; Refining Company,
founded by one-time Texas governor Ross S. Sterling and his
associates, in developing the Goose Creek Oil Field, built the
first offshore drilling operation in Texas and the second in the
United States. The company later built the Baytown Refinery, which
would become one of the largest Exxon Refineries in the world.
Since then, many other refineries have been built in the area.
Exxon-Mobil is still one of the major employers in the city and now
runs over ten plants in the area. Steel manufacturing in Baytown
began in 1970 when United States Steel opened the Texas Works near
the city. The 48 inch seamless pipe used in the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System was produced at the facility's pipe mill. The plant
was officially closed in July 1986 (never reopening after a
nationwide strike against the company), due to a poor economic
climate and the decline of American steel in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

 A series
     of caches dedicated to my favorite film genre, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western&quot;&gt;Spaghetti
     Western&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the quintessential series of films
     starring Clint Eastwood. No matter how many times I watch them
     they always evoke the spirit of the old west. Ironically the
     films were mostly shot in Spain and Italy. Surprising how
     easily the areas passed for the American West! I hope you
     enjoy the caches as much as I enjoy the films!!!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This series is designed to emphasize some of the lesser known young forests in the Houston area. The urban micro forests planted in the green spaces created by modern development. This micro forest covers a one half mile strip of new growth abutting the Southwest Freeway between S. Rice Ave and Chimney Rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This forest offers the busy urban dweller a rare place of solitude in the midst of the chaos of modern life. A touch of nature in an area passed by hundreds of thousands of people yet known to only a few. Like other forests in the region it is composed mostly of pine and oak trees but contains many other varieties of trees, shrubs and flowering plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wild life reflects the nature of the urban setting. I could hear the sounds of young children playing on the other side of the wall that separates the forest from nearby homes. Within the forest there was ample evidence of nesting by a number of that most abundant of urban wildlife, homo nondomus. As always when caching, use your best judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container has a log book and room to hold small trade items and pathtags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulation to outlaw101for being FTF. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache commemorates an eminently forgettable coming of age movie filmed in Houston.  The main claim to fame of [i]My Best Friend Is a Vampire[/i] is that it stared the young Robert Sean Leonard as a cute, lovable and romantically awkward teen who becomes a vampire.  Leonard is better known as the cute, lovable and romantically awkward Dr. James Wilson on the TV series [i]House MD.[/i]  While not really a bad movie as vampire comedies go, it isn’t particularly funny either.  It was aimed at a target market of not to discerning teens in 1987 so it is full of cliches, 20 year old cultural stereotypes and predictable plot lines.  Still it was better than [i]Twilight[/i].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the movie was filmed indoors. The screen time shot outdoors is largely car chases, usually the result of a bumbling pair of vampire hunters mistakenly trying to kill the wrong person.  Several chases occur downtown that intentionally highlight the modern sculpture in the plazas outside the buildings, seen as the cars screech around the corners.  Of course one of these turns goes awry resulting  in the destruction of a faux sculpture.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The placement of the cache is the result of a car chase that leaves downtown along Allen Parkway and disappears after a curve in the road just past Waugh Drive.  As a police radio announces the chase on Allen Parkway the cars turn up racing down Richmond Avenue some 8 miles away.  The chase ended in a humorously improbable crash in front of this newly developed shopping center, still mostly empty.  The camera angles assure you get a picture of the signs for the Safeway that used to be here and for the Stop and Go, now a Valero, showing a price of $0.58 for a gallon of gas.  However, being a teen movie, the action picked up from there when the protagonist and his girlfriend steal a police car. It wouldn't really be a spoiler to tell what happened next, because it was quite obvious to anyone watching the film, but from this point I just used the fast forward to get to the end.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movie is available as an instant watch from Netflix if you have a fondness for campy films.  Just don't waste one of your selections to rent the disk. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">[i]FM[/i] tells the story of a Los Angeles radio station that has become popular because of the great music it plays.  All is well until the corporate minions come in to strip the station of its autonomy and make even greater profits by playing more commercials, including those annoying &quot;Join the Army&quot; ditties.  The station manager publicly resigns, and the DJ's rebel, calling on the listeners to help save the station from the evil corporate takeover.  The ensuing event result in a riot in front of the station offices to the the sounds of Queen's [i]We Will Rock You[/i], which is only quelled when an old guy in a limo pulls in to announce that the corporation has heard its listeners and will give them what they want.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario of a great radio station going bad was familiar to those of us in college at the time.  Radio stations were always remaking themselves to hold a certain demographic segment.  This became even more heightened as popular music stations were increasing in number while disco and other non rock and roll styles of music becoming more prominent.  This movie was something of a precursor to the Clear Channel take over of radio that started 20 year later.  Still as a movie [i]FM[/i] was pretty bland.  The acting was dull and the deus ex machina ending uninspiring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the movie was set in Los Angeles, they filmed one scene at a Linda Ronstadt concert in Houston at the former Summit. The great concert site suffered a series of corporate takeovers of its own, first when naming rights were sold and it was renamed the Compact Center.  Later the Toyota Center opened downtown, replacing it as the city's main sports and concert venue. Then it became Lakewood Church and the corporate headquarters of Joel Olsteen Ministries.    For those of us that came of age going to concerts  in the seventies and early eighties, it will always be the Summit.  The sounds of ZZ Top, The Who and The Grateful Dead and the hundreds of other bands that played there will echo between those walls forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is placed across the street from the west side of the building.  This side is where the tour buses would drive in to deliver the performers. The ticket booth was at the entrance level.  The west face is also the least changed by the church remodeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Parker Plus for being first to find. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache was placed to highlight the artwork next to the building, a large sculpture of a saxophone partially constructed from car body parts belonging to old Volkswagen Beetles.  The building originally housed “Billy Blues,” one outlet of a now defunct chain of theme restaurants that featured live music.  The restaurants motto was “Bar-B-Que all day, cook all night.” The sculpture caused some controversy when it was installed.  The City of Houston viewed it as an unlicensed sign and wanted the restaurant to comply with city sign codes, which the sculpture could not.  The restaurant successfully claimed that it was art and not regulated by the city ordinances, allowing it to be kept in place.  However you look at it, the art did make for a good advertisement for Billy Blues.  Update: The building has been renovated and is now &quot;The Horn&quot; club, bringing a great deal of traffic to the parking lot.  Please use discretion when there is activity in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a park and grab away from the sax and the building.  In fact you could retrieve it without leaving your car, if you parked just right.  The new container is a bison tube.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Dyfen on the first to find. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pct3.hctx.net/parks/georgebush.aspx&quot;&gt;George Bush Park&lt;/a&gt;. Located in Barker Reservoir the area can flood and be muddy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/api/geocache/OXZTC6G/The Not-So-OK Corral for OXen1.jpg&quot;&gt;The Not-So-OK Corral for OXen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at the above coordinates you will find a small camouflaged pill
bottle. Around you will be the 
Not-So-OK Corral for OXen. Listen for the echoes of a bygone era as you
explore this relic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew more about the area. There is a sign near the parking that says a railroad used to run through here so I expect they probably staged animals for loading and unloading in the corral. The USACE took over the area some time in the 1920's for the Barker reservoir flood plain to help tame Buffalo Bayou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be aware that this cache is off the trails in GBP. The usual TX hazards apply! (Snakes, Thorns, Poison Ivy, Feral Hogs, Stray Cattle...)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a unique OX container! I decided to hide this since so many people were missing the corral when visiting my other cache, so if you have done my similarly named GC that's close by, well...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Y'all come back now, ya' hear!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Thanks for visiting!!!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a historical marker in front of the building which you can visit if you dare! (Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry&quot;&gt;some of you&lt;/a&gt; might even be welcome!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hid this container here some time ago and was working on a themed puzzle, but got skunked on the location so it may as well live here!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;After several months of severe drought, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Park&quot;&gt;George Bush Park&lt;/a&gt; was as dry as a desert and just waiting for some stray spark to set it off. That spark came the afternoon of September 13, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing the breaking news on a local channel, I grabbed my camera and headed toward the park. As I drew closer I was shocked at the size of the area ablaze. I managed to find a pretty good viewing location and you can see where by visiting this cache! The cache gallery has some pictures and I uploaded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/ceqRpnGbSrY&quot;&gt;video to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; which I took very close to the area of the cache. In fact, if you look closely you can see the cache location in the first thirty seconds of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been estimated as many as 1500 acres burned in the fire. Fortunately the area that burned was undeveloped, so besides the devastation to the wildlife no real damage occurred. However, the true tragedy in all of this is that several caches, including four of my own, got cooked! :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be Safe Out There!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;          </groundspeak:long_description>

Looking back maybe that wasnt so safe but its still a nice area and is very quiet if you stay out of the bayou! I'm a photographer now and plan to do some shots down here one day. Look for my 35mm canister and remember when you used to use film, did you like taking pics as a kid? Take a pic now if you can at the location! I'd love to see!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is not much to say about this movie as it is in post production as of the publishing of the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[i]The Tree of Life[/i] stars Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Joanna Going, Fiona Shaw, and Jessica Chastain. Filmed at locations all over the state and employing the building at 1100 Louisiana in Houston.  The area around the building is saturated with caches, so I chose a more remote location that has a good view of the building.  If you look north from here you can see the prominent pink granite building featuring the &quot;cut away&quot; bays in the sides.  The 55 story Skidmore, Owens and Merrill skyscraper stands handsomely next to the green glass Wells Fargo building.  The cutaway side made room for a rather stark bank lobby and an outdoor plaza.  Originally built by that great shaper  of the Houston skyline, Hines  Interests, to house First International bank. It has gone through a number of names as the economy has changed and is now called Enterprise Plaza after the major tenant, Enterprise Product Partners. The ultra modern former bank lobby has been converted into a home for the PageSoutherlandPage architectural firm and serves as the location where Penn's character works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a few minutes, go the few extra blocks to get a closer look.  It is one of the more interesting and innovative buildings among the many great contributions that Hines made to the city skyline during the boom years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to jjax12 for being FTF! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Set Up&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time there was a handsome young playboy of a fireman in Houston named Greg (Jim Hutton). The leader of his company is a gruff old guy named Chance (John Wayne), who has taken the younger man under his wing and is grooming Greg for leadership. Greg thinks of Chance as a father figure. They are called to a fire where Chance is badly hurt and Greg gets the task of persuading Chance's estranged daughter, Tish (Katherine Ross), to come see her father. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boy Meets Girl and They Have a Fight&lt;br/&gt;Greg hops into the company jet and takes off for Jackson Hole, where Tish is staying in her vacation home. These are no ordinary firefighters, you see, these are Hellfighters, men who extinguish burning oil wells. Tish reluctantly agrees to come to Houston and shows little emotion for her gravely injured father. At the same time, Greg is feeling the situation acutely, and lashes out at Tish for her lack of feeling.  At this point everyone who has read [i]Pride and Prejudice[/i] knows that Greg and Tish will get married, it is just a matter of how they will overcome their initial dislike for each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Family Reunites &lt;br/&gt;They arrive and meet Madelyn, Tish's mother and Chances' former wife. While we are waiting to see if Chance will live, (like anyone could kill off John Wayne in a movie) we learn that Madelyn still loves Chance. In the back story it turns out after Tish's birth, Madelyn decided she could not live with the dangers inherent in wild well firefighting, the exact risks that Chance thrives on. They agreed to a divorce and Madelyn raised Tish on her own, explaining Chance's crusty behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love as Hot as a Wild Well Fire&lt;br/&gt;Chance and Madelyn have never really moved on from their divorce and are still in love. Since this is John Wayne, you know he will get his girl.  It also turns out that Greg is pretty much like Chance, thriving on risk and adventure while Tish is like her mother and attracted to just that kind of man. Showing the same impulsiveness as her parents, Tish and Greg marry as quickly as they can get Chance out of the hospital. Can they live happily ever after? Can Tish avoid the worry and loneliness that drove her parents apart? More importantly, does the audience really care? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things Can Only Get Worse&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately by this time no one really does care. Tish's main job from this point is to follow her husband to unconvincingly filmed &quot;exotic&quot; and dangerous locations. She is given nothing better to do than stand around, look uncomfortable and try to stay out of the way while the men tell her she should be at home. Then as if to prove a point, the Communist guerrillas attack on cue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poor Katherine Ross, after sparkling as Elaine Robinson in [i]The Graduate[/i] with Dustin Hoffman, she is dumped into this preposterous role opposite the dull Jim Hutton. [i]The Hellfighters[/i] embodies what [i]The Graduate[/i] had so successfully satirized just one year before. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a magnetic key holder placed on a busy downtown street. The spot is near the the building that hosted board meetings for an oil company featured in the film. That building is a few blocks west at 550 Jefferson but this intersection provided a better view. From this location, if you cross Louisiana Street and look north east up the street, you will see two of the building that were prominently visible from the board room. The easy to recognize Humble Oil building (now ExxonMobil) is partly obscured to your right. Several blocks up Louisiana to Polk Street is the mostly obscured former Sheraton Lincoln Hotel. The old building is not much to see as it has been abandoned for years. Not really visible from behind the old Sheraton is the Tenneco (El Paso) building. Both the ExxonMobil and El Paso buildings house the successors to the companies resident there when [i]The Hellfighters[/i] was made in 1968. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The location of this cache is near the site for building used in [i]The Hellfighters[/i] as the headquarters of the Buckman Company.  The movie showed some potential as a John Wayne action film but wound up being a dull potboiler. The story is so bland it should have been called [i]The Heckfighters.[/i]  For the full review see [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=69770b2b-e0e0-4ae5-b640-1feebd9f6360]On Location: Hell Fighters (Downtown Houston)[/url]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original building is no longer standing and I located the approximate site by matching up the locations of several skyscrapers downtown.  The cache is a little south of the building site because of the proximity of other caches.  Park on Sabine Street and you will get the great view of downtown that made this attractive as a film location, although there are many more buildings that were there in 1968.  You can easily see the two of the three prominent structures from the film, the old Humble Oil building (now ExxonMobil) and the former Houston Lighting and Power headquarters (Houston Public Works)  The Tenneco building (El Paso Corp) is hidden by the green glass walled Wells Fargo Bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The El Paso Building is a creation of one of the most prolific designers of skyscrapers in world, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.  It is an &quot;exoskeleton&quot; style with the frame sitting several feet outside the windows with ledges for each floor.  This design was used in many buildings to provided shade to the long banks of windows.  Some years later mirrored glass came into use and the curtain wall became more popular, leaving these buildings as markers for the time they were built.  The El Paso building is a handsome example of the style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a camoed bison tube on Sabine Street near Allen Parkway.  Like many urban locations, this area has plenty of muggles.  With a little stealth you should be able to sign the log without attracting attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to jjax12 for being FTF! </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Just over the wall near the seperation.  Look for a camo string in the vines.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Paris, Texas is a 1984 film by German director Wim Wenders, with a script by the great Sam Sheppard, that tells the story of a disaffected loner seeking to reclaim something of the family he left behind.  It is notable for its visual depiction of the Texas landscape and climate mostly seen though the journey of the protagonist, Travis Henderson.  Paris, Texas, itself is never shown, even the photo that is used to represent the town was really taken in some other location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The film was widely acclaimed and won the Palme d'Ore and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.  Roger Ebert lists it in his reviews of Great Films.  It stars the amazingly beautiful Nastassja Kinski as Jane and the handsomely homely Harry Deans Stanton as her husband, Travis.  In the back story, their brief marriage produced a son, Hunter, but Travis had become increasingly alienated from the  happiness offered him by a family and sinks into jealousy and rage before the despair at what he has become drives him away.  Hunter becomes a victim of this collapsing family and goes to live with Travis' brother in California.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story starts some years later when Travis is found mute, wandering through Texas.  He is trying to get to Paris, Texas, his former home, to find who he is.  After being rescued, Travis is taken by his brother to California where he is reunited with his son.  Somewhat recovered, Travis then travels to Houston with Hunter and to find Jane.  She works siting behind a glass panel while male patrons talk to her from a dark booth separated by a glass window.  Travis enters the booth and starts to tell her a story of a man who mistrusts and mistreats his beautiful young bride.   This confuses her until she realizes it is her story at which time she also realizes who must be behind the glass.  Then Travis tells her of his reason for being there.  I'll stop at this point rather than spoil the ending.  The film is available from Netflix and is well worth watching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The film employed various outdoor locations in downtown Houston, including the former Texas Commerce Bank (now JP Morgan Chase) drive-in bank branch at 212 Milam near where the cache is placed.  Other buildings include the DoubleTree Hotel at 400 Dallas and a parking garage at 1100 Smith. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lynchburg Ferry&lt;/b&gt; is
a ferry across the Houston Ship Channel in the U.S. state of Texas,
connecting Crosby-Lynchburg Road in Lynchburg to the north with the
former State Highway 134 and San Jacinto Battleground State
Historic Site in La Porte to the south. The 1,080 feet (330 m)
crossing is the oldest operating ferry service within the state of
Texas. It carries automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians for free.
Harris County has operated the ferry continuously since 1888.
Ferries depart daily approximately every 5-10 minutes, beginning at
4:30 a.m. (04:30) and operate through 8:15 p.m. (20:15) and have a
maximum capacity of 12 vehicles. The service averages between
approximately 1,500-2,000 vehicles per day. The service has two
ships in its fleet, both completed in 1964 by the Todd Shipyard.
The ferries are named in honor of former the Texas governors
William P. Hobby and Ross S. Sterling. A third ferry with a
capacity of 9 vehicles dating from 1937 is available on standby if
needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be careful to avoid the
poison ivy vines around this cache and carefully hide the cache
back so others may enjoy the hunt. Also, there is a bit of trickery
here to discourage muggles. Don't let it fool you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Aimee31gifts for her first ever
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. Thank you and
happy geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed in honor of [i]Sugar Hill,[/i] a 1974 low budget blaxploitation horror movie. Filmed in Houston but set in an unnamed place in Louisiana, the only easily identified landmark was the Heights Library a block or so north of the cache.  The location was used with almost no attempt at plausibility as the Voodoo Museum and Research Library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of focusing the most controversial stereotypes of a genre that frequently portrays urban blacks as pimps and drug dealers, [i]Sugar Hill[/i] presents blacks as hard workers fighting white oppression.  Filmed on a low budget with a cast of TV character actors and unknowns, the acting was is reminiscent of TV dramas of the period, stiff and overly serious.  The blaxploitation plotline, stereotyped characters, stilted scriptwriting and wooden TV style acting sets this movie completely to its time with no hope of transcendence.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opening scene anchors the plotline and reveals the low budget production values.  A black guy owns a successful nightclub where black entertainers put on a Voodoo show for the white patrons.  A white mafia boss wants to buy the club but the owner won’t sell, so the boss sends in his henchmen to beat the owner to death.  The racial theme is made clear through the thugs’ vile jeers shouted at the owner as they kick him while he is on the ground.  The low budget meant there was no dummy to use as a stand in, so the actors could be seen kicking the pavement next to the guy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The owner’s girlfriend Diana Hill, a woman so sweet she is known as “Sugar” now owns the club. The murder transforms her to a woman with a single minded focus on revenge.  Helpless on her own, she seeks out her ancient grandmother in a rundown mansion in the swamp, who just happens to be a Voodoo Priestess.  Together they walk deeper into the swamp to an old slave cemetery where Sugar’s passion for revenge is sufficient to call the Voodoo Lord of the Dead.  He gleefully agrees to use his power to exact her revenge in exchange for Sugar’s promise of her soul when all the whites are dead.  Then on cue, his army of slave zombies rise from their graves, machetes in hand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From here the audience is treated to each thug dying in a uniquely horrible way measured to the level of his racism. The gruesome deaths are mostly off camera to save expenses.  In the end the gang boss, who is not particularly racist, gets the easiest treatment by getting pulled down into the swamp to drown. The worst punishment goes to the bosses jealous, vengeful and hatefully racist moll when she is taken alive by the Lord of the Dead into the underworld, to serve him forever.  The moll also serves as temporary payment for Sugar’s debt of her own soul.  With the revenge complete, Sugar can now get on with her life.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any lover of campy movies will have to put [i]Sugar Hill[/i] high on the must see list.  It is available from Netflix instant view. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Today, the weather was beautiful. I had just been getting an FTF with MOS and georeynosos, and she volunteered to help me find this cache because it was hard to find. We made the short walk over, and she &quot;helped&quot; me find the cache. I know that I would have never have found it without her help.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bison tube only, so BYOP. Nestled along the piney hardwoods of Jesse H. Jones Park &amp; Nature Center's Cypress Overlook Trail. Access through front gate only during regular park hours (park closes at 5 p.m. in Dec. and Jan., at 6 p.m. in Nov. and Feb., and at 7 p.m. Mar. to Oct.). Enjoy the park's 7 miles of trails, interpretive nature center (open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily), playground, picnic tables, boardwalks, white sand beaches...the list goes on, so make a day of it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty is a 2.5 due to the fact that the coordinates jump around a bit under the forest canopy. The abrupt downslope at the park entrance brings you into a floodplain forest; in fact, the nature center building is on some of the highest ground in the park, yet it was still inundated by a flood in 1994! Proceed north along the Canoe Launch Trail, stopping for a moment at the Cypress Overlook pond. The resident turtles have already sensed your approach, and have been moving toward the overlook deck to greet you for a snack, hoping you have acquired turtle food at the Nature Center. The second entrance to the Cypress Overlook Trail will lead you in the correct direction. Along the way, take note of the cypress trees and their characteristic 'knees' which line the banks of the pond. Small alligators sometimes take up residence here for brief periods. Near the west end of the pond, you will enter the domain of an old and venerable magnolia tree. This species has reportedly existed in North America for 95 million years. Before the existence of bees, pollination was thought to have been accomplished by beetles. Examine this 'aristocrat' of trees. Note the resurrection fern on the trunk, with leaves that are withered and brown during dry periods, and then reborn to lush green after a rain. Examine the trunk's horizontal woodpecker holes, indicating a Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker of yore. The tiny holes yielded sap, which attracted insects, and then enlarged as the trunk enlarged. Huge four-petaled white blossoms adorn the magnolia's canopy, yet are seldom seen fromthe ground. Birds seek the bright red seeds when they are ripe. Each bloom and seed pod creates a miniature biosphere for myriad insects and other invertebrates. Whether or not you find the cache, stop for a moment and look around if the mosquitoes allow. Resist the urge for a quick 'Grab and Go.' Reflect briefly on the mysteries of this wonderful land. Attach this part of the park to your DNA. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will be looking for a Tupperware container covered in black tape. Please be sure to sign the log and if you take something, leave something in its place. Please only take a Travel Bug if you know how to log it on the site, this way they don't go missing. Hope you like my very first cache!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache placed in memory of the severe forest fire that occurred here on June 17, 2011. Log and pens, and a bit of swag and lots of extra HoustonHerp pens to get the ball rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area was devastated by a severe forest fire on June 17, 2011. The fire was so dangerous that the Texas Forest Service was called in to assist numerous area fire departments who responded to the blaze. Since this fire was less than 0.3 miles from my house, it gave my family and I quite a scare; in fact, during the afternoon, we even had a TANKER plane dropping flame retardant on the fire! Fortunately, no buildings were damaged and no one was injured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are standing at GZ and look to the northwest, you will see one of the areas that was hardest hit; scorched stumps and trees are all that's left of a once-thriving forest. However, this is still a living ecosystem, and new herbaceous plants, then shrubs, and finally trees, will slowly repopulate the area. If you visit this cache, I hope you will take the time to take a photo of the area to the northwest. It would be great to post pictures as time goes by to show how this once forested area recovers from the great 'Birnamwood Burn of June 17, 2011'.</groundspeak:long_description>

No longer appropriate for them besides fond memories, we decided to place a cache in the vicinity for others to add one more element to enjoy about the place.  Seeing the many trails and foot traffic, we decided to not be so direct to help stave off muggling.  Geocaching is just another way the three of us have bonded together, and so we chose this neighborhood for a quick pick and smiley.</groundspeak:long_description>

Same container as UC #8 and #9. BYOP and a removal tool as well.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Behind Sadler Clinic, now no more
rests a micro cache, on nature's floor
In the V of a small shrub sits the stash
You just have to find your way there to nab the cache</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This is a micro. It contains only a log, so BYOP. Use stealth to avoid muggles driving down the road or walking their dogs. Keep a sharp eye out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;you may need a removal tool!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Urban Caching series is a group of caches scattered around the urban areas in Conroe, Tx. This series consists of caches ranging in size from nano to small, and in a broad spectrum of difficulty suitable for beginners and experienced cachers alike.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you enjoy Urban Caching, and I look forward to adding more and more caches to the series as time goes on. Feel free to message me with any feedback, questions, or concerns.&lt;br /&gt;

This is a small two piece tube. it opens by rotating one end while holding the other stationary. It contains only a log inside, so BYOP. You may need a tool to remove the log.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stealth is almost absolutely required for this one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Please log all DNFs!&lt;/i&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Addition &amp; subtraction, 
together they make quite a reaction
some people love them, some hate them
but for this cache, using them will give you a hint
that's painted on the pavement.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Small, cube shaped container. Bonus points if you can guess what was previously in it. &lt;br /&gt;
Beware of snakes &amp; thorns, especially around GZ. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This cache uses natural camo from the surrounding environment.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to make sure everyone has a good experience, please replace the cache exactly as found. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

After the last two, an easier difficulty was required. For my sanity and yours &lt;br /&gt;
Same container as #15 and #16, but should be much easier to find! BYOP &amp; a removal tool.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy Urban Caching, and I look forward to adding more and more caches to the series as time goes on. Feel free to message me with any feedback, questions, or concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is meant to be very difficult. It is a micro, you will need a pen and a removal tool. &lt;br /&gt;
The terrain is very overgrown, with knee high weeds and plants. &lt;br /&gt;
Be very aware of snakes, stinging nettles, chest high thorns &amp; vines, sinkholes, and other poisonous plants and animal life. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also ran across what looked to be a makeshift campsite, so be aware of strange and dangerous human life as well. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;NOT recommended for children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This one doesn't even need a poem
When you find it, you'll know it. 
Search for twin pines, each wrapped in vines,
Spy the green top, and your geocache hunt will stop.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Remember that the park closes at 10pm.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This old bridge, built in 1909 according to the signs that used to be above each end, is another very interesting site. It would be a beautiful area if people didn't dump old appliances, like is so often the case out in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not completely under the bridge. It is a &quot;Cell Phone Dry Box&quot; and has small swag and a log.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Please bring something to write with as there is a log sheet but nothing to write with in the cache.***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be careful when looking for the cache, as there is definitely poison ivy and possibly snakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bridge is now closed to traffic.  You are able to access the cache without walking clear out onto the bridge.  Little children actually might have trouble walking on the bridge, it has a very open grid and their feet might slip in one of the holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep an eye on little children so they don't fall off the bridge. The cache is not meant to be hard to find, it is meant to be a fun family cache, but please keep safety in mind!  I'd be very cautious about taking little kids clear out onto the bridge. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Southeast corner. This cache has a $5 gift card to Starbucks in it.  I am only posting gift card info on OX! Please take it if you find it and let me know so I can remove this.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I thought we would drive on through to The Old Bixby bridge, but this bridge is closed so we had to turn back here and find another route.  The attaching devices have come unglued.

Make sure nothing blocks the water-proof seal when you latch it shut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****No pencil or pen is in the dry box!!!  Bring something to write with!****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an old bridge blocked with wooden barrier posts. The main road used to go to the bridge, but it bypasses it now and the old road is a good place to park on the northside .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be on the look out for possible broken beer bottles. Also, watch out for snakes, spiders, poison ivy. Hopefully you'll see some cool wildlife, like tarantulas and lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch young children carefully...don't let them fall off the bridge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think it would be difficult to get a wheelchair or stroller onto the bridge, due to the barrier posts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not meant to be a difficult cache to find. No need to do anything dangerous, like climbing over the bridge rails!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a picture of the bridge.  Last time I was out there, it had been cleared off considerably.  There were also less beer bottles, which tells me that may be why they cleared it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d58/2jedismom/Bridge.jpg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look around at how beautiful Oklahoma is!    </groundspeak:long_description>

The Coordinates seemed off by about 40'.  Could be from the origional hide.  SL, left a Pathtag and grabbed the drink card.  Thank you!</groundspeak:text>

                          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very easy family-oriented cache. Cache contains lots of goodies that will change frequently. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; This cache is owned by Riverview Baptist Church and is located on church property.  Some items in the cache are simply letting you know what our church has going on, but most of the swag is family-oriented fun stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
Terrain is very easy to navigate on foot.  The only difficulty is there are cacti and stickers.  These can be avoided for the most part but do not wear sandals or flip-flops!  Watch for sandy areas to step on.  Toddlers should be carried so they don't trip and fall into a sticker or cactus, but there is a relatively sticker-free area near the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Efforts will be made to clear a way through the stickers sometime in the future when it's not 100+ degrees outside!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Strollers and wheelchairs would have a very hard time due to the soil being so sandy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Area is monitored at night by law enforcement.  Please don't &lt;br /&gt;
try to access cache after dark.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This cache is often gone through and items stolen. The one thing the person doing the stealing never takes is the Bible.  Inside the Bible is a gift card from Riverview.  Please take it and let me know when you do so I can replace it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Do not attempt this cache if there is any possibility of there being rain. Do not attempt this cache if a particularly large rainstorm that has occured recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be required to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Be able to climb a bit (nothing terribly difficult though)&lt;br/&gt;2. Do a bit of heavy lifting. A partner or two will help here.&lt;br/&gt;2. Hike about 4-5 miles (assuming you're going there and back)&lt;br/&gt;3. Have special equipment including:&lt;br/&gt; - at least 3 GOOD flashlights with FULL batteries (if going alone), 2 or more per person if in a larger group (In fact, I very highly recommend you do this cache in a group)&lt;br/&gt; - Waterproof shoes, galoshes, or shoes you don't mind getting wet in&lt;br/&gt; - Clothes you aren't particularly fond of&lt;br/&gt; - GPS (goes without saying)&lt;br/&gt; - Snacks (I recommend it, but please do not litter)&lt;br/&gt;4. Don't attempt this cache if there is ANY rain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is NOT suitable for young children. Please do this cache in a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, tell someone you will be out looking for this cache before you leave home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alright, now that I'm done with all the warnings, let me reiterate:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT attempt this cache while it is raining or if there is any possibility of there being rain. You have been warned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now to business. Before I forget, this cache was hidden with some help from my good friend, Seth. This mystery cache starts in Centennial Park, however, the cache is NOT at the posted coordinates. Once you have reached the posted coordinates, you will need to do a bit of heavy lifting and downward climbing. If there is more than several inches of water, I recommend saving this cache for another day. Otherwise, head Southwest. Have fun, and don't expect your GPS or cellular devices to work while you're down there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have reached the other end, you can start searching for the cache. It will be located just outside. I recommend hiking back overground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please reread everything I've said twice. I know it's boring, but you don't want to miss something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Edit --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It looks like my hiding skills weren't good enough, because the original has been muggled (I suspect it was a hobo). I've replaced it with a smaller cache at a different location. The hint has changed and I've upped the difficulty. And I forgot to add a pen so for now please bring one till I can go back and add one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find it, please replace exactly as you found it so it doesn't get washed away. Thanks!</groundspeak:long_description>

Be careful during the weekdays becuase students may be milling about or going from class to class. Also be aware that parking in the wrong place could get you a parking ticket from the campus police. A stop inside is definitely recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McFarlin Library was opened in 1929 to address the needs of an expanding school. The library was expanded in 1967 and 1979, the latter adding a sunken courtyard surrounded by three stories of study areas and book stacks. You will be able to see this sunken courtyard in the middle of Albert Plaza as you go to seek your cache.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The characteristic rocks in the Chautauqua Hills are the thick
sandstones that cap the hills and are exposed along creek and river
valleys. Sandstone, which is made up largely of quartz grains
cemented together by calcium carbonate, iron oxide, or silica, is a
common sedimentary rock. In eastern Kansas, sandstone is often
interbedded with shale and limestone. It also occurs as channel
deposits, cutting through older deposits of shale and
limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sandstones capping the Chautauqua Hills are the Tonganoxie
Sandstone Member of the Stranger Formation and Ireland Sandstone
Member of the Lawrence Formation. Both are thick rock formations,
the remains of deposits that filled a large, ancient river valley
during the Pennsylvanian Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sandstones are marked by ridges and troughs that look like
the ripples you'd see in loose sand in a stream, shallow lake, sea,
or sand dune. By studying ripple marks preserved in sandstone and
comparing them with similar marks found in today's sand, geologists
can make shrewd assumptions about what the environment was like
when these sandstones were deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the area you will see numerous sandstone outcroppings
that are a unique feature here in Kansas and it gives one a feeling
of being in the Ozarks instead of being in Kansas. Marker # 2 along
the trail is at one such outcropping and is the location of the
earthcache coordinates listed above. There are a total of 15
markers along the trail and you will need to bring a canoe or
kayak, or inquire at the front gate about using one of the 5 kayaks
the state park has just for those that want to paddle the water
trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging requirements, email all answers to the email on my
profile page:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What is the blue marker # 2 attached to at the cache
location. Is this a geologic feature, or biologic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Estimate the size of the Sandstone outcropping near marker #
2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What is marker # 6 attached to, is this geologic or
biologic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Take an elevation reading at the cache location and send me
the reading you get. I will use this to monitor lake level
differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy and be safe paddling on the lake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;102HE4Z - Marker 10&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.974 W 095° 55.730&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;112HE4Z - Marker 11&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.922 W 095° 55.811&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;122HE4Z - Marker 12&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.898 W 095° 55.884&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;132HE4Z - Marker 13&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.828 W 095° 55.966&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;142HE4Z - Marker 14&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.714 W 095° 56.156&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;152HE4Z - Marker 15&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.637 W 095° 56.142&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M12HE4Z - Marker 1&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.503 W 095° 56.321&lt;br /&gt;Boat Ramp - launching point&lt;br /&gt;M22HE4Z - Marker 2&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.435 W 095° 56.279&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M32HE4Z - Marker 3&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.504 W 095° 56.146&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M42HE4Z - Marker 4&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.607 W 095° 56.082&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M52HE4Z - Marker 5&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.642 W 095° 56.045&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M62HE4Z - Marker 6&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.718 W 095° 56.038&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M72HE4Z - Marker 7&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.761 W 095° 55.943&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M82HE4Z - Marker 8&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.904 W 095° 55.810&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M92HE4Z - Marker 9&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 46.963 W 095° 55.713</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Chautauqua Hills are a sandstone-capped rolling upland that
extends into the Osage Cuestas from the southern Kansas border.
Approximately 10 miles wide, these hills extend as far north as
Yates Center in Woodson County. Small patches of similar terrain
can be found as far north as Leavenworth County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chautauqua Hills formed primarily in the thick sandstones of
the Douglas Group. During the Pennsylvanian Period, about 286
million to 320 million years ago, rivers and streams flowed into
the sea in this area. Sand and other sediments collected in the
estuaries and at the mouths of the rivers in deltas. Over time, the
sediments were buried and compacted--the sands became sandstone and
the muds became shale. Over millions of years, uplift and erosion
exposed the sandstone and shale at the earth's surface. Further
erosion has dissected the area into a series of low hills, capped
by more resistant sandstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of rock outcrops in this region, the hills are generally
not cultivated but are used instead for pasture. The Verdigris,
Fall, and Elk rivers cross the area in narrow valleys walled by
sandstone bluffs. Topographic relief in the region is never more
than 250 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the hills are covered by stands of black jack oaks,
scrub oaks, and other hardwood species. This mix of medium-tall
grasslands and scattered stands of deciduous trees is called the
Cross Timbers by scientists who map vegetation. In Kansas, the
extent of the Cross Timbers is almost identical to the extent of
the Chautauqua Hills physiographic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging requirements, email me the answers to the
following:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Find the information board and tell me what percent of the
old growth forest is made up of trees that are older than 250
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Give a reason why the geology of the area would keep the
trees from growing as big as other old growth forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Take an elevation reading at the coordinates and tell me what
direction you are facing while reading the information board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting my earthcache and happy hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to madmallard on the First to Find.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Melvern
Riverfront Park &amp; Trails offer over 5 miles of wooded hiking
along 10 trails. You'll be able to see native grasses and plants,
timber, river bottom ground, and wetlands. The trail is 6-ft wide
and is surfaced with lime screenings. Parking, bathrooms, and a
pincic area are near the trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You will be looking for a specially-painted, themed .30cal ammo
can, well hidden off of the trail a short distance. Please be sure
that if you intend to take an item that you also place an item in
the cache, so that it does not get depleted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 At the time of this placement, we did not see ticks, thorns,
snakes, or poison ivy - but this is Kansas, and as we all know,
stuff changes seasonally&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Havana Stage Station, Osage County,
Kansas – Built in 1858, the ruins of the station and hotel
are found 4 miles west of Burlingame along the Santa Fe
Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Havana Stage Station was built
in 1858 and was a mail stop on the Santa Fe trail offering meals
and lodging until 1869.  At 130 yards behind the sign (and
cache) are the remains of the hotel and stage station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About fifty German and French
families settled here.  The large stone hotel was erected: a
large distillery and brewery were started.  Soon the leading
merchants failed and the town was abandoned in the early
1870's.  Many of the Germans moved to Alma and the property
was sold for taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic site sign was erected
by the Burlingame Chamber of Commerce and the Flint Hills Chapter
of the S.F.T.A.  Down the road to the west there is an area
were you can still see ruts from the Santa Fe trail. There is a
marker along the road indicating where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please DO NOT cross the fence to see
the ruins up close.  You will be trespassing!  Cache is
reachable from the public right of way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;A small rural cemetery in Douglas county
Kansas.  Cemetery caches are some of our favorites so we set
out to find them all in our county.  Not all that we've found
so far have been cache friendly but still one fit the bill. 
I've been trying to find information on these places but some of
the older almost forgotten ones I can't find much.  This is
one of them.  Hope you enjoy discovering these places as much
as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always please be respectful and a pull off for
parking can be found on the east side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to StealthRT

&lt;p&gt;You are looking
for a 1x1x2 micro cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stony Point Church built in
1883, by the Eberhart family and community members, was used until
1900 when either or both the preacher Rev. D. Scholl retired, was
transferred or the congregation's population was too low to support
the reverend. The board decided to close and lock the doors with
hope of sporadic use. According to 92 year old Herschel Hemphill,
whose grandparents donated the north property, only one service was
held in 1938, on the 55th anniversary of the dedication of the
church. Only occasional funeral services or annual picnics have
been conducted in the church since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stony Point School was where the
Eberharts as well as other fellow Lutherans met for religious
services. On Sunday, October 10th, 1868, David Earhart (The
Reverend David Earhart was a well known Lutheran minister that
traveled to several Lutheran settlements for services. David
Earhart is the grandfather of Amelia Earhart, the famous female
pilot of the 1930s.) He reported at a meeting, that a motion was
made and carried &quot;to appoint a committee to secure, if possible, a
piece of land for a church and congregational farm.&quot; Before the
meeting adjourned it was suggested that some plan be adopted for
securing a church and a cemetery site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places in 2006.  As always be
respectful and make sure you shut the chain link fence gate behind
you.  No need to move or disturb anything.  If I see
people are having a hard time finding I've add a
hint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to TeamSNOOTH,
Hockabee, and Larry739 for FTF!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Calling this one good today.

After being First-To-Find on June 30th, 2009...  on the letterbox with a fresh log that was only feet away from the cache, I was required to delete my online log.  Today I am calling this one found, though clearly the First-To-Find will never be.  Oh no, that First-To-Find was snagged out of my clutches by the evils of the stamp box and the fact that hockabee, larry739, and TeamSnooth had The Ravens on speed dial.  When they also had found the letterbox first, they suspicioned something was awry and made the call that forced the deletion of the First-To-Find I had driven all day to get.  Who gets a First-To-Find 16 days after publication.  Hockabee, larry739, and TeamSnooth, that’s who!

My log was not the only one that had to be deleted.  Woodland Clan also was deterred from continuing the search by the letterbox, whose only signature when he found it was mine.  He also followed suit.  I know what you are thinking.  The question was asked.  Can the blind lead the blind?  Will they not both sign the letterbox.  OK, maybe that is the loosest paraphrase of Luke 6 you’ve ever heard, but…

Now it may seem that I’m frustrated by that turn of events.  Truth is, I’m not.  What is striking to me is that only a couple months later the six of us all were all together in canoes doing some team island caching.  That’s geocaching for you.  Well, that’s geocaching for some of you.

All that history being said…  what a cache.  Truth is, I’m not sure if I loved or hated the location.  I think hated.  Seriously, I burned more time here trying to decide where to search.  My gps kept trying to take me where I did not want to waste anytime searching.  Stupid gps.  I respect the hider…  I might even respect the hide…  but, if I had just walked away in the first place, I might respect myself more.

TFTC…  sorta.

&lt;p&gt;This cache series is dedicated to
area Cachers.  Caches have been placed by association either
by their name, likes, dislikes, cache types/placement, and/or their
notoriety.  Some may be just a place I thought they might
enjoy visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batman17 is SmilingBee's
sidekick/partner in fighting muggles in order to sign logs all
across the land.  I met Batman17 out at Riverfront Park while
looking for one of Smilingbee's caches hoping for a FTF log. 
Since then, all of us, have become good caching friends helping out
each other and sometimes placing caches with the intent of
retaliation of the others previous placement by testing each others
skills, endurance, and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batman17, I've been looking and
thinking about this cache placement for sometime now.  Sorry
that it's been a long time in coming.  Being the geographical
region we live in this is the best I could do.  I S!O wanted
to place this cache in a 5/5+ cave out in B*E, hee hee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on,
Smilingbee, to the Bat Cave! There's not a moment to lose! -
Batman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF Prize: Non Activated FTF
Geocoin, Hatpin, The Ravens Sig Nickle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Terrain close to and at ground zero
is loose rock and can be &quot;slippery when wet.&quot;  BE
CAREFUL!!  Also, you might not want to attempt this cache
after heavy and/or excessive rainfall.  If you do, choose your
route wisely.  There is a runoff ditch nearby and looks like
it has had significant water running through it at times. 
Have fun! Be safe!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Batman17
     for FTF on his cache!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache series is dedicated to
area Cachers.  Caches have been placed by association either
by their name, likes, dislikes, cache types/placement, and/or their
notoriety.  Some may be just a place I thought they might
enjoy visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campcreekers is the first geocacher
I ever met.  Consequently he is the one responsible for my new
addiction... I mean hobby.  This cache is named after him for
his help getting me away from the computer on weekends and for all
the good times the Raven family has geocaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for things to use on
this cache page I stumbled upon the reason for Campcreekers
nickname on this
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/ks/swissvale.html&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;. 
With that information I've placed Stage One on Camp Creek (I
think?).  Please go to web link and read about Swissvale, Ks.
and the people that lived there.  It's another tidbit of
Kansas history that we would not have known if it wasn't for
geocaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage Two is one of Campcreekers
favorite cache containers... one Grade &quot;A&quot; U.S. Decon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FTF Prize:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Came within inches of banging my head on the side of the van.  My hands prevented that.  It was a result of grass being tall enough that I didn't see the small ditch and the misstep threw me off balance.  But, a quick jump up with my arms in the air exclaiming &quot;I'M GOOD!  I MEANT TO DO THAT!&quot; and everything was okay.:tongue:</groundspeak:text>

county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Raven and I decided to seek out all the
cemeteries in Douglas county since we like these places and enjoy
finding caches in them.  About half of the sites we've visited
so far were suitable for placing a cache.  Some of our
favorites are ones like this place.  Being an old not well
known cemetery it's hard to find anything to post on a cache
page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always respect the site and enjoy an out of
the way place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Note: Copperheads have been seen near site
site so please be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

A few days after my attempt, Woodland Clan came out and discovered some copperheads.  I had been flying solo that day, so it might have been bad news for me had I went after this cache like I normally did back then.  Full steam ahead would be an apt description of how I would normally attack a cache like this during those days.  

Today, I came back out with a group and we were able to track the cache down without incident.  Thanks for the cache, The Ravens.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is a lot of history in Vinland. This cache is meant to give
you a reason to take a quick break and explore some of this
history.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
You can see the cache in this picture. It's right there. Can you
find it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will find three locations of note that are in very close
proximity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At N 38 50.419 W 095 10.967, you will find a prominent sign that
will give you information about one of the buildings in Vinland
that is on the National Register of Historic Places, the Vinland
Presbyterian Church. The church was erected in 1878. Not only that,
but the Vineland Presbyterian Church once was pastored by James
Naismith, the founder of basketball. During those years, Naismith
also worked at KU as chaplain.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
At N 38 50.418 W 095 10.994, you will see a marker dedicated to the
establishment of the Vinland Valley Aerodrome. You will also be
able to see the Vinyard Vally Aerodome which is still in operation
today. Depending on when you are here, you may get to see one or
more planes flying very low overhead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, at N 38 50.406 W 095 10.973, you will see another building
on the National Register of Historic Places, the Coal Creek
Library. This is the oldest library in the state of Kansas. I
imagine this library also holds the record for the oldest
librarian. Martha Smith has been became the librarian in 1926. She
just retired this year (2011) at the age of 106. The library has
limited hours, but is open seasonally on Sundays between 1pm and
4pm.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
There was a great spot for this cache that seems obvious, but
reportedly has extreme poison ivy seasonally. Hence, the final
resting place for the cache avoids that spot. Please to not park on
North 700 Road to retrieve the cache. There is plenty of parking
available by turning south onto East 1719 Road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is modeled after the methodology of The Raven’s
Country Cross series. Thanks to buzzkill2 for supplying the cache
container. Thanks also to Paul Caviness for his dedication to the
community and help with this cache.  </groundspeak:long_description>

What is it with me and FTFs in the rain lately? Thanks for placing a cache so close to Lawrence. It's not to often that I can go grab a cache after work on a week day. Had a hard time see this one. Well camo'd... almost called ya.

&lt;p&gt; A good sized rural cemetery in
Douglas county Vinland, Kansas.  Cemetery caches are some of
our favorites so we set out to find them all in our county. 
Not all that we've found so far have been cache friendly but still
one fit the bill.  I've been trying to find information on
these places but some of the older almost forgotten ones I can't
find much.  Hope you enjoy discovering these places as much as
we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always be respectful will

south of Lawrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Raven and I decided to seek out all the
cemeteries in Douglas county since we like these places and enjoy
finding caches in them.  About half of the sites we've visited
so far were suitable for placing a cache.  Some of our
favorites are ones like this place.  Being an old not well
known cemetery it's hard to find anything to post on a cache
page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always respect the site and enjoy an out of
the way place.  It's okay to open the gate and drive up the
tree lined lane.  Just make sure you shut the gate behind
you.  Once you make it to the open meadow stay along the north
fence and then turn left at the west fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to irsusan
     for FTF&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

second FTF... or Co-FTF as it was. We are very glad to have met you

Unless you want to go wading across it and climb a decently steep bank, you'll have to use a cable bridge to get there. Please use your best judgement when attempting this cache. When I placed this cache, the creek was completely dry. This was only due to the extreme drought in the summer of 2012. This creek normally has some depth to it -- enough to warrant placing a cable bridge over it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The De Soto Wilderness Park is a cool place to visit when you want to get away from civilization. There's almost never any other people around, so I like to go here when I'm feeling like being a hermit. If you've got an ATV, there are some trails around the area that are great for driving around on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two pennies in the bottom of the tube to help remove the log. If the log becomes stuck, let me know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have permission to place caches here from the parks and recreation director of De Soto, KS. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.desotoks.us/Pages/park.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.desotoks.us/Pages/park.htm&lt;/a&gt; for details.</groundspeak:long_description>

F. Overfield&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This cache is
dedicated to my Great Great Grandfather John F. Overfield and in
response to Campcreekers' &quot;Drop Zone Challenge Cache&quot;
(GC1BKT7).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; John
Overfield, born Feb. 19, 1862, was the first white child born in
Wakarusa township and a Kansas State Senator from Montgomery Co.,
Ks.  He also drilled the first oil well in Oklahoma.  His
father, Thomas Overfield, settled close to Lawrence along
Washington Creek, which this cache has been placed.  Thomas
moved his family from Salem, Massachusetts to the then Kansas
Territory to insure our state was inducted free to all men and for
that I'm very proud.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Below is a
biography of John F.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;transcribed from volume III, part 1 of&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;John F.
Overfield&lt;/b&gt;.—While at the present time Mr.
Overfield is best known as the president of the Denver Alfalfa
Milling &amp; Products Company and as state senator from the
Independence district, as well as one of the strong financial men
and pioneer oil producers of Kansas and Oklahoma, yet, he has won
success in other fields of activity and has had a business and
political career filled with years and honor. Mr. Overfield was
born at Lawrence, Kan., Feb. 19, 1862, son of Thomas and Margaret
(Ferguson) Overfield. His father was a native of Birmingham,
England, and resided in his native country until his twenty-fifth
year, when he came to the New World to seek his fortune. He first
located in Massachusetts, where he met and married Margaret
Ferguson, who was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and remained there
until her twenty-fifth year, when she emigrated from the old
country. She settled at Salem, Mass., and there married Thomas
Overfield. They came west and located at Lawrence, Kan., in 1854,
being members of those brave free-state colonists who left their
homes in the East to assist in the admission of Kansas to statehood
free from the stain of slavery. Mr. Overfield took up a farm near
Lawrence, and as the territory was inhabited chiefly by Indians he
began to trade with the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes for furs,
which he shipped east. This industry grew to a considerable
business before the Territory became well populated, and Mr.
Overfield was regarded as one of the prosperous pioneers. He was
thoroughly imbued with anti-slavery ideas and was ever ready to
help advance the cause of freedom and free government. He lived to
the hale old age of eighty-four years before passing to his last
rest, in 1909. Mrs. Overfield still lives at the age of eighty. She
reared a family of seven children—six sons and one daughter—all of
whom are living. John F. Overfield was the fourth child and third
son, and his boyhood days were spent near Lawrence, until his
eighth year, 1870, when his parents removed to Montgomery county,
where Mr. Overfield had taken up a homestead, which is still in
possession of the family. The lad grew up healthy, strong, and
resourceful, as are all boys who had to endure the hardships and
privations incident to frontier life in Kansas, and secured an
education in the log cabin schools of the early days. After
finishing the elementary schools at Independence he was sent by his
father to the Kansas State Agricultural College at Manhattan for
two years, and then to a commercial college in Independence for a
business course. Soon after leaving school he engaged in the
mercantile business in Independence, but gave it up to accept a
better opportunity as traveling salesman on the road, which
occupation he followed ten years. He had natural business ability
and desired to engage in some enterprise where he would be able to
invest capital in a business of his own. With this end in view he
left the road, in 1896, and invested in oil properties in Oklahoma,
being one of the pioneers in that field, as he drilled the first
well in that state. He soon made a name for himself, and was
engaged by Michael Cudahy, of Chicago, to look after the Cudahy
interests in Oklahoma, and he has held the position ever since,
still having control of the Chicago packer's many oil wells.
Besides being owner of several oil wells, he is the president and
general manager of the Denver Alfalfa Milling &amp; Products
Company, with three big mills located respectively at Hartman,
Bristol and Wiley, Col., all in the Arkansas valley irrigated
district, each mill having a daily capacity of from eighty to 100
tons of alfalfa meal. Mr. Overfield is a stanch supporter of the
Republican party, having from the first been a loyal upholder of
its principles, with an unwavering faith in the ability of its
leaders in state and nation. He has always taken an active part in
local politics, served in the city council of Independence and in
1908 was elected state senator from the Twelfth district of Kansas
for a term of four years, a position which he is filling with
dignity and to the entire satisfaction of his
constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 1, 1887, Mr. Overfield was
united in marriage with Clara J., daughter of William H. Rhodes, of
Freeport, Ill., and they have five children—Gilbert H., Earl R.,
Majory, Clara, and Katherine. Mr. Overfield is a Mason, a member of
the Modern Woodmen of America, the United Commercial Travelers, and
the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, No. 780. He is a
lifelong Kansan, being the first white child born in Wakarusa
township, Douglas county, and by reason of his own efforts,
industry, integrity, and capability has forged his way to the front
rank in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This cache was
placed with permission from land owner so please respect his
property!!  He is also a game warden for the Kansas Department
of Wildlife and Parks so don't mess with the
rabbits!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cache container
is a .30 cal ammo box.  The shoulder of N1200 Rd is nice and
wide for parking.  Please watch for
traffic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandparents used to live in the
house to the south on the corner before moving to Oklahoma and
Texas.  I'm surprised a cache hadn't been placed here knowing
the popularity of cemetery caches.  We like them!  Zero
PITS!  Unfortunately this one is not the case.  As always
please respect the resting and have fun caching!&lt;/p&gt;

BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landon Nature Trail is a rail-trail being developed on 38 miles of the former Missouri-Pacific Railroad from Topeka, south, to Lomax Junction, east of Pomona Lake in Osage County.   This historic 123 year old &quot;Mo-Pac&quot; rail corridor was originally built in 1886 by the Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota Railroad.  It is now being developed under the National Trails Act, Rail-Trails Program, as a trail and wildlife area open to the public for non-motorized use. Visitors are invited to come out and enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, running, and horseback riding.  It is a wonderful place to walk the dog and pursue a healthy lifestyle for the whole family. The route also comprises the major north-south artery of the Topeka City Trail System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find more info at www.Landontrail.org</groundspeak:long_description>

BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landon Nature Trail is a rail-trail being developed on 38 miles of the former Missouri-Pacific Railroad from Topeka, south, to Lomax Junction, east of Pomona Lake in Osage County.   This historic 123 year old &quot;Mo-Pac&quot; rail corridor was originally built in 1886 by the Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota Railroad.  It is now being developed under the National Trails Act, Rail-Trails Program, as a trail and wildlife area open to the public for non-motorized use. Visitors are invited to come out and enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, running, and horseback riding.  It is a wonderful place to walk the dog and pursue a healthy lifestyle for the whole family. The route also comprises the major north-south artery of the Topeka City Trail System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find more info at www.Landontrail.org</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;A small
park in the Park Hill neighborhood.  These small parks are
tucked away on the back streets of Lawrence and unless you live in
these neighborhoods you would never know they were there.  I
happened upon this one while exploring Lawrence when I first moved
back here in the '80s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LPR didn't have a web page for this
one. Amenities are playground equipment, basketball court, and
maybe some picnic tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you guys enjoy this Lawrence
park series as much as I enjoyed seeking them out.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache - Redux&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just off the walking path, should be an easy
find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Stormy's Cache!  Stormy and his master
MissAlum walk the trail regularly and he asked me to place a cache
for him... so we did.  This ammo box started off with 3
LiveStrong wristbands, 2 Koozies, a luggage handle plus a first to
find prize, a geocoin and a travel bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trees and leaves can mess with your GPSr so
don't give up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE:
This cache is a replacement for Stormy so area caches can still
enjoy a walk down the path Stormy loved.  Stormy and his
master moved to Texas and have given permission to replace this
cache in Stormy's name.  This should be considered a new cache
for you cachers that have logged the old one so go ahead and come
enjoy the trail again and log your find.  Parking co-ords have
been posted.  Be careful crossing the street.  Sidewalk
is on a somewhat blind corner.  New container is a 4x5.5x4
Lock-n-Lock filled with new swag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
This cache is located within Naismith Valley Park, a part of the
Lawrence Parks &amp; Recreation Department park system. For general
information please call 785-832-7920 or visit our website at
www.lprd.org. All parks rules and regulations
apply.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landon Nature Trail is a rail-trail being developed on 38 miles of the former Missouri-Pacific Railroad from Topeka, south, to Lomax Junction, east of Pomona Lake in Osage County.   This historic 123 year old &quot;Mo-Pac&quot; rail corridor was originally built in 1886 by the Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota Railroad.  It is now being developed under the National Trails Act, Rail-Trails Program, as a trail and wildlife area open to the public for non-motorized use. Visitors are invited to come out and enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, running, and horseback riding.  It is a wonderful place to walk the dog and pursue a healthy lifestyle for the whole family. The route also comprises the major north-south artery of the Topeka City Trail System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find more info at www.Landontrail.org</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This micro cache is placed within Clinton State Park at Clinton
Lake Lawrence&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; Ks.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;No Motor Vehicle fee is required&lt;/b&gt; if using
parking co-ords:  &lt;b&gt;N38 56.543&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;W095 22.352&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt; which are 200ft. North of cache.  I also recommend
that you &lt;b&gt;DO NOT BLOCK GATE.&lt;/b&gt;  I'm not sure if it's used
much but you never know.  If you would like to come from South
the hike is a more considerable distance and a $4.20 fee will be
required during Prime Season months 4/1 through 9/30.  Off
Season fee is $3.70.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Barber Schoolhouse,&lt;/b&gt; located within the Clinton
Reservoir Recreation Development of Douglas County, was constructed
in 1871-72 by Solomon B. Geary, builder, at a cost of $600. The
walls are constructed of roughly dressed yellow/brown limestone,
while the cornerstones and sills are of a light grey limestone. The
schoolhouse, named for Thomas Barber, one of the first anti-slavery
martyrs in Kansas, is an excellent example of the one room
schoolhouse tradition. The structure is further representative of
the stone vernacular architecture popular in Kansas during its
early history. The school remained in operation until 1946 and
there is a record of 21 students attending school there in 1898.
During its last year of operation it was attended by only 2
students.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Douglas Co. schools.&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of a series of four themed caches that will lead you to
a finale at the end of the rainbow! Each of the Altoids containers
has been hand-painted by Mama Wood to highlight the thematic nature
of this series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to complete the &quot;Geo-Skittles&quot; series you will need to
find each of the four and record the code number located in each
cache container on a laminated card.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE NUMBER CODE CARD FROM THE CACHE!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lemon flavor will have you headed out to the DeSoto area to the
Sunflower Nature Park, near the closed Sunflower Ammunition Plant.
There is a lovely paved trail that will bring you to within feet of
ground zero with very little need to bushwhack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is enclosed in a ziploc baggie to help protect it
from the elements. Please insure the baggie is sealed, once you
have found and signed the cache. Also, please be sure that the
cache is well wedged into its hiding spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

BYOP for this one!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The park at 19th and Haskell Sts. is a 5-acre plot of land
developed in the 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The park originally was going to be named for firefighters because
of its proximity to the fire training facility, but the name was
not approved by the City Commission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Additional development took place in the 1990s to create the
shelter and update the playground. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION OF THE PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Next to Lawrence's fire training facility, the park at 19th and
Haskell Sts. offers an inside look at how firemen train for their
job, as well as a break from the busy world that surrounds
it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This park has plenty of open space, shade trees, playground
equipment, and a basketball court. A covered shelter with picnic
tables is also available. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The amenities of the park include: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Basketball Court&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playground Equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picnic Tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SHELTERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is one shelter located in 19th &amp; Haskell Park. It
available for use on a first-come/first-serve basis, and is not
available to be reserved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The amenities of the shelter include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electricity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Just down the river about .8 miles is the mouth of the Wakarusa at the Kaw aka The Kansas River.  This is also the site of the last Wakie river access before the Kansas. When the water is low, like it was when I placed this cache, you can see pilings under the bridge from the old wooden bridge replaced decades ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This place may not have the interesting folklore or geological features as the original cache site, but to the local kids of my age and older this place hosts many memories of girl friend make outs and break ups, fist fights and late night street parties, good times and bad times alike.  This place even has ties to when my wife and I started dating those many years ago.  I could go into detail but it's a bit embarrassing... to her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We call this place.... &quot;The Boat Docks&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

This 23-acre plot of land was created in two parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1961, the City bought 16-acres of land from Moore Land Inc. to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1953, the City purchased 2-acres on which to create Water Tower
Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This park is named for its position at the base of a water tower.
It was developed in the early 90s, when playground equipment was
added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION OF PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sitting at the base of a water tower, this park is located in the
neighborhood bordering campus. Water Tower Park is often the
location of pick-up games of football, soccer and basketball due to
is wide open space and the close proximity of both fraternity and
sorority houses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The amenities of the park include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playground Equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shelters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are no shelters located in Water Tower Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lawrence's first oldest park, South Park was part of
the original 1854 town site. In the original town plat, South Park,
located on Massachusetts Street, covered eight city blocks and was
divided evenly into four separate parks - Lafayette Park, Hamilton
Park, Washington Park and Franklin Park. The bandstand, or the
South Park gazebo, was erected in May 1906.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On August 31, 1910, a crowd of 6,000 citizens and visitors attended
a formal dedication of the Roosevelt Fountain, the granite display
fountain. President Theodore Roosevelt was present at the ceremony,
arriving by train at the Santa Fe station in Lawrence. The fountain
was originally located at the intersection of New Hampshire and
Warren (now Ninth) Streets, because of its proximity to a livery
stable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, with increasing automobile traffic, the fountain's
location soon became unpopular after many dented fenders. The
fountain was moved to Robinson Park in 1929, just west of
present-day City Hall, with the promise of protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1965, the Lawrence Flower Club member, celebrating their 40th
year, petitioned the city commission and parks department to move
the forgotten fountain to a site in South Park. Later, a rose
garden was created in South Park by Robert Rankin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fountain needed cleaning and restoration by 1982, and, once
again with the request of the Lawrence Flower Club, the fountain
was restored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION OF PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A historic component to Downtown Lawrence, South
Park has traditionally been a place for people relax and play.
Located in the heart of beautiful Downtown Lawrence, the rich
tradition of South Park is held as Lawrence's premiere meeting
place. Spread out across Massachusetts Street, South Park is
divided into two areas with distinct atmospheres.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
East of Massachusetts Street features the William Kelly Bandstand,
which is a popular place for special events, weddings, parties, and
the home of the Lawrence City Band's Summer Concert series. This
side of the park also includes the Roosevelt fountain, picnic areas
and flower gardens. Trees line the walkways throughout the park,
and benches offer relaxation and tranquil areas for visitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The West side of the park is full of playground equipment, swings
and slides for children's enjoyment, with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/aquatics/spwp&quot;&gt;South Park Wading
Pool&lt;/a&gt; nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Children may also enjoy and learn from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lprd.org/_parks/pdf/butterflygarden07.pdf&quot;&gt;Butterfly
Garden.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/recreationfacilities/sprc&quot;&gt;South
Park Recreation Center&lt;/a&gt; is also located on the west side of
Massachusetts Street. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/recreationfacilities/cb&quot;&gt;The
Community Building&lt;/a&gt; also resides north of the west side of South
Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
West of Massachusetts Street also has large open areas that are
used for public events. This active side of South Park is often
filled with visitors and outdoor activities and is the perfect area
for a family picnic or to toss around the Frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Events that annually take place in South Park include: Art in the
Park, the Parks and Recreation Fall Arts and Crafts Festival and a
host of other events.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The amenities of the South Park include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The William Kelly Bandstand &lt;em&gt;(east side)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theodore Roosevelt Fountain (east side)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flower gardens(both sides)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lprd.org/_parks/pdf/butterflygarden07.pdf&quot;&gt;Butterfly
Garden&lt;/a&gt; (west side)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playground equipment(west side)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picnic tables (both sides)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SHELTERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are no shelters located in South Park, but the
William Kelly Bandstand (gazebo) is available for
rent.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">William Seward Burroughs II, also known by his pen name William Lee, was an American novelist, poet, essayist and spoken word performer.  A primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author, he is considered to be &quot;one of the most politically trenchant, culturally influential, and innovative artists of the 20th century.&quot;  His influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote 18 novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians, and made many appearances in films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trail is named after him after quite the controversy.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The late Myra B. Hobbs, a resident of Lawrence, left in her will
approximately $70,000 to the City of Lawrence. The money was to be
used specifically to purchase land for the purpose of creating a
city park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In her will, Mrs. Hobbs directed the City of Lawrence to purchase
land existing &quot;east of Massachusetts Street at a location between
6th Street and 15th Street.&quot; She also expressed the park should be
named to honor her late husband, Earl Hobbs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hobbs Park lies where a City garage (a Quonset hut) once stood at
10th and Delaware Sts. The Quonset hut was converted into a
neighborhood recreation center; until it was torn down to make park
renovations from the bequest of Myra Hobbs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hut served as a neighborhood center until &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/recreationfacilities/elrc&quot;&gt;East
Lawrence Recreation Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/parks/edgewoodpark&quot;&gt;Edgewood
Park&lt;/a&gt; was constructed in the mid-70s.&lt;br /&gt;

Also included in the park is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/recreationfacilities/municipalstadium&quot;&gt;
Municipal Stadium.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION OF PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hobbs Park is home to a softball field, also known as Municipal
Stadium. In addition, a playground area is available for children,
along with a picnic shelter and basketball court.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Murphy-Bromelsick house, also known as the John Speer Farmstead
Site, is located in Hobbs Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Somehow, we missed this one earlier so we decided to make up for it by going after it now.  A bit of searching uncovered this one.  However, it was when we realized we had been muggled that the real fun began.  As RC signed the log, he spotted a nearby visitor.  A quick examination realized that we had actually muggled it.  The baby rabbit was in high stealth mode, not moving an inch other than it's eyes as it followed us.  After replacing the cache, we moved on and left it to it's own search.  It was interesting how adult rabbits will bolt when we humans approach and this baby one just sat there as we trounced around it.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landon Nature Trail is a rail-trail being developed on 38 miles of the former Missouri-Pacific Railroad from Topeka, south, to Lomax Junction, east of Pomona Lake in Osage County.   This historic 123 year old &quot;Mo-Pac&quot; rail corridor was originally built in 1886 by the Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota Railroad.  It is now being developed under the National Trails Act, Rail-Trails Program, as a trail and wildlife area open to the public for non-motorized use. Visitors are invited to come out and enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, running, and horseback riding.  It is a wonderful place to walk the dog and pursue a healthy lifestyle for the whole family. The route also comprises the major north-south artery of the Topeka City Trail System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find more info at www.Landontrail.org</groundspeak:long_description>

When we finally found a spot to park and got to this, we quickly discovered that this area seems to be a common bathroom spot.  We took turns searching as we each needed a break from the stench.  Finally, with the help of a makeshift tool, I found this one.  Signed the log and replaced, happy to walk through the scentless humidity instead.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oregon Trail settlers once used the land now known as Centennial
Park as an area to graze livestock as they traveled west. Numerous
individuals have owned this land, most notable was Jes Williard, a
professional boxer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In celebration of City of Lawrence's Centennial in 1954, school
children across the City of Lawrence donated toward the purchase of
the land on the western edge of town that would later be become
Centennial Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Subsequently, the land was sold to the City of Lawrence by the
schoolchildren for $1 and represented a gift to the City in
celebration of its 100th birthday. In the purchasing agreement, the
school children and City officials understood that the land would
be utilized as a public park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION OF PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Located between 6th and 9th Streets; Iowa Street and Rockledge
Road, this 35-acre park today is one of the most centrally located
parks in Lawrence. The amenities of the park include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/recreationfacilities/discgolf&quot;&gt;An
18-hole disc golf course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 12,300 sq. ft., lighted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/recreationfacilities/skatepark&quot;&gt;Skate

&lt;li&gt;Children's playground area&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Open areas for multiple use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centennial Park displays a Polaris missile that was constructed
during the Cold War.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With its rich history and amenities, it continues to be a popular
destination for families and individuals and is one of the most
beloved parks in the City.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Named in honor of the late &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/parks/watsonhistory&quot;&gt;Buford M.
Watson Jr.,&lt;/a&gt; Lawrence City Manager from 1970-1989, this park was
originally known as Central Park. . Incidentally, Central Park was
part of the original town site when Lawrence was founded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watson Park serves as a &quot;gateway&quot; for visitors to the City of
Lawrence from the north, west and eastern proximity of Downtown
Lawrence. The renaming of Watson Park was dedicated on March 27,
1990.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION OF PARK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The seven-acre park, located in the Old West Lawrence neighborhood
adjacent to downtown Lawrence, is one of the most popular
destinations for Lawrence citizens to visit. Watson Park is home to
the Lawrence Outdoor Aquatic Center, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lprd.org/art/parks/photos/watsonpark/watson3.jpg&quot;&gt;an
original train locomotive,&lt;/a&gt; playground equipment, and basketball
court.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, there is a picnic area along with a gazebo that allows
visitors to relax and enjoy the scenic park. Throughout the summer
months, Watson Park is a popular gathering place for families and
friends to enjoy the open space in this highly visible two-block
park, which is separated by 7th Street.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most popular attractions of Watson Park is locomotive
#1073. Built in 1902, it was used in freight service in the
Lawrence from 1908-1952. The 2-6-2 Prairie type locomotive traveled
over 870,000 miles and originally cost a little over $20,000. The
locomotive is located on the northeast section of the park; many
children refer to this park as &quot;train park&quot; because of the
locomotive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watson Park also is home to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/aquatics/oac&quot;&gt;the Lawrence Outdoor
Aquatic Center,&lt;/a&gt; which was renovated in 1995. In October 2003, a
bronze bust was unveiled in honor of the park's namesake, Buford M.
Watson Jr. The artist was Tom Wilkerson, former assistant director
of the Lawrence Parks and Recreation Department.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stone sculpture &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lprd.org/art/parks/photos/watsonpark/watson9.jpg&quot;&gt;&quot;Emergence,&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
created by Edd Ortiz was added to the park in September 2003.
&lt;em&gt;Emergence&lt;/em&gt; was a product of the Kansas Sculpture
Association's Stone Symposium, which was held in Lawrence in the
2002. The sculpture was accepted as a gift by the Lawrence City
Commission in June 2002.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The amenities of the park include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basketball Court&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking Fountain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playground Equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawrenceks.org/lprd/aquatics/oac&quot;&gt;the
Lawrence Outdoor Aquatic Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Watson Jr. Park&lt;/b&gt;, a part of the Lawrence Parks &amp; Recreation

&lt;p&gt;You read in the
Bible of the prophets of old... how to become a seer, a prophet,
one had to bury himself alone in the woods. Your old Scotch bards
would often bury themselves in the mountains... I wanted to become
a Seer so I buried myself here in the woods. Some day the vision
may come.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                                                                                                                                    
Hugh Cameron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Wonderful Old Lawrence&quot; by Elfriede
Fischer Rowe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...... Hugh Cameron came to Lawrence in July, 1854,
but lived to age 81 and so came into the generation that had
dropped the style of 1854. He was a free-state man and decided to
come to Kansas where the action was. He is listed as a farmer in
Andreas History of Kansas, 1883. His place was three miles north
and west of Lawrence, on the south side of the Kansas River, and
was designated as &quot;Cameron Bluff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     He was born in New York state.
Some dropouts might be interested to learn he did not go to school.
He was self-educated. He did a good enough job of it, too, became a
professor of mathematics at the Rittenhouse Academy in Washington,
D. C. He didn't get to stay there too long as he was fired because
he was linked with a close friend who was a radical. Later he
&quot;canvassed&quot; for Harper's Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     From there he came to Kansas. When
the Civil War broke out, he enlisted and served two years in the
2nd Kansas Cavalry and came out a captain. He then served four
years in the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry and came out a Lt. Colonel. In
later years he was brevetted Brig. General of Volunteers for
Meritorious services. He was called by many, &quot;General Cameron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The Hermit was a walker. All
through the years, he walked to Washington to attend every
inaugural ceremony. He had important friends in Washington. Webster
and Clay were intimate friends. Politically, he was usually on the
side of the minority. He printed a journal called &quot;The Useful
Worker&quot; which was devoted to sobriety, equality and equity. As a
writer, his style was bold and aggressive, and according to his
contemporaries, these traits characterized his career in life. The
journal did not last long. He also was a strong
Prohibitionist.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Lecompton and Topeka, Ks.  This section is also called the
Kansas Capitol Trail.  A few hundred feet to the East, looking
NW from the bluff is a great place to take pictures of the Kansas
River. I suggest sunset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get full tour of this area I suggest using E500th Rd just
1/2 mile west of Lecompton to Shadden Rd off of US Hwy40
.&lt;/p&gt;

Topeka State Hospital Cemetery is over 75 years old. Less than a
dozen grave stones are visible, yet the cemetery contains 1,157
burials.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Burial sites are found by locating the row, you can see the row
markers looking northwest from the cache site. There is also a
newer memorial listing all the names of those buried here.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The Topeka State Hospital began in 1875 and was known as the Topeka
Insane Asylum until 1901. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
In 1888 Boston Corbett, who killed John Wilkes Booth, escaped from
the Topeka Insane Asylum, where he had been confined since February
1887 and was never seen again.&lt;br /&gt;

Picked this cache up as part of the caching I did surrounding my attendance of Nicooole and Royalsfan’s Moose Pancakes 2011 event.  The pancakes were amazing and so were the people who attended.  The event gave me the opportunity to do some great caching in Lawrence and Topeka.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This cache series is dedicated to
area Cachers.  Caches have been placed by association either
by their name, likes, dislikes, cache types/placements, and/or
their notoriety.  Some may be just a place I thought they
might enjoy visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flo was one of the first cachers my
daughter and I met on a find.  She exhibited her expertise
(LUCK!) of a seasoned cacher to our dismay and insisted we log a
CO-FTF online.  Thanks Flo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this location while
following Garmin on a Saturday cache run.  I wonder how long
this old structure will last and what it has seen over the many
many years it's stood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Hockabee for
FTF!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Thank you Sir!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your an area cacher you'll know what the subject mater of this cache is.  Co-ords were taken in the middle so you'll just have to look around for it.  I s!oo wanted to place a nano here!  But instead you have a nice big cache to look for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trail head is marked by blue stakes next to 94th St. east of Ferguson Rd.  Take trail to the 15 mile marker and then head off into the timber at the &quot;double blue&quot; marked tree (about 270 ft from cache).  Trail is rocky at first and can be slippery when wet or icy so be careful.  Approach to cache can be the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed this after my 1300th find..  WOOO HOOO!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;TH2270Z - OMT Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 12.977 W 095° 24.871&lt;br/&gt;Trailhead and Parking</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This long, lonely
stretch of highway needed some cache placement to induce more folks
to travel along it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I found a decent pull-off at a four way intersection as well as a
likely hiding spot and planted a cache &quot;darn near nowhere.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hopefully it will help folks seeking the KS Delorme challenge or KS

the dead-end barriers. (approx. 300+ feet)
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This Pony Express Station has sources indicating it was located
within the town of Troy. A monument in the northwest corner of the
courthouse lawn notes the existence of the relay station. Some
authors list the monument's location as the possible site of the
station, but later research links the station with the Smith Hotel.
Leonard Smith arrived in Troy in 1858 and purshased the Troy Hotel.
Two years later, at the request of the Central Overland California
&amp; Pikes Peak Express Company, he constructed a barn large
enough for five horses. The renamed Smith Hotel served as a relay
station and was located at the present northeast corner of First
and Myrtle Streets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a micro with room for log, pen, and a few small coins or
swag. A $ gold coin is also in the cache for a FTF Prize.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Headin' West!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**NOTE**&lt;br /&gt;
This cache listing is a qualifyer for the &quot;Pony Express Trail
Challenge&quot; of mine. Photo of you and the Pony Express horse/rider
or a photo of you and the Pony Express marker by the courthouse
will work for this Kansas station.&lt;br /&gt;

Lou, keeps saying she wished she had seen the snake.  BULL, I've been out caching with her enough, she would of threw down her gps and ran like a big baby, had she seen it.  Instead me and Pax were being really wise and sticking our cameras down in the snakes face to grab a good photo.  I think he was watching over MoPirate's caches to make sure muggles wouldn't mess with it :)

Yes there were deer spotted, a little Jeep incident, a tow truck, a couple state troopers, some local po po at the hotel and parks, some severe weather changes, a strange rest area, some misidentified animals, some uncontrollable laughter, a couple conversations with cows, and many many great caches. Most importantly there were no injuries to cachers, deer, or Jeeps. Thanks for being a part of a more than memorable caching expedition.

Quick and easy find. Orale! and TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Yes there were deer spotted, a little Jeep incident, a tow truck, a couple state troopers, some local po po at the hotel and parks, some severe weather changes, a strange rest area, some misidentified animals, some uncontrollable laughter, a couple conversations with cows, and many many great caches. Most importantly there were no injuries to cachers, deer, or Jeeps. Thanks for being a part of a more than memorable caching expedition.

Frozen in place and frozen shut. After a little defrosting the log was in hand. Orale! and TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Glad to have one more rest stop cache to get on the way home from Kansas City. GuitarMan24 and I ran over to ground zero and made the find after a very short search. Hint was helpful... signed the log and ran back to the car. Quick stop and a nice park and grab for us today... thanks!

I have found all 13 of the REAL CRYSTAL SKULLS, but have left them hidden until mankind is ready for them to be revealed.  This is the first of the Crystal Skulls!

This one came up on us quickly after crossing the bridge, so we drove past it just a bit before pulling over. Started checking the guard rail, but then quickly corrected my course with the iPhone GPS. Started looking around and wondered if the difficulty and terrain were accurate on this one, but then spotted the container on the ground. Bigger than I was expecting... a nice container. Lots of muggles driving by, so we didn't dally too long... signed the log and got back into the caching mobile. Thanks for the quick park and grab!

Cool cache container, indianaschmidt! This one's better than the first. :-)

As I was scanning for where we should park, we blew right past this one. Mr.coupleofbucks pulled over and backed up to within 40 feet of this one. As I jumped out and looked toward ground zero, I spotted the cache. Grabbed the container and brought it back to the car to sign the log and make some trades. As Mr.cob points out, the hinge seems a little bent or something, but I was able to get the cache back pretty much as found. Thanks for the quick park and grab to add to our totals for today, nice hide!

It's Not a Peanut Butter Jar!!!(but it's no longer a micro, either!) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I once said that I would never hide a micro...This was my only one(heh heh heh, it's not a micro anymore!).  The other night I picked up a GeoCoin, with honorable intentions of sending it on it's merry way.  I went to it's page, read it's goal...&quot;NOOOOOOOOOO!!!&quot;  It's goal is to be hidden in a NEW MICRO!!! I was tempted to quietly put it back in school cache (where someone dropped it without logging it, the cowards!), but decided it needed to be on it's way, planting it's evil micro seeds everywhere.  Should be easy for all of you micro hunters to find, so you're not getting any hints (except maybe the name).  FTF prize is an evil Nano.  The evil micro-spawning geocoin is in there too.  (Now that the coin is gone, I've traded this one out for, well, you'll just have to come and see...Hmmmmm [:)])&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to McGator on the First To Find!</groundspeak:long_description>

Driving by this cache with GuitarMan24 before dropping him off at a friend's house. Parked on the street right next to ground zero and after first following one incorrect hunch, GM24 named a cache we found in the Ralston area which was an identical hide to this one. He made the find and we sat down to sign the log before heading out... Quick park &amp; grab for us this evening, thanks!

I had tried for this one once before, but couldn't seem to get it and the muggles kept chasing me off. Came here today with Mr.coupleofbucks to try my luck again. Thought if I got in the right spot I would be able to see it... coordinates had us looking in the right spot. No luck spotting it, so Mr.cob monkeyed his way under the bridge. Just before he made the discovery, we got muggled by three little girls. I started telling them about geocaching while Mr.cob (aka the troll) made the find. Finally it seemed I wouldn't be able to shake my new muggle friends and called to Mr.cob to make sure he was ok. Sure enough he had made the find but I had the pen, so he handed it to me to do the signing. We went into more detail with the girls about the take something, leave something and never move the container. Hope it was enough to convert them from muggles to cachers.

We drive near this site daily and thought it would nice to commemorate the holiday weekend and give some information on a local service organiztion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; On Oct. 2, 1881, a small group of men met in the basement of St. Mary’s Church on Hillhouse Avenue in New Haven, Connecticut. Called together by their 29-year-old parish priest, Father Michael J. McGivney, these men formed a fraternal society that would one day become the world’s largest Catholic family fraternal service organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They sought strength in solidarity, and security through unity of purpose and devotion to a holy cause: they vowed to be defenders of their country, their families and their faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These men were bound together by the ideal of Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of the Americas, the one whose hand brought Christianity to the New World. Their efforts came to fruition with the incorporation of the Knights of Columbus on March 29, 1882.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were Knights of Columbus.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Upon moving into our new home, we noticed something strange
happening each night to our potted plants which we left on the
front porch. They were being disturbed in a manner which made us
think that someone or something was eating parts of the plants.
However, we never could find any footprints to identify who the
culprits were. Eventually, we gave up on worrying about it until we
found out where the culprits were coming from.&lt;br /&gt;

I was surprised that the CO was able to get it back up and running within the hour. What better to do then go out and grab my smiley before it gets muggled again. Why do muggles take things that aren't theirs...especially when it's on someone else's property?! I loved this cache, it was cute. Mini ewok #3 came out with me to find it since he was with me when I tried before. He took the iPhone and lead the way. After he found it I took his photo at GZ. When we walked back to our car the neighbors kitty was there and loved mini. He kept rubbing and purring. Very sweet kitty. What a pleasant caching day, especially since the weather is reasonable warm. TFTC </groundspeak:text>

#3 of 11 for us today. We parked right next to this one and ventured onto private property... coupleofbucks and I wandered too close to the house at first, but GuitarMan24 quickly spotted this really neat hiding spot fairly quickly. Don't know if anybody was home today, but we did find the Gnomebody's Home cache. Creative hide and a fun one for us today.

Needed a quick find today and this one fit the bill. Had just been to GeoKid#3's basketball game south of here and stopped by this cache with GuitarMan24 on the way home. He jumped out and made the grab and I signed from the driver's seat. GM24 replaced the cache as found and we were on our way. Doesn't get easier than this... thanks!

We (the Kid and I) uncovered proof of their obsession with this stuff.  Of course, we left the ancient artifact exactly where we found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area is slippery when wet, so be careful!</groundspeak:long_description>

Big Elk was originally buried where Bellevue University now is; he and his fellow Omaha tribesmen were moved here in 1954 with proper tribal ceremonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearby Fontenelle Forest was named after Logan Fontenelle, Big Elk's grandson and the man who negotiated the sale of tribal lands to the US government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your visit please respect that while there are very old monuments here it is also still an active cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To verify your visit, combine Big Elk's Indian name from the monument (with the dashes removed) with the last word from the top of the memorial bench to give a 14-letter verifier.  </groundspeak:long_description>

This Crystal Skull was discovered and catalogued, then left exactly where it was found, to be studied by future generations. We also uncovered a legend that we believe is tied to this amazing artifact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to cache wyz on the First To Find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story of Ahmou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Ancient times, there was a stone cutter known for his beautifully perfect bricks. From all over the world, temple builders would send messengers to Ahmou of Octotato, as Bellevue was known at the time, to procure the finest square and rectangular blocks to build their sacred monuments with. To say that Ahmou was popular would be an understatement. Its was about this time that the Octotatoian decided that he needed a challenge, so he began telling people that, in his words, &quot;Nuzbh znxr Fgnghr.&quot;  Loosely translated, this was, &quot;I feel I need a new challenge, bricks are becoming too easy to make, so I'm going to build some statues and monuments.&quot;&lt;br/&gt; Of course, his first statue did not meet his own expectations. It was completely angular and had no curves whatsoever. The people of the area, however loved it for it's simplicity and it's strength. He made several very large statues out of all kinds of materials. Wood, Bronze, Quartz, Sandstone, and even Coal were all mediums which he made beautiful, though angular, monuments to the seasons and elements of his time. His fame reached far and wide, and finally he was approached to build something much smaller. &quot;Are you able to fashion, a skull that would represent your people to the 'ones who are searching?'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;He thought about it for only a moment, and then he answered, &quot;Nuzbh pna Znxr fxhyy.&quot; Loosely translated this is...</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>&quot;I will of course make for you a statue that will cause GEOCACHERS to marvel at the skill of the ancient peoples!  They will FIND what they are seeking when they locate what AHMOU has placed inside the BOXES.&quot;

I had tried for this one a few months ago when it was missing. Today, joined by GuitarMan24, I made quick work of it. GM24 led the way over to ground zero and I discovered the suspicious looking pile of rocks. Some nice new swag in the container... we made a trade. Also picked up &quot;Old Logs Wanted!&quot; TB. Always love to find this type of container... thanks for a great hide!

On my way out to pick up GuitarMan24. Had just enough time to try for one more. Lots of muggles around, but I managed to park strategically and slip into the brush unnoticed. Didn't want to cause too much of stir with my search and attract attention. Wasn't quite sure what sort of container I was looking for, so I went to the iPod notes. Read a few logs, then the hint... and that got me right on track. Instant find... grabbed the cache and ducked back into the brush a bit to sign the log and leave a few things. Had to wait for some muggles to pass so they wouldn't see me as I replaced the cache. Glad to get one more smiley on my way out of the park.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Long the least visible member of the Fantastic Four in more ways than one, the once-passive Sue Richards has matured into a formidable and commanding heroine over the years-but it is still her warmly maternal presence that binds the team together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a sudden loss of funding threatened to derail Reed's experimental starship project, Reed urged his pilot, Ben, to join him in making an unauthorized test flight before the project shut down.  Sue and her brother Johnny insisted on coming along as well, wishing to share the risk. The quartet successfully launched into space, but intense cosmic rays penetrated the ship's shielding and irradiated the crew, forcing them back to Earth. On landing, they discovered they had mutated into superhumans, and Sue became the Invisible Girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reed and Sue were finally married-despite a small army of super-villains dispatched to attack their wedding. Sue soon became pregnant with her first child and stepped down from active FF duty. The baby, christened Franklin after Sue's late father, proved to be a vastly powerful mutant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeking a more normal family life again, Reed and Sue retired from the FF altogether to concentrate on raising Franklin, leaving Ben in charge of regrouping; however, Reed and Sue's retirement was short-lived. After teaming with several Avengers to rescue Franklin during the demonic Inferno invasion, Reed and Sue reluctantly agreed to join the Avengers.</groundspeak:long_description>

Since I didn't think I'd be able to get one I was emailing TANZ!! trying to get him to go get the one closest to Bellevue. He was trying to get off base to go get it and I just got dropped off at my car and so I too was trying to meet him there. Soon TANZ!! and I were both heading to the cache from different directions, TANZ!! coming from the east and I coming from the west. He had got there first and was waiting for me. When I was turning on to the street I seen TeamDAAK and 3omahakids vehicles take the wrong street. When I pulled up behind TANZ!! I was about to tell him that we have company when they both zoom around the corner and pull up behind us. We then converged on GZ mob style and omaha kid was able to make the find.

I was the third person in line. After that I had to figure out where could I get a cache without having to go too far. Swanson park! Drove over here and mozied over to try look for the letterbox but I didn't know where to start so I decided to grab a traditional.

The trails are muddy with some snow let on the ground. I had fun taking photos of paw prints, I could only identify the deer prints and maybe a racoon. Ok back to following my iPhone toward the cache. Got close and scanned the area. Found in in the first place I looked. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

GuitarMan24 and I were taking advantage of the 50 degree tempuratures on this winter day to enjoy the trails at Swanson Park and find some caches. There were a few dog walkers out today, but it was a little too wet for bikers. No muggle problems at this cache and I made a quick find using my geosenses once GM24 led us to the correct area. We had just found another Quest for the Crystal Skulls cache and this one was another great hide. Traded some swag, took a photo and moved along.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This fascinating small cemetery is unique enough, being comprised of four smaller contiguous cemeteries in an interesting location. But at the listed coordinates you'll find the grave of Reuben Kulakofsky, who in the early 20th century invented the Reuben Sandwich at the Blackstone Hotel in Omaha. The origin of the Reuben is a matter of some controversy in the history of sandwich invention, but many writers credit the story of the Blackstone and its late-night poker games and the sandwiches created for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fisher Farm Cemetery section features some of the oldest monuments in the Omaha / Bellevue area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hrabik Cemetery section is tiny, as it only has two burials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bnai Abraham Cemetery section is the part that includes the Kulakofsky stone. It also contains a stone inscribed &quot;Congregation of Israel 1962.&quot; Certain Jewish holy books are not to be burned or destroyed, so this is one place where worn-out books of that type are buried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol Cemetery section contains some burials that date back to the practice of interring males in order of death in one row and females in a similar way in a different row, with no way to tell who constituted married couples or families. You'll see many monuments inscribed in Hebrew, with no English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newer sections of this cemetery are active, with current burials, so please visit only during daylight hours, showing respect for the surroundings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To verify your visit, your code phrase consists of the first names from the two stones directly left of Reuben; in lower case letters type the male first name followed by the female first name of these two other members of Reuben's family. It will be a 12-letter verifier. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Quick park and grab in Aspen Park. If you have found other caches in this series, the hide on this one is a bit different. Muggles walk by here frequently... so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab. This is near a baseball field... if there is a game going on, I presume the place could be crawling with muggles... use extreme stealth or come back another time. Bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. The experiment continues... first, the container was proven to be waterproof as long as you replace the lid tightly (please do). Second, they seem to be holding up in the elements, at least for the short term. Next experiment is internal log construction... trying a more secure method of attaching the log to the lid to ensure quick and simple log extraction and to reduce maintenance issues. Let me know if you have any comments/annoyances with these containers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************************* ALUMINUM *************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Number: 13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: Al&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Hans Christian Oersted (1825, Denmark), Wohler (1827)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Latin alumen: alum, an astringent and dyeing mordant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note on Naming: Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name aluminum for the metal, however, the name aluminium was adopted to conform with the &quot;ium&quot; ending of most elements. This spelling is in use in most countries. Aluminium was also the spelling in the U.S. until 1925, when the American Chemical Society officially decided to use the name aluminum instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Aluminum has a melting point of 660.37°C, boiling point of 2467°C, specific gravity of 2.6989 (20°C), and valence of 3. Pure aluminum is a silvery-white metal. It is soft, light, relatively nontoxic, with a high thermal conductivity, and high corrosion resistance. It can be easily formed, machined, or cast. Aluminum is nonmagnetic and nonsparking. It is second among metals in terms of malleability and sixth in ductility. Aluminum coatings are highly reflective of both visible and radiant heat. The coatings form a thin layer of protective oxide and do not deteriorate like silver coatings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Ancient Greeks and Romans used alum as an astringent, for medicinal purposes, and as a mordant in dyeing. It is used in kitchen utensils, exterior decorations, and thousands of industrial applications. Although the electrical conductivity of aluminum is only about 60% that of copper per area of cross section, aluminum is used in electrical transmission lines because of its light weight. The alloys of aluminum are used in the construction of aircraft and rockets. Reflective aluminum coatings are used for telescope mirrors, making decorative paper, packaging, and many other uses. Alumina is used in glassmaking and refractories. Synthetic ruby and sapphire have applications in producing coherent light for lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust (8.1%), although it is not found free in nature. In 1886, Hall in the United States and Heroult in France discovered how to obtain aluminum metal from electrolysis of alumina dissolved in cryolite. Cryolite is an aluminum ore, although it is has been replaced for commercial aluminum purification by an artificial mixture of sodium, aluminum, and calcium fluorides. The Bayer process is commonly used to refine the impure hydrated oxide ore, bauxite, for use in the Hall-Heroult refining process. Aluminum also can be produced from clay, although this is not the most economically feasible method at present. In addition to cryolite and bauxite, aluminum is found in feldspars, granite, and many other common minerals. The oxide, alumina, occurs naturally as ruby, sapphire, emery, and corundum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

He also made two promises to the man buried there:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He pledged always to keep an American flag planted above Jones, believed to be a runaway slave who fought for the Union during the Civil War before dying in Omaha in 1905.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, he vowed never again to let a racial slur cross his lips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suibielski can't fully explain how his life changed after he found the graves of Jones and 56 other black men, women and children in a lost lot at Laurel Hill Cemetery. Somehow, the discovery exhumed a compassion he didn't know he possessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I had some racist views about things,&quot; he said. &quot;Now that I've gotten into this, I've tried to learn more about the times then. It makes me appreciate people of all races, you know. I don't know, it's just different now.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suibielski's quest took a formal step Tuesday. He and seven others interested in his discovery met for the first time and formed the Laurel Hill East Preservation Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was about a year and a half ago when Suibielski learned of the old cemetery, nestled not far from his south Omaha home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laurel Hill is just north of Harrison Street and west of the Kennedy Freeway. Founded in 1865, it's one of the city's oldest cemeteries. More than 7,000 people are buried there, including the grandmothers of Fred Astaire and Peter Kiewit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typically, one or two people are buried there every year, although six were interred in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suibielski said he began &quot;headstone hunting.&quot; One day he ventured down the hill toward the cemetery's east fringe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;It was nothing but trees and weeds and just nasty looking,&quot; he said. That's where he met &quot;Mr. Jones,&quot; as he has taken to calling him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overgrown area didn't even appear to be part of the cemetery, Suibielski said. The words inside a shield etched on the weathered slab read, &quot;Edw'd Jones, 13 U.S.C.I.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When he learned that &quot;13 U.S.C.I.&quot; was short for &quot;13th Regiment, United States Colored Infantry,&quot; Suibielski couldn't get the man out of his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The regiment fought with the Union Army during the Civil War. Suibielski's Internet search revealed that Jones' regiment originated in Tennessee, a Confederate state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He started devouring books written about the black men who served in the Civil War. He deduced that because Jones joined Union forces in a Southern state, he likely was a runaway slave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jeannie Mill, manager of the Laurel Hill board, let Suibielski examine the cemetery's records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They showed that Jones died in 1905 at age 57, which would have made him a teenager during the war. He was married and had lived at 819 N. 27th St., which is now part of Creighton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The documents also revealed that 56 other black people were buried near Jones, but Suibielski found just one other headstone when he searched the overgrown area. In all, the cemetery's records show, more than 160 blacks are buried at Laurel Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But markers identify only a few. Moreover, Suibielski believes that at least four other black Civil War vets were buried in the cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suibielski, a manager at Oriental Trading Co., volunteered to be a caretaker at Laurel Hill. Last spring, he began cutting down the trees and bushes that obscured parts of what old records referred to as the cemetery's &quot;colored&quot; burial grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He started longing for a way to memorialize the people buried there. When he met Creola Woodall through a mutual friend, Suibielski found an eager partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I think it's so interesting that he's white and I'm black,&quot; Woodall said. &quot;His enthusiasm has ignited me. It's genuine and it's sincere, and he really does have a passion for what he's doing.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woodall on Tuesday was named chairwoman of the Laurel Hill East Preservation Association, and Suibielski was named vice chairman. The group's goals include erecting a memorial, applying for nonprofit status, further exploring the cemetery's history and possibly trying to contact descendants of those in the neglected graves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few things excite Suibielski, a 1981 Boys Town graduate, more than the idea of meeting someone related to Jones. He said he can't help being drawn to the man he believes Jones to have been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;He fought for himself, for his family, for his people and ultimately for this country,&quot; Suibielski said. &quot;It's important that all these forgotten people in the cemetery be remembered, especially him. He's really a hero.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not quite the same as some others in the series, but should be a quick find at H.H. Harper Park. Parking is along 48th Street about .1mi from ground zero. There are often muggles about, so be aware of who may be watching before making the grab. Bring your own pen/pencil. The park is closed from 11pm to 5am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of caches all using the same container. The experiment continues... these containers seem to be holding up even through the winter months. How long can these lids last in the elements? Only time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;************** HELIUM ***************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic Number: 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbol: He&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery: Janssen, 1868, some sources say Sir William Ramsey, Nils Langet, P.T. Cleve 1895&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word Origin: Greek: helios, sun. Helium was first detected as a new spectral line during a solar eclipse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isotopes: 7 isotopes of helium are known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properties: Helium is a very light, inert, colorless gas. Helium has the lowest melting point of any element. It is the only liquid that cannot be solidified by lowering the temperature. It remains liquid down to absolute zero at ordinary pressures, but can be solidified by increasing the pressure. The specific heat of helium gas is unusually high. The density of helium vapor at the normal boiling point is also very high, with the vapor expanding greatly when heated to room temperature. Although helium normally has a valence of zero, it has a weak tendency to combine with certain other elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Helium is widely used in cryogenic research because its boiling point is near absolute zero. It is used in the study of superconductivity, as an inert gas shield for arc welding, as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals and producing titanium and zirconium, for pressuring liquid fuel rockets, for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as a cooling medium for nuclear reactors, and as a gas for supersonic wind tunnels. A mixture of helium and oxygen is used as an artificial atmosphere for divers and others working under pressure. Helium is used for filling balloons and blimps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: Except for hydrogen, helium is the most abundant element in the universe. It is an important component in the proton-proton reaction and the carbon cycle, which account for the energy of the sun and stars. Helium is extracted from natural gas. In fact, all natural gas contains at least trace quantities of helium. The fusion of hydrogen into helium is the sources of a hydrogen bomb's energy. Helium is a disintegration product of radioactive substances, so it is found in ores of uranium, radium, and other elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source - http://chemistry.about.com/library/blperiodictable.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting side note on FTF: I placed this cache months and months ago, but accidentally deleted the coordinates from my GPSr. When I finally went back to shoot the coordinates again, I checked to make sure the log was dry and to my surprise, Bill the Bear and Mizz Piggy had found the cache and signed the log! They get honorary FTF honors, but post-publishing FTF is up for grabs. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">04/03/2012 3:26:00 PM - Felt the urge to go caching today so I figured I'd see what shadowchasers was up to. She had some house chores to do but decided to blow it off and come caching with me.

Since we are heading back to Smith park the easiest way was to come around clockwise, which lead us to 48th st passing this cache. Shadowchasers had it already but stopped to let me run out to grab. She strolled with me down telling me a story about the log on this one. I had to laugh because that almost happened to me with cubsfansean's 0. happy day cache. I was looking for a place to hide a cache and came so close to finding their cache before it was even published. But, I ended up deciding not to use that area for some reason. Lol, shows that we all somehow think alike at times.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The southern segment of the Riverfront Trail is also the levee road, used by public works crews. It's part of the citywide trail system and is open to bicycle and pedestrian traffic, but the only safe public access to it is either 10th &amp; Missouri (near this cache) or 2nd &amp; Hickory to the north. NOTE: As of 8/27/12 the section north of 2nd &amp; Hickory is still posted as being &quot;closed,&quot; although cyclists and walkers appear to still use it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter which access you use, DO NOT PARK on or adjacent to the levee road. The trail runs between the BNSF tracks to the west and the river to the east; do not trespass or gain access in either of those directions. Access is only from the north and southern trailheads. Check BIBB#9 for more information about the northern trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;
Another cache in honor of notable Omaha natives, this one highlights the unusual fact that two of the most celebrated screen actors of the 1950s, Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando, were both born here. Although friendly to each other, they were sometimes considered rivals.</groundspeak:long_description>

When I placed the cache I was watching the unloading of new cars and trucks from large freight cars; amazing how quickly they drove the cars off the freight ramps and into parking spots. From here you can get very close to the river, but you can also experience the trains to the west, and on a good day, you'll hear the zoo train from a little further west. It's possible you've never seen the river or the zoo from this vantage point before.</groundspeak:long_description>

So, I loaded Nia the border collie up and decided to go for a bike ride with her. I left the one at the bottom (#6) for a different day and grabbed the two middle ones and tried to finish with #9. While riding to #7 there was two muggle workers about 100ft from the cache. Luckily for me there was a little hill that helped shield me from them. If they looked my way it just looked like I was resting or letting my dog rest.

As for #9 I did look all around and even went to my car to grab a flashlight and looked again. I didn't find this cache, shucks.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The southern segment of the Riverfront Trail is also the levee road, used by public works crews. It's part of the citywide trail system and is open to bicycle and pedestrian traffic, but the only safe public access to it is either 10th &amp; Missouri (near the Veterans Memorial Bridge) or 2nd &amp; Hickory to the north.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No matter where you're headed today, I can confidently assume that this cache will not be on your way there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The southern segment of the Riverfront Trail is also the levee road, used by public works crews. It's part of the citywide trail system and is open to bicycle and pedestrian traffic, but the only safe public access to it is either 10th &amp; Missouri (near the Veterans Memorial Bridge) or 2nd &amp; Hickory to the north. NOTE: As of 8/27/12 the section north of this cache is still posted as being &quot;closed,&quot; although cyclists and walkers appear to still use it. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE: You'll want to study the map for car access!&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the corner of 10th &amp; Pierce and make your way around to 2nd &amp; Hickory. (2nd street is pretty rough; you may want to come south on 5th to Pine, Pine to 3rd, and 3rd to Hickory.) Once you're at 2nd &amp; Hickory and facing the private gates, there's a gravel road that goes south around the fenced area toward the trailhead. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter which access you use, DO NOT PARK on or adjacent to the levee road. The trail runs between the BNSF tracks to the west and the river to the east; do not trespass or gain access in either of those directions. Access is only from the north and southern trailheads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While placing this series of caches, I visited with an employee from the nearby building, and also a neighborhood walker. The BNSF employee helpfully pointed out the trailhead and also recommended where to park, which I marked as a child waypoint. He said NOT to park on or near the levee road / trail, and also not to block the BNSF access roads, and that as long as I did so it should be fine. A city Public Works truck drove past my parked car and entered the road going north, and did not indicate that I was in anyone's way. Of course, your experience may vary, but I left my car at the parking coords for half an hour and biked to the Vets Bridge and back, placing these 4 caches.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> This a redux of a cache I was trying to adopted but the CO never responded and the cache got archived even though it's still there. So, now you have a chance to get this one and you can look into the archived one as well:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=00070209-3726-43cc-a3ff-7a077a087b57&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a nano in a busy area. You don't need to go into the building to get this cache. Please use stealth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on the former site of a morgue for the Episcopalian Church, the Old Pottawattamie County Jail was constructed in 1885 and closed its doors as a prison in 1969. It was purchased by the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County in 1979 and became what is now a museum. The jail is known as the 'Squirrel Cage Jail' because of its unique three-story rotating jail cells. The jail is part of the National Register of Historic Places, and is one of only three remaining Lazy Susan jails. Prisoners were housed in pie-shaped cells, which were accessed by turning a hand crank until the cells lined up with a single door on each floor. Unfortunately, the jail does not rotate any more, and some of the pie-shaped cells have not seen the light of day for almost forty years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building is believed to be haunted by the ghost of one of the former jailers that worked and lived at the jail. While employed at the Squirrel Cage Jail, the jailers and their families lived in an apartment located on the fourth floor of the jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four deaths are known to have occurred at the jail:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) One prisoner died of a heart attack.&lt;br/&gt;2) One prisoner was found hanged in his cell.&lt;br/&gt;3) One prisoner tried to climb up the jail cage to try and write his name on the ceiling. He fell from the third level and died.&lt;br/&gt;4) One was a prison guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to visit the inside here is the information.&lt;br/&gt;2008 HOURS OF OPERATION&lt;br/&gt;April 2 through October 31&lt;br/&gt;Wednesday through Saturday: 10 am to 4 pm&lt;br/&gt;Sunday: 1 pm to 4 pm&lt;br/&gt;Closed Mondays, Tuesdays, and Holidays&lt;br/&gt;Other times by appointment - please phone, write, or e-mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADMISSION&lt;br/&gt;Adults: $7.00&lt;br/&gt;Seniors:(60 and Over) $6.00&lt;br/&gt;AAA Members $6.00&lt;br/&gt;Age 6 - 12: $5.00&lt;br/&gt;Age 5 &amp; under and HSPC Members: FREE&lt;br/&gt;Group rates available </groundspeak:long_description>

Well described on the cache page. Wish I would have read it before. It looked much easier from the road.

Bushwached our way to the cache location. Spent some time scratching our ankles upon exiting the greenery. Nothing poisonous, just temporarily agrivating.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was hoping to hide something larger than a micro here, but
couldn't find a suitable spot for a larger cache. So to make this a
bit more worthwhile I'm giving you a puzzle to solve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you solve the puzzle, you basically have a quick park and
grab, but if you have the time to spare you may spot some wildlife.
Just after hiding this cache a bald eagle flew overhead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Use the code below to get a set of coordinates, however those
aren't the actual coordinates. You'll have to come up with a value
to add to the decimal portion of the minutes to get the actual
final coords. &lt;br /&gt;

fall afternoon and while looking at my GPSr, discovered there was a
spot that was more than .1 mile from any other geocache in the
park! I'm not sure how Essap missed this area, perhaps he left this
opening just so that someone else could hide a cache for him to
find?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just to make this one a bit more difficult, I'm not going to list
any details on the size, shape or type of container. If you've
found many of my caches you probably have an idea of the different
types of containers I typically use which may help. Either way I
don't think anyone will have too much trouble finding this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

hiking/horse trail. Park hours are 6AM-11PM unless you have a
permit or are camping. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is located fairly close to the park road, but do NOT park
along the road. There are two parking locations identified as
additional waypoints, please use these parking areas. The road is
narrow, winding and hilly and visibility for you and other vehicles
would be minimal. Also the terrain if you were to take a straight
shot from the road would be treacherous and you would likely
sustain scrapes and brusies if not a twisted ankle or worse as the
slope is very loose. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will be winter accessible although I'm not sure if/how
often the park road is plowed in the winter. You may need snowshoes
and/or cross-country skis to access the cache in the winter time.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Container is a nalgene style water bottle approximately 3&quot; in
diameter and 8&quot; tall. It is capable of holding smaller trade items
and trackables.

also used by horse riders. Be alert and ready to move off of the
trail if horses come along. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located in Beaver Falls County Park. Park hours are 6AM-11PM unless
you have a permit or are camping. This is a nice little park with a
creek running through it. There are some picnic tables and firepits
scattered around the park. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache should be winter accessible, although snow could pile up in
this area. Also, I'm not sure if the park road is plowed in the
winter, you may need snowshoes and/or cross country skis to get to
the cache in the winter. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache container is 2&quot;x4&quot;x6&quot; not quite a typical Regular-size
cache, but certainly larger than most smalls. &lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located along a hiking/horse trail in Beaver Falls
County Park. Be alert and ready to move off of the trail if you
meet horses. Park is only open from 6AM to 11PM unless you have a
permit or are camping. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located relatively close to a County Road as well as
the Park road, but please do not park on side of either as they are
narrow, twisting roads with hills and parking alongside either
could be dangerous for you and others. Instead please park at one
of the two parking locations below. This cache will be roughly a
.12 mile hike from the closes parking and about 1/3 mile from the
further parking area. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hiking/horse trail will get you within 100' or so of the cache
and then you will need to branch off. In two different spots I
noticed old fences that are beaten down and partially covered, one
of them had some barb wire, so please watch for these and be
careful, especially in the fall when leaves will likely complete
cover them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The entire hike will give you different views of Beaver Creak and
large granite boulders. I hope you enjoy the walk and the scenery
on the way to the cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Container is approx. 1&quot; high with 3&quot; diameter. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will likely be inaccessible once heavy snows settle into
the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No hint unless there are a few DNFs. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting the cache off with a Dragon Dice game, deck of cards,
travel cribbage board, a keychain USB memory stick and a Scout
patch. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've also dropped a travel bug in this cache, it's relatively close
to HWY 212 so maybe this can serve as a local travel bug
stop.&lt;br /&gt;

I tried the two closest geocaches (one about 5 miles away) but all of the recent rains put them in undesirable locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there were no caches around to find without getting soaking wet I decided to hide a cache instead. This hide is a little bit different than the others in my Shopping series, but nothing too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was placing this cache I saw a crane in the nearby pond enjoying the water.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Spent the afternoon on the trail today and searched for a couple of
caches along they way. Found a couple of spots to hide some new
ones as well. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This should be a pretty simple find, and I believe it should be
handicap accessible, as it's a very short distance off of the
trail. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache container is a 35mm film can, you will need to bring your own
writing utensil. Nearest parking is at the Glacial Lakes Trail
Head, near the Willmar High School and the Community Center. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've had reports of Poison Ivy on the west
side of the trail in this area. Luckily, the cache is on the East
side of the trail!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
The Boy Scouts of America in preparation for their 100th
Anniversary in Feb. 2010 recently published the 12th edition of the
Boy Scout Handbook. This puzzle cache celebrates the history of the
Boy Scouts of America and the success that the Scouts who read and
lived by the handbook have had over the years. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you solve the puzzle you will be searching for a camo-taped
peanut butter jar which has a variety of trade items and is capable
of holding most trackables. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cache is not at the posted coordinates!
However, you will need to gather information at the listed
coordinates (Weber Waterfowl Production Area) to determine the
actual cache location.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Cache to Eagle series highlights service projects conducted by
Eagle Scout candidates. This is the second in a series of caches
highlighting Eagle Scout service projects in the Trailblazer
District of Northern Star Council, BSA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This particular Eagle Scout service project was conducted in the
summer of 2009 by an Eagle Scout candidate from Troop 224 in
Willmar, MN. The service project involved more than 270 hours by 21
volunteers and included restoring the large wooden sign at the
south end of the parking lot, designing and placing the three
interpretive signs found at the posted coordinates as well as
constructing the bench and cement walk way at this location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that each &quot;Cache to Eagle&quot; cache has a designated code word,
which is one of the twelve points of the Scout Law. Record this
word for future use as more caches in this series are placed in the
coming months as the Boy Scouts of America celebrates it's 100th
Anniversary!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To Determine the final coordinates for this puzzle
cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1) Visit the Weber Waterfowl Production Area at the listed
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
2) Review the three interpretive signs (and don't forget to enjoy
the beautiful view and peaceful suroundings as well!).&lt;br /&gt;
3) Use the info on the signs to fill in the blanks in these
coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
  N 45 11.ABC W 095 04.XYZ&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A = Sum of all numeric digits on the &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; sign.&lt;br /&gt;
B = # of partners listed on the &quot;Partners are Important&quot; sign, not
including Boy Scout Troop 224.&lt;br /&gt;
C = Last digit of the year that the major effort to restore the
grasslands to this area started.&lt;br /&gt;
X = # of acres originally purchased in 1965 divided by 10.&lt;br /&gt;
YZ = # of acres that are considered Native Prairie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No geo-checker is provided, as you must visit the listed
coordinates in order to gather information. If after you visit the

Chose today for my great Inspriration Peak Adventure. It was way too windy for biking, canoeing or yardwork. Another great day to explore Minnesota. The trip consisted of a First To Find attempt, a State Park (Passport and Wildlife Challenge) a couple Earthcaches, Inspiration Peak itself and this Virtual. WooHoo! Good plan, great day.

Came to Vining to see &quot;The Big Toe&quot;. We were heading out of town before realizing there was a cache back at the intersection here, Nyberg Park. YaaHoo! Made our way back for a quick find, STL and replaced. Went inside the store for a snack and signed their book, too. Thanks for bringing me here. I am a big fan of these type of roadside attractions.

TFTC,

The city sits on a total area of 3.9 square miles&lt;br/&gt;of which, 3.7 square miles of it is land and 0.2 square miles of it&lt;br/&gt;is water and both US Route 71 and Minnesota State Highway 87 are&lt;br/&gt;the two main routes within the city. This should be a nice P&amp;G.&lt;br/&gt;Once at GZ you will see why we picked this location for a cache. We&lt;br/&gt;both had never saw anything like this before and thought we'd share&lt;br/&gt;it with all the other cachers out there. Here you'll be looking for&lt;br/&gt;a Nano sized container, so please bring your own pencil. You will&lt;br/&gt;have to watch for muggles and use stealth most all times of the&lt;br/&gt;year as this could be a busy area. Bring a camera and enjoy this&lt;br/&gt;sight! In the winter months unload your sleds nearby and go for a&lt;br/&gt;ride! Please respect the property when looking for this cache. Good&lt;br/&gt;Luck &amp; Have Fun!!

It also could use a little CITO now and then. I filled up my container and I could have filled up a few more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If trying to access in the winter you may have to hike in from the main road.</groundspeak:long_description>

Both Kim and I hope you'll enjoy it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache takes you into the southwest corner of Clearwater County right off of Hwy. 200. A nice Park &amp; Grab with plenty of off road parking, in the summer months anyways and a short walk to GZ from the Highway in the winter months. You will be looking for a Micro Size cache. There is no reason to damage or upset any property in your search for this cache, you'll see what I mean when you get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is lots of history here.  The house that once stood here is now in Mahnomen.  There also used to be a store here.  This is also right next to a CCC camp.  This was home to hundreds of young men from 1934 – 1939.  It was the Buckboard Camp S 141 CCC number 2705.  It was a drought relief camp that worked the White Earth State Forest.  All of the lakes in the area were mapped by these workers.  The 2 stone pyramids about 600 feet east of here was the entrance to the camp.  There were over 20 buildings and a parade grounds at the camp.  Not much left after 70 years.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March Lake across the highway is home to a group of Trumpeter Swans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks roylake for the history of this cache sight which we have listed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please respect the property when looking for this cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck, Enjoy And Most Of All Have Fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you have.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads Go Out To conniewolf For The FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is our first in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads to Fargnot for the FTF on this one, the cold weather didn't seen to hold you back!

Ground Zero (GZ) coords are located below, just de-code them? Once

Yes, again this is a Winter Friendly cache and our 183rd Hide!

Here's what you have to do to solve this puzzle cache shown below.
De-code the coords listed below with the Amazing Geocaching Mystery
Wheel I have also attached. Just one thing, I'm not suppling you
with the &quot;Code Key&quot; you'll need to figure that out for yourself and
the rest will come on it's own. Once you figure it out you will
have the coordinates needed to get you to GZ where the search
begins for the hidden cache container! Good luck, enjoy and have
FUN!

When approching this cache you might want to park at the listed park cords and walk the short distance to the old trail as in the winter this road down to the lake gets VERY, VERY slippery, as we found this out the hard way today?

This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads to Fargnot for the FTF on this one, cold weather and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache On!</groundspeak:long_description>

Kim and I both hope you'll enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache takes you into Copley Township in Clearwater County, just to the north of the town of Bagley. You'll be looking for a Camoed Peanut Butter Jar at the final stage of this 4 stage multi, other stages have posted cords to the next stage. FYI, our GPS sure liked to jump around on us in this area at times. However, take your time and you'll do just fine. The start of this cache is hidden just to the west of Lomond Drive NW on the grounds of Farm By The Lake. The area we used for this nice and easy multi is a Nature Walk which is also used for Cross-Country Skiing in the winter months. Trails within are marked with &quot;blue&quot; marking on the trees and trail maps are posted at the start of the trail system. We have also added a copy of the trail map below for your use. This is a beautiful area within the rows of pines. However, please take care of this property while you're in search of your smiley face,,, please don't litter! Good Luck, Have Fun and Enjoy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads go out to CORNRELISH for the FTF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;S224R78 - 2nd Stage&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Here you will find the cords to the 3rd stage.&lt;br /&gt;S324R78 - 3th Stage&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Here you will find the cords to the 4th and final stage of this cache.&lt;br /&gt;S424R78 - 4th Stage&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;This is the final stage, GZ!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is number 4 in a series of Solve &amp; Seek puzzle caches we
have put out. Ground Zero (GZ) cords are located below, you just
have to figure them out / de-code them? Once you get to GZ you'll
be looking for a small type container. Yes, it's another one of our
&quot;Winter Friendly&quot; caches and our 187th Hide! Here's what you have
to do to solve this puzzle cache shown below. De-code the cords
listed below with Our Amazing Geocaching Mystery Wheel. However for
this cache you'll need TWO &quot;Code Keys&quot;. To figure out the cords to
this cache you'll need TWO sets of Code Keys, one for the North
Cords and one for the West cords. Once you figure them both out
you'll have the coordinates needed to get you to GZ where the
search begins for the hidden cache container. This will be a nice
.16 mile hike in to GZ on a nice level trail. You can park right
near the trail head, if you can't find the trail head your not at
the right spot to go after this cache. No bushwacking what so ever
is needed to make it to GZ. Good luck, enjoy and have FUN!

This is our 7th in a series of caches hidden along the WeMe Run Snowmobile Trail. This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads. Some of these caches during the spring and fall months could be wet to get to. ALL of these caches are Winter Friendly. Hope you enjoy this series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads go to Fargnot for the FTF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache On!!</groundspeak:long_description>

After finding all ten of these township caches, put all your numbers together and head to the #GC2468R cache. You might want to check-in on this cache page before heading out to it, as you will need a “lock code” to get into this cache once found. Good Luck and Have Fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads,,,,, Fargnot grabs the FTF on this cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

This trail (very well groomed) runs from Bagley east along Hwy. 2, 6 miles then north 10  miles to the small town of WeMe, or maybe I should say where WeMe was? All these hides are hidden between Post 7M and 7A on this trail which covers 10 miles north/south. Most of these hides are placed 1/4 mile or less from areas where this trail crosses roads.

Kim and I sure hope you'll enjoy it! &lt;br /&gt;This cache takes you into Pine Lake Township in Clearwater County. You are looking for a Small Container. This is hidden just off of Highway 92 just west of the town of Gonvick. Summer parking is listed below, however in the winter months you might want to pull off Hwy. 92 just to the east of this cache and park somewhere on the shoulder of that road. Be careful when approching this cache area. Good Luck and most of all, Have Fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll tell you the Cowboy team must be following me around as here's another FTF for them!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;PK24R46 - Summer Parking Here&lt;br /&gt;N 47° 43.922 W 095° 30.798&lt;br /&gt;This should be a nice pull off for summer parking for this cache. Winter parking should be off the road to the east of this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

I was out with two of my daughters up from the Twin Cities, jenfrenzy &amp; kit kat, who isn't signed up @ Geocaching.com yet for an afternoon of caching. kit kat had never done any caching before this and she just loved it, had a ball. After a 12 or so finds of mine they both wanted to hide a cache so off we headed to this area as I always carry my bags of new caches with me. Once to this area I told them to pick one out of the bag and off into the woods the three of us headed. The hide was made by my girls and all of us hope you'll enjoy it! Kim missed out on this hide (her 1st one),,,as she was work'in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache will take you into Clover township one of Clearwater Counties northern townships. The cache is hidden just off a Minimum Maintenance road which is NOT plowed in the winter months. Once you reach GZ you will be looking for a micro sized container, log only, so bring a pencil to sign the log. Good Luck, Enjoy And Most Of All Have Fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cacher/s can enjoy this cache as you have.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads Go Out To &quot;conniewolf&quot; For The FTF!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache takes you into Alaska Township in Beltrami County. You are looking for a large container. This is a great area just south of the Red Lake Indian Reservation. This cache is located just off the Balm Lake PWA Road, which by the way isn't plowed in the winter. However this hide is only in a few hundred feet in so it makes for a nice winter walk. In the summer months you should be able to drive to within 100 feet or so of the cache, however some bushwacking will be needed in the summer months as well.

You'll be looking for a Camoed Peanut Butter Jaw for  the final cache (GZ) and camoed small size containers with cordinates to the next stage listed within each. This is a great area just to the south of the Red Lake Indian Reservation. The area is located in the Balm Lake PWA, which by the way the road into this landing isn't plowed to in the winter months. Getting to this area in the winter months would make for a LONG snowshoe walk in or a snowmobile would make it real nice and real fun!
