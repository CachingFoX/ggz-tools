            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Mahogany Bay area of Roatan Honduras. In this area you will find an assortment of stores, restaurants, a beach, chair lift to an island and ground transportation that will take you anywhere on the island and a couple of geocaches.

You are looking for a cammo &quot;pre-form&quot; (looks like a test tube) cache about 60 feet from a walking trail which leads you to a beach area off of the main shopping district. Shouldn't be too hard to find, but stealth will be a must on high traffic days.

Special thanks to Sam Bodden who has agreed to watch this cache along with my other cache in this area.

This cache is brought to you by the Cruisin' Cachers consisting of RGS, BBD1, IBEW-Ret, Aldy, JanS03, Lakewannabees, Readingteacher27, Model12 and their spouses. Seems like one or more of us visits this area several times a year.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Mahogany Bay-Roatan. This area was recently developed to the tune of $62 million for both island residents and visitors arriving by cruise boats. Here you will find places to spend your money and down a few cold ones.

You are looking for a camo round container about 1 inch in diameter by 3 inches long hidden in a public area. Please use lots of stealth and discreetness when searching for the cache. Bring your own pen.

I encourage you to explore the island and the wonderful caches hidden from one side (West Bay and Half Moon beach area) to the other side (Jonesville Bay). If you are not a resident there are plenty of taxi's in the area that are economical no matter how big your caching group is.

Although this is a gated area, the gate is to discourage local vendors from going in and selling their wares. Anyone can come on in and find the cache.

Special thanks to Sam Bodden who will be monitoring this cache.

tour will give you an insight into some of the past events that are
remembered here.

&lt;p&gt;This is a mystery cache. To find the cache, you will need to
first solve the mystery to obtain the coordinates to the cache.
Your tour will begin at the above coordinates. The cache is a
tupperware container with a blue lid and it is located a short
drive from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coords above are the first stage of this puzzle. The
&quot;Additional Waypoints&quot; section below will provide you with the rest
of the stops.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;In 1819, the Alabama Territorial Legislature incorporated two
small villages, New Philadelphia and East Alabama Town and named it
after the Revolutionary War hero General Richard Montgomery. Since
1820, Montgomery has been the county seat of Montgomery County. In
1822 the first courthouse was completed and stood next to the
artesian well. During this time businesses gathered in this square
in front of the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1853 the city dug out the artesian well and created the &quot;Big
Basin&quot; to provide sufficient water for fighting fires and watering
stock. It was surrounded by a decorative iron fence. Over time this
basin became littered with trash and was an eye sore. In 1885, W.W.
Screws, editor of the Montgomery Advertiser, complained about the
condition of the &quot;Big Basin&quot; and plead with Montgomery to do
something about this &quot;hog wallow in the Square&quot;. The Montgomery
city council dispatched Alderman Carr to purchase a fountain for
the site. Carr purchased this fountain which still stands here
today. It was recently cleaned up and is in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a micro cache so you will need to bring your own pen and
leave only your initials in the tiny log sheet. I enjoy coming down
and listening to the water of this fountain. During the week there
is usually a hot dog vendor nearby and several restaurants where
you can enjoy a nice lunch. It can be quite crowded at times so
watch out for mugglers. Take time to enjoy the surroundings and
read the historical markers that are located all around. Please be
discrete when searching and replace the cache well. The buildings
and water may affect your GPS readings a bit on this one so that
adds a little bit more difficulty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your trip!&lt;/p&gt;

If you make the trek here to find this spot you might just need to lay down and rest a while.  You might not want to lay down here though.  This would be a park and grab assuming you could legally get a vehicle within 1/2 mile of here.  So you will just have to park your boat nearby and make the short hike from one of the nearby caches.  Hint is a spoiler.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the place to start exploring MRP if you are new to the
area. The easy trails and variety of nearby geocaches provide a
nice introduction to the area. When you have explored the southern
end you are probably ready for the amazing &quot;Boulderfields&quot;
earthcache, GC14NNW, and some other harder caches in the central
part of the park. When you are ready for some real adventure head
to the northern section of the park and tackle the caches there,
you will not be disappointed.

Note that the Preserve is off limits at night. The Preserve is
owned by the City of Hoover and is subject to rules and regulations
that apply to all city parks. Dogs are welcome but must be on a
leash. Please take a moment to visit the following link with park
rules and trail maps, as well as lots of good information about
what makes this area special.

during morning or afternoon rush hours you understand the name.
This divided four lane road through a barely developed area is
posted at the absurdly low speed limit of 50 MPH and is rarely
patrolled by any law enforcement so the normal speeds are much
faster. In honor of the location, this letterbox has a racing
theme. It should be easy to find. The cache is less than 75ft from
parking on the side road, do not stop on Lakeshore Parkway. The
container is a 6&quot;x6&quot;x2&quot; lock-n-lock camo painted. The log book and
stamp use about half the space so there is room for smaller TBs,
most any geocoin, and small swag items preferably car or racing
related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Observe the 50 mph speed limit on
Lakeshore Parkway. The cache is moving at 0 mph so there is no
hurry!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Shades Mountain&quot;. I have named this ridge &quot;Chemical Mountain&quot; in
honor of the successful businesses located nearby. It was a
continuous ridge 50 years ago but the road builders cut right
through and created two peaks. The two stages should be a good
challenge to get to, this is not a &quot;park and grab&quot; and you probably
don't want to try it during lunch or at night. Do not attempt this
one in dress clothes and you need to be prepared for a good climb
no matter which direction you come from, but I recommend parking at
the coordinates below and approaching from the bus stop at the
corner of Lakeshore Drive and Tom Martin Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final container will hold large geocoins or
small trackables, but not average sized trackables or trade
items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, please note the difficulty and terrain
ratings, this will NOT be a quick and easy find unless you are very
good and/or lucky!&lt;/p&gt;

I knew immediately that something must be done, this has to be the largest park left in the (safe) metro area without a cache. The interesting thing is that this park is so large it has separate facilities for numerous sports. 

Depending on the time of day or the day of the week this may be a lonely park-and-grab or an impossible muggle convention.  It's a fairly easy hide, muggles should be your only obsticle.</groundspeak:long_description>

find a &quot;park and grab&quot; cache... you might be a cacheaholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finally admitted that I'm a cacheaholic.
I've ignored lots of different symptoms and behaviors over the past
few months but after lots of time to think between caches on cache
runs I've realized that I am a cacheaholic.Since the first step to
recovery is admitting you have a problem, I decided to give you the
warning signs in a way that other cacheaholics will definitely see
them... in a series of caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide that you are a cacheaholic there
are monthly meetings in the area hosted by an outfit called &quot;AGA&quot;,
but I hear they only encourage you to continue your caching ways.
There is also a cacher's 12 Step program put together by WheresDIB

Have a bug that wants to travel? Drop it here. Flying out of BHM? Check this TB Hotel for travelers to take with you!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This double-size Ammo Can will hold big bugs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This TB Hotel is located beside my front porch to reduce muggling risk and because we like to meet geocachers... knock on the door and say Hi!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Accessible at any time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to call me if you have any reservations about caches in residential areas, 205-914-6814 and if you don't trust the coords the house number 1512 is just above the cache!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you have a TB too big to fit in this large cache leave it on the porch and I will take it to the next event I go to, I usually attend several a month.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This cache is part of the One Degree of Separation project started at GeoWoodstock IV in Dallas TX where I was given this cache by Snoogans. It got lost in my barn and just now found, so here it is, five years late!

This project was launched to unite the entire geocaching continuum together at one point using the &quot;Small World Theory&quot; as it pertains to geocaching.

If even half of the nearly 13,000 caches originally released on 5/26/2006 get placed as a geocache, no geocacher in the entire world (with even 1 find) should be able to go much beyond 3 degrees of separation from every other geocacher in the world, but the REAL object of this project is to bring that number down to 1 degree for as many geocachers as possible.

One Degree of Separation is a project that has been taking shape and GROWING for nearly 5 years. It's a variation of the &quot;Small World&quot; concept that was proposed in the early 20th century. Many people are familiar with the &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; game, but few know just how far back the idea goes.

For more information on this project and the Small World Theory go to: Small World Theory link = http://geoonedegree.proboards51.com/index.cgi

To visually see how the project grows over time check the ODS: PRIME! geocaching profile stats at: ODS Prime link = http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=c8b5d7b5-b3ea-4e3c-b72c-01b2ab78a6a9

Many other goals will be posted as the project grows, but here are a few:
#1 To have an active ODS cache hidden on ALL 7 continents.
#2 To have an ODS cache hidden in all 50 states.
#3 To have an ODS cache hidden in a number of foreign countries, by milestone, 10 countries at a time. First milestone 10 then 20 and so on.
#4 To have an ODS cache hidden in every county in Texas.

More goals will be posted on the ODS website....

Thank you for participating in what is sure to be a noteworthy point in geocaching history.

TEMPLATE FOR SEED CACHE LISTINGS:
The following information should be used as the the short description for the seed caches contained in each seed pod:

This cache was hidden as part of the One Degree of Separation Geocaching Project. This is a seed that came from GC2EJT4

Please email ODS: PRIME! when you plant your seed, so he can add your cache to the ever growing network of caches placed in this project. E-Mail ODS Prime link = http://www.geocaching.com/email/?guid=c8b5d7b5-b3ea-4e3c-b72c-01b2ab78a6a9

294th cache ever listed on geocaching.com. As of this moment there
are 903,174 active geocaches listed!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This one is extremely easy, but hopefully far enough off of the
beaten path not to be plundered.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is located in a public park near the foundation remains
of the early-1900s Jefferson County Prison Work Camp.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU RE-HIDE IT
WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The cache went missing for the third time and was replaced on
09/19/2009. The new container is hidden more carefully but the same
coords will get you close.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Since it has been moved and is a different container feel free to
hunt and log it again if you've found it before.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I am taking a chance on the finders honor and loading this cache
with some good stuff... please trade up or even and let's keep this
one of the better caches in Alabama!&lt;br/&gt;

Our mission this trip was TAR's GC126, the Trussville Civitan and Alabama's first cache ... can't believe we haven't gotten we haven't done it yet.  We actually found a couple of nearby park and grabs to make this one a milestone.  Cache itself was in great shape and well protected.

What better way to spend the extra time than to find the oldest cache in Alabama. I parked on the road to the north of the river (I think, kind of hard to tell with no water in it) and walked across the disk golf course. A muggle golfer asked if I was doing that geocaching thing and said that he had thought about starting it. I invited him along and he, his dog Sport and I headed over the river and up the hill. My shoes are not made for climbing and I had to walk up the hill using my hands on the slippery leaves. We found the cache after a short search, OK he found the cache, and I signed the log. As I started back down the hill my shoes started slipping again and I decided just to put my left foot out in front of me, squat down on my right foot and slide down the hill much like a roller skating limbo dancer might do. I enjoyed my quick trip down the hill and it really was the best way to do this. Thanks for keeping this cache alive. Now on to Baltimore.</groundspeak:text>

Got there at 8:30, right at dark, wander about, no flashlight (well, it wasn't dark when I left home!), call owner for a clue...yipee! Open the log - Pawpawcache beat me to it! 

Way to go guys! 

Well placed, nicely stocked traditional in a family-friendly place, coords read 4' at the cache - this may exemplify the perfect geocache! 

My son Jamey took the Playstation CD and left a GGA geocoin.

Thanks Bubba!

Use caution because there is still some traffic on the road. There is safe parking for one car at a time on the side of the road. 

No heavy lifting required - actually, nothing has to be lifted but the container itself.

The old scout hut was constructed in the 1920's by the men of the community as a meeting place for the scouts. It served many other functions, including a residence until it was torn down and burned in the 1960's and never rebuilt. A small shelter and bench are now in the same location.</groundspeak:long_description>

While here take a look at these pieces of Pine Mountain history:

Blount Highland School
The first school on Pine Mountain was established about 1880.  Several log huts were built, and it was from one of these that the school was taught.  A. J. Whitley was the first teacher and J. O. Robinson was the second.  In 1883, the hut was used for both school and church, so a new building was built in 1884, but was destroyed by a tornado the next year. Another building was built but was destroyed by a storm on Feb. 11, 1932.  The County Board with the help of loyal citizens on Pine Mountain soon built a modern building that still stands today. In 1969, Blount Highland School was closed and students were bussed to Locust Fork. The building today is used as a Community Center and belongs to Pine Mountain citizens.

Lee’s Chapel Church
In the 1870’s settlers moved here to harvest timber and build homes, schools and churches.  In 1884, the church was organized with 15 members.  In 1886 W. O. Hullett and wife Nancy donated 5 acres of land for a new church to be built. In 1929 this building was damaged by a tornado.  In 1932 it was damaged by a tornado again and had to be rebuilt. With the passing of time, there was need for a cemetery.  The first funeral was for the tiny Dillashaw baby.  The baby had only a rock for a marker, and today the grave is still unmarked.  The oldest marker in the cemetery is J. Horsley dated 1891.

Blount County. Being here at night is likely to generate a
suspicious person call and there's no need to go into the park.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry Mountain School&lt;/strong&gt; was built
in 1921 on two acres donated by Stephen Jonah King. It was used
continuously as a six-grade school until 1951. The first session,
in the summer of 1921, was operated as a “subscription
school” where the parents paid the
teacher.

Blount County, Alabama”&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Take a Gamble was a cache that was archived at the request of a new land owner. We recovered the container for the cache owner. We decided to hide the original container where the original cache owner could easily hunt it. It contains some of the kid-friendly trade items that were in it when it was archived and a few new little trinkets. Please re-hide it carefully and cover it well.

The first true self-service grocery store (not this particular store, but rather the first one in Memphis, Tennessee). At its peak, the company was operating 2,660 stores and posting sales of $180 million a year. However in the 1920s, the company was taken over and its stores sold to regional grocery store companies. At present over 600 independently owned stores operate in 17 states.

Without self-service, modern branded packaged goods would not exist.

Or, if you prefer, &quot;Welcome to the Pig, y'all!&quot;

The Cache: You are looking for a small, screw-top, plastic storage container smaller than the average adult nutria. (No actual nutria were used the in the hypothetical sizing of this container.) The container has been given a coat of camo- please re-hide as found.

The container has been crammed full of small goodies; please trade up or trade even. First finder may take without trade.

Only take Travel Bugs and Geocoins if you plan to log them and move them along to a new cache!

Hide as well or better than you found it.

Nestled in the beautiful surroundings of this public park, you'll discover a unique trinket of no particular value but has a very understated meaning.  Not too far in, not too high or too low, you'll find what you seek.  Search in the obvious places and next to the places that seem obvious.  In a small plastic container with a red top will be a small notepad, pen and marker.  Hope that everyone gets something out of the being there in that moment.  Have fun and please don't take unless you plan to replace! </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a water-proof container placed near the family owned Marion-Kay Spices Factory which also has a great museum to tour while you're here with a lot of history to see.

Please limit to DAYLIGHT hours only!!!

Founder, Marion “Bill” Summers, started the business in 1922, in St. Louis, Missouri.  Since 1949, Marion-Kay has operated in Brownstown, Indiana.   

While working to profect his 'secret blend of 11 herbs and spices', Colonel Harland Sanders used to spend long hours here frying chicken till he got taste right. In 1965 - Summers agrees to custom blend a special chicken seasoning in bulk packaging for Colonel Sanders, founder of the Original Kentucky Fried Chicken. 

Today, the factory is still run by family members and has photos and displays of over 85 years of spice history. 

So grab a cache and some spice at the same time. And tell the owners 'Hi' and thanks............TMC</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I wanted this to be a little more than just 'follow the coordinates and find the box...' So this geocache is supposed to be a little like a treasure map hunt.  The coordinates will lead you to the obviously biggest tree (trunk width) within the reasonable accuracy of your GPSr.  Once you find the tree, stand by it and face NE (maybe bring a compass if your GPSr doesn't have one). Then step off 35 paces (adult sized paces) and you should be close to a tall tree stump. Now find the quart size round container that is camouflaged with tape.  If you are an early finder there are a couple of nickels and several pennies that were custom smashed by the Indiana Railroad on the railroad tracks to the north of the park.  Please take only one coin.
Depending on the weather and time of year you will encounter overgrowth and some damp to muddy ground.  If it has rained a lot you may even have to cross over a runoff stream.
This particular part of the park affords a typically peaceful walk and pleasant scenery. There is just enough bushwhacking involved to make it interesting.



Want this to be easier...
This cache is in the northeast corner of Karst Farm Park.  You can walk the main path in the wooded area until you find the smaller secondary path on the east side.  The big tree is right next to this secondary path.



Need it to be easier still...
Here are the coordinates to the cache itself:

W86 35.814 </groundspeak:long_description>

A micro pill bottle with black electric tape around it. There is a label on top that reads GeoCaching.com and a side label. Easy to get and hide again when you sit next to it, WHOOPS! said to much lol. Just a log book, nothing else so please bring a pen and leave a kind message.

Found with MutherAndSun while heading to the GIG event in the Indy area. We were both extremely ready to get away for a relaxing day of caching. My Jeep, the Midnight Patriot, is being held hostage at the dealership in need of a new axle shaft seal (and hopefully nothing else). So we loaded all the gear and set out in the Cache Wrangler. It was a great stress reliever and as always we enjoyed the day caching til midnight.</groundspeak:text>

 This cache is in Ft. Harrison State Park. The park has a admittance
fee. Short hike off of a paved trail. You are looking for a
camouflaged, plastic jug. Large enough for trades and Travel Bugs.
This is our first cache. Hope everyone has fun finding it. Happy

 HOWEVER, there are three parts to this cache.
In order to claim a smiley on this cache you must FIRST e-mail me the correct answers to the two questions below and then your off to sign the log.
Question #1: Who is the Red Rocker?
Question #2: According to the Red Rocker what is a three  lock box? (what is it/who uses it/why they use it)
Cache contains a FTF prize and misc. items.
Please don't give any &quot;giveaways&quot; in your log entries

****UPDATE****
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT EXPLAINATIONS GIVEN BY THE RED ROCKER ON WHAT A THREE LOCK BOX IS, SO WE'VE DECIDED TO NOT REQUIRE QUESTION #2 BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE CACHE. BUT YOU MUST STILL SIGN THE LOG BEFORE CLAIMING A SMILEY. IN THE INTERVIEW WE HEARD A THREE LOCK BOX WAS A BOX THAT KINGS/QUEENS USED TO KEEP THEIR JEWELS IN WHILE TRAVELING AND IT REQUIRED THREE KEYS TO OPEN TO PREVENT ONE PERSON FROM STEALING.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is not a P&amp;G. This area floods when the river is high, and there is poison ivy and thick brush in some locations. Please use caution.
This cache is available in all seasons, even heavy snow.

Final note: Please take care when retrieving / replacing this cache so others can enjoy this find.

More Details
Parking is next to the old Erie Railroad Tippecanoe River Bridge, also known as Trip Bridge. The bridge's double-wide Lattice Truss style construction is rare in the US. The abandoned track is the last section of unfinished trail in the Erie North Judson / Monterey Trail project, a greenway designed to connect the two towns. A half-mile section is completed in the town of Monterey, as well as a large section connecting North Judson to State Road 35.

The bridge is sometimes used as a night party location, so there are plenty of opportunities to exercise Cache In Trash Out. Please be respectful of the property. You will not need to climb any object to reach this cache. I do not advise crossing the bridge.

The Indiana Spirit Quest series of geocaches will take you to a number of historic cemeteries built by Hoosier Pioneers.


                                        &quot;Indiana Spirit Quest # 501
                                             &quot;Quaker Cemetery&quot;
                                             La Porte County, IN


The Quaker Cemetery site is both humble and quite simple. No gateway or fancy entrance awaits you at the Quaker Cemetery, only this simple granite marker. This cemetery consists of 10 neatly ordered rows of stones which are mostly field stones with no inscriptions.

                                          --- QUAKER CEMETERY ---

                                           AGREED TO CONVEY TO

                                           FIELD STONE MARKER.

--- THE QUAKER CUSTOM ---

Although the bases of belief remained the same through out this religious sect, there were some differences in interpretation of the church laws in various areas. But since grave stones or even large tombstones were considered an adornment or image of the person, many of the Quakers held firm to their belief and the practice of marking the graves was not acceptable until sometime after 1820.

This little cemetery was used as a burial place during the 1830's, early interments including an otherwise unidentified baby, William Bond. There was a William Bond who was also named donor of the land given to the Society of Friends. The ground was deeded to the Society of Friends, April 14, 1836 to be used for a meeting house and burying grounds. In early in 1830 Aaron Stanton and a son, Benajah with two friends erected a cabin on the farm later occupied by Moses Stanton.

It is said that there are supposedly around 400 burials in this cemetery but field stones mark the graves of 54 known graves in neat rows. One of the marked stones is a War of 1812 Veteran, Joseph Johnson. On Sunday May 26, 1968, a commemorative marker honoring the Quaker site was dedicated.

Quakers of the &quot;Hicksite&quot; branch in the winter of 1830-1831 held their first meeting at the home of Aaron Stanton. The Clear Lake Meeting was &quot;laid down&quot; in 1856, due to deaths and removals. The Orthodox branch of &quot;Friends&quot; in the year 1860 established the meeting. Early Quakers in this region were William and Charlotte Bond, William and Esther Clark, the sons of Aaron Ataton who were (Alfred, Benajan, William and Thomas) along with Aaron's brother Amos. Others in this early group were Charles, Henry and Edward Vail, The Howard Masons, Jonathon Smiths and Archibald and Elizabeth Wasson.

The Indiana Spirit Quest series of geocaches will take you to a number of historic cemeteries built by Hoosier Pioneers.

Indiana Spirit Quest # 408
&quot;Teeter Cemetery&quot;
LaPorte County, IN

Teeter Cemetery is located in Galena township, section 26, twp. 38N R2 W
In 1874, Galena Township, LaPorte Co., Indiana, Teeter Cemetery sat on the 120 acres owned by H. Teeter. Although the old cemetery has been ravaged by time and some amount of vandalism, stones vary in condition from totally impossible to read to pristine and easy to visually make out.

Per the obituary of Caroline Fail Teeter, the cemetery came in to being as a new cemetery at the time of her death (December 9, 1880). Caroline (Fail) Teeter's obit states that when her husband died in April 1878, the cemetery was not ready yet. So he was buried in the house-yard and then was re-interred in the cemetery at the time of her death.

Teeter, Caroline (Fail) - December 9, 1880, La Porte Herald Chronicle Obituary - Caroline Fail was born in Marion Co., West Virginia, June 21, 1818. In 1828 she, with her parents, removed to Union Co., Ind., where they remained two years thence to LaPorte Co. where they settled permanently. She was married to Henry Teeter, Oct. 29, 1836. She died on Wednesday morning, December 1, 1880. Mrs. Teeter was converted in 1840, and, with her husband, joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which she remained a faithful and devoted member till death. During the past six months she has been a great sufferer, but with remarkable patience and fortitude who endured all, relying with firm assurance upon her Savior. When she neared the time of her decease, she, like the great apostle, had a &quot;desire to depart&quot;, and to be with Christ.&quot; She was the mother of seven children, five of whom remain to mourn her loss.

One of her sons, Hon. Geo. Teeter, was state representative from this County. He, with his sister Rosa, who remains at home, attended, with great affection and kindness, upon their mother during her entire illness. Mrs. Teeter was a devoted mother, and her children &quot;rise up and call her blessed.&quot; On Thursday afternoon, Dec 2nd, the funeral took place from the late family residence, in the midst of a large assembly of relatives and neighbors, and her remains were laid to rest in the new family cemetery. On the same day, the remains of her husband, whose death occurred in April, 1878, which were interred in the house-yard, awaiting the preparation of the new cemetery, were removed and they were laid side by side.

Rev. Daniel A. Grime formerly a pastor of the Laporte circuit of the Methodist church, died at New Carlisle of typhoid fever after an illness of two months. He was 68 years old and had been retired from active ministerial duties for a number of years. He was married to Sarah Teeter of Rolling Prairie, by whom he had one son, Dr. Henry Grime who as it will be recalled, was judged insane and taken to the hospital at Longcliff. The Rev. Grime was a member of the Terre Coupee Masonic lodge No. 204.

Blockhouse Letterbox&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A frontier
observation location at North Muskegon's highest vantage
point.&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Welcome to a picturesque view of Muskegon State Park's Blockhouse
along Scenic drive. It is an observation point and a replica of a
frontier blockhouse. The views of a sunset from within this rugged
dwelling can be breathtaking some evenings.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These forms of pioneer forts were typically designed to defend the
community from attacks of Indians. Early American settlers built
long blockhouses to defend themselves against Indians. The logs
were pierced with slits through which defending riflemen could
fire.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This site does have posted hours from 8:00am-10:00pm.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At 1300 acres, Muskegon State Park, on the Lake Michigan shoreline
is a beautifully wooded retreat within the dunes. It offers a
swimming beach with changing facilities, a picnic area, hiking and
boat launching facilities. There are 357 campsites available at
this popular park with modern restrooms and electricity at some
sites. In season, the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex is a cool
spot. It features lighted cross-country ski trails, two outdoor ice
rinks, a sledding hill and one of only three luge runs in our
nation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caching stop also offers a benchmark to be found. Its
coordinates are N43 15.318&lt;br/&gt;
W086 20.973, however it is not listed on GC.com.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A map of this park's trails are also available for download their
website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Clues to the
Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In the spirit of letterboxing we don't give you the coordinates to
the cache but instead a series of clues or directions to find it.
You don't need to have a personal stamp &amp; personal log book to
seek this cache, but to stay with the intent of letterboxing a
personal stamp would be nice. You can get a stamp of your own at
most hobby stores, they aren't very expensive. &lt;b&gt;Please don't take
the stamp or ink pad from the cache; they are to stay in the
cache.&lt;/b&gt; To learn more about Letterboxing, visit
letterboxing.org.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The coordinates on this cache page will lead you to the larger of
the two parking lots down below the blockhouse. After collecting
your caching gear from your vehicle and a bottle of water, hike up
the sidewalk to the blockhouse. Begin circling around the dwelling
counter-clockwise. Portions of the year the man-door on the south
face of the blockhouse is open for visitors to access the interior
of the building and the view it offers to its guests. Continue to
circle around the building . When the split rail fence to your
right come to an end you will be looking at an unmarked foot trail
toward the north. Begin your descent along this trail. You'll zig a
little west around forty paces, then the trails zags a little east
for another thirty paces. (Stay the right more predominant path)
You will have gone about 2/3 of the way down the slalom when you
reach this heartless tree of a Traditional hide.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From this heartless tree traverse north-east twenty more paces down
the slope. Seek the down tree of no bark that reaches from stump to
stump. Where the down tree of no bark passes the tall healthy one,
you will find this Letterbox treasure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once the cache is found should relax on the fallen bark-free tree
trunk. Here you can stamp your personal logbook with the stamp in
the cache (please place back in cache when done) and stamp our
logbook with your stamp. If you do not have a stamp, feel free to
draw something for us to enjoy. If you can't draw, please sign your
name.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please replace stamp and logbook into each of their respective
ziploc bags to prevent the ink on the stamp from ruining the
logbook. Some wipes are provided in case it gets messy. Please
carefully return the cache as you found it for others to enjoy in
the future.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks to the folks at Rubberstamps.net for their quality
stamps.


&lt;br/&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The true challenge is returning to the blockhouse's dune peak after
making this find. The assigned cache terrain rating is a function
of the short yet demanding hike back up to the blockhouse. Once you
return to the summit, reward yourself with a few extra minutes to
relax, catch your breath, admire this structure, and the view from
this location.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please leave this site a little more pristine for the next cacher
by practicing C.I.T.O. as you return to your vehicle.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

at&lt;br/&gt;
Michigan's Geocaching
Winter Olympics...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yields a
Patriotic Cache Container for Michigan's western
coast!&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;History of the Cache
Container:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Not so long ago, in a land not too far away, two families from
western Michigan combined to form two four-person teams in pursuit
of Olympic gold.. The teams converged on Michigan’s
Geocaching Winter Olympics C.I.T.O. Event &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fde9407c-27b2-4b38-91cc-8a0684141aaf&quot;&gt;GC222HN&lt;/a&gt; just south of Jackson, Michigan. West
Coast 1 and West Coast 2 clawed, climbed, fell, lunged, leap,
searched, shot, dashed, and laughed as they strove for excellence.
In doing so, West Coast 1 &amp; 2 brought home three silver medals
and the distinguished honor of two last place finishes. This cache
container was the final award for our last place finish in the race
down the snow-hill. The kids of all ages had loads of fun. Enjoy
this cache container and keep an eye out for future Nurse
Nanna’s events; they are always colorful, creative, and
crazy!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;b&gt;About the Cache
Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is located on some federal land on the north side of Duck
Creek. Please approach the cache from the north. &lt;b&gt;The parking
coordinates are N 43 20.450 W 086 19.446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is at the listed coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This find is not too tough for anyone with some caches under their
belt. The real challenge for us was honoring this cache container
with a respectful paint job and classic hide to best serve our fond
memories from Nurse Nanna's Michigan Geocaching Winter Olympics
Event.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This is our first cache,a fun cache for the kids.  There is a small keychain compass by Brunton for the FTF cache hunter.  The kids put Spiderman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer, dinosaurs, Cheetah Girls, Strawberry Shortcake, Lightning McQueen, tools, and other kids stuff.Thanks to Skipherr for letting us borrow a MIGO container sticker this afternoon.  We placed a Grey Wolf travel bug in the container and dragon trackable coin.This cache is approved by the Park Manager.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This cache
container was too cool to leave resting in the garage,&lt;br/&gt;
so we decided to recycle it from the Newaygo State Park where it
use to hide out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;About the
location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The container is hidden just beyond the back corner of newly
constructed gas station. I have been wanting to cause a little
stress for those caching along the highway on family road trips,
with a little more challenging hide.&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;b&gt;About the
cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small lock-n-lock carefully nestled within a wooden
hideout. Please carefully return the cache as you found it.


&lt;br/&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Is probably not drawing too much attention to yourself off in the
woods just beyond parking area. Pay attention to your GPS and then
enjoy the find.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cache is at the listed coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;




&lt;b&gt;First To
Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;b&gt;About the
Treasure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You are
searching for the treasure chest at the World’s End. In order to
begin this treasure search you must first locate
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=d5431c05-ef7e-49bc-a382-edf54dd1a11d&quot;&gt;Davy Jones Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt; and the
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fce5d5f3-5092-4e5f-912f-4bbb08c5329a&quot;&gt;Black Pearl’s Treasure Chest.&lt;/a&gt; A clue lies
   within each to find this treasure. Legends say this vast
   treasure comprised of riches from the British sailing fleet that
   was charged with ridding the seas of pirates. Only the most
   cunning and crafty of captains could outwit, out-battle, and
   oulast the attack of the mighty British fleet. They hid their
   riches here at the world’s end. The extreme riches were buried
   here by only the most fanatical and fantastic of pirate
   captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t get shanghi’d on this quest...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Are ye brave
enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; 





&lt;b&gt;About the
Clues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This treasure
hunt is said to lead you from the sea, to highest of peaks, and
dark valleys. Its been said that many a treasure hunter has
perished on this grueling hike. Skeletons of dehydrated sea-going
outlaws have littered these sandy dunes. It was the bottles of
spiced rum that fueled these bandits to permit these spoils to be
hidden in this devilish site. Cherish your hunt as its physical
dangers and booby-traps may make it your last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These pirates failed to reach the
summit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
     
&lt;p&gt;You will need
to find five clues prior to reaching the treasure’s hiding
location. Legend says the key to the riches of this pirate cannot
be found without the wisdom of a map, drawn by one Captain Jack
Sparrow himself. However, the clues to reach this may send your
mind a spinning like two ships on a perilous journey to
nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of
mutiny within your crew! Greed, thirst, and hunger for riches has
turned friends to foes and rivals to murderers. Keep your crew near
and your enemies even closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beware of Mutiny within your Crew...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are Ye Pirate Enough to Find All Three
Treasures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; 






&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This series
of three six-stage multi-caches are located in Meinert Park in
northern Muskegon County along the Lake Michigan shoreline. This
park does have posted hours from dawn to 10:00pm. This park does
have a county daily $5 fee or $20 annual permit requirement, so we
have worked hard to make this a memorable cache series at this
scenic location. There is plenty of parking, beach shoreline, play
ground, grills, and picnic tables to meet any family’s needs. For
those attempting all three multi-caches in one visit, start with
Davy Jone's quest first to minimize the walking. Be warned there
are some mosquitoes; bring bug spray so you can enjoy the cache.
Other than the first couple stages of the Davy Jones series all
cache stage are high dry; these first couple stage could get a
little mucky in rainy weather. The posted parking coordinates are
central to the start of the Davy Jone's and Black Pearl’s Treasure
Chests, along with the final of the World’s End Treasure Chest. It
would a nice location for grabbing a weekend lunch before moving on
to the next two multi-caches. For those interested in camping,

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The hints for each stage are included in the description above.  You will need to decode the hints with the standard decryption key to unearth this treasure.  For those up for a tougher challenge, try it without decoding the clues.  I would recommend decoding them before arriving at the park to compensate for gps accuracy, since some areas are lower and more wooded than one would expect this close to Lake Michigan.  This is meant to be fun, different, moderately challenging, and memorable for kids of all ages.  Among all three multi-caches, fifteen clues and three treasures, there are no camo'd lock-n-locks, ammo cans, pill bottles, film bottles, pencil boxes, or gladware containers.  The kids had fun helping create these clues.  I hope you enjoy our most creative group of hides.  I put together a series of multi-caches that I and the kids would love to do; I hope you feel the same way after conquering these three caches.  If you really really get stuck phone two three one ~ seven four zero ~ one one two two.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;b&gt;About the

northern Muskegon County along the Lake Michigan shoreline. This
park does have posted hours from dawn to 10:00pm. This park does
have a county daily $5 fee or $20 annual permit requirement, so we
have worked hard to make this a memorable cache series at this
scenic location. There is plenty of parking, beach shoreline, play
ground, grills, and picnic tables to meet any family’s needs. For
those attempting all three multi-caches in one visit, start with
Davy Jone's quest first to minimize the walking. Be warned there
are some mosquitoes; bring bug spray so you can enjoy the cache.

that it now holds the vast riches of the Flying Dutchman and a
secret to the World’s End Treasure Chest is hidden within! This

&lt;b&gt;About the
Clues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This treasure
hunt is said to lead you from the burial spot of Davy Jones, across
a creek, and out towards the sea. His crew had to bury their
captain and the Flying Dutchman’s treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flying Dutchman just off the nearby
shoreline...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need
to find five clues in order to reach the treasure’s hiding
