In this area you will find an assortment of stores, restaurants, a beach, chair lift to an island and ground transportation that will take you anywhere on the island and a couple of geocaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a cammo &quot;pre-form&quot; (looks like a test tube) cache about 60 feet from a walking trail which leads you to a beach area off of the main shopping district. Shouldn't be too hard to find, but stealth will be a must on high traffic days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special thanks to Sam Bodden who has agreed to watch this cache along with my other cache in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is brought to you by the Cruisin' Cachers consisting of RGS, BBD1, IBEW-Ret, Aldy, JanS03, Lakewannabees, Readingteacher27, Model12 and their spouses. Seems like one or more of us visits this area several times a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Mahogany Bay-Roatan. This area was recently developed to the tune of $62 million for both island residents and visitors arriving by cruise boats. Here you will find places to spend your money and down a few cold ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a camo round container about 1 inch in diameter by 3 inches long hidden in a public area. Please use lots of stealth and discreetness when searching for the cache. Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I encourage you to explore the island and the wonderful caches hidden from one side (West Bay and Half Moon beach area) to the other side (Jonesville Bay). If you are not a resident there are plenty of taxi's in the area that are economical no matter how big your caching group is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is a gated area, the gate is to discourage local vendors from going in and selling their wares. Anyone can come on in and find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special thanks to Sam Bodden who will be monitoring this cache.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Hart Family Massacre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possibility of Indian attacks was a real threat to the early settlers of Coffee County. To counter this danger, they erected small forts where the families could gather when an attack was imminent. However, it was not always practical to run to the forts every time an Indian was spotted, so the settlers would also take other precautions. They would try to go in groups when at all possible and the men carried their muskets loaded and ready should a threat emerge. Brothers Josiah &amp; Bob Hart had established their homesteads close to one another in the present-day Fairview community. Unknown to the two families of Harts, they were being observed by hostile Creek Indians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a late afternoon in May of 1836, the Josiah Hart family was milking their cows when they were jumped by the renegade Creeks. The result was a bloody massacre; all of the family were left for dead. From there, the renegades made their way during the night to the cabin of Bob Hart, where they waited for the family to milk their cows in the early morning as they routinely did. The barking of the family dog alerted the family to the presence of the indians, and they fled to the cabin in the nick of time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Indians attempted to break into the cabin but were being picked off one by one as the settlers inside shot them through holes they had poked through the walls. The Indians were forced to withdraw and the family remained on alert until they were sure the indians had left their area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That afternoon, a neighbor rode to the cabin of Josiah Hart to check on them and discovered seven members of the family lying dead in the cowpen. He reported the massacre to Bob Hart and Bob and his family went over to clean up the carnage. Amongst the slain was little two year old Melinda Hart, who was found to be still breathing though horribly injured. The child survived and was raised by the family of Bob Hart. The remainder of the family were buried in a mass grave in what is now the Weeks Assembly of God Church Cemetery in the Holleys' Store community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a medium size lock-n-lock just inside tree line. Please place the cache back as you found it.  Thanks and happy hunting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The song “Seven Bridges Road” was made famous by The Eagles.  It was written by Steve Young who lived in Montgomery for a while in the 1960’s.  He tells a story of a country dirt road heading southward out of town. He says that somewhere down this road was a popular spot where people went to park, party or just get away from it all.  To get there you crossed seven bridges and passed under moss covered trees.  He describes this road and the drive along it in his song.  Supposedly, the inspiration for this song is this road, along which you can find this cache. Today, you can still find moss covered trees and there are several bridges closely aligned on one stretch of this road.  Imagine the view riding down this road decades ago, with stars in the southern sky and moon and moss in the trees, as you travel down the seven bridges road.  This should be an easy find. Enjoy the ride and the smiley!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Too much traffic for that now.  I also knew a musician by the name of Steve Young when I was a teenager.  I've always wondered if he was the same one who wrote the song.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I've started walking this two mile path and have found it enjoyable. Passed this spot several times thinking it needed a cache. My last trek out I grabbed my GPSr and a container and stopped as I passed. Got to thinking about a name and thought of a cacher who has several hides in this neighborhood. One of his first in the area was designed to give the motivated walkiing cacher a break. Well I decided this one would be dedicated to him. So Murfinator if your out getting some exercise take a break here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Then I dropped it while retrieving. That was a more difficult hunt than the original.  Was worth it when I got the surprise Woo Hoo!!  FTF!! Then I dropped the log.  Sigh.

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I finally
did it.  I've
hidden a skirtlifter.  It is different from most
skirtlifters I have found.    Please make sure to
replace the camouflage after you put the cache back in
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulty
rating is due to the high possibility of muggles.  Please DO NOT give away the hide in your log.  Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

this one. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;There is so much bamboo in this corner of the park that there must be a family of pandas in here somewhere. Some days you can see a shadow and hear a rustle and you know there is something there just out of sight. We haven't actually seen the pandas yet but their sign is there if you know what to look for. Tag any suspicious items you may find but leave them where they are for further investigation.&lt;/h3&gt;

Was up before daylight and headed this way as the sun was rising.  Once at GZ, something drew my attention.  Investigation revealed the cache.  Was quite surprised to also find a blank log since the park was open for over an hour after the publication of this cache (until 9 according to the sign). Woo Hoo!!  FTF!!  Nice hide.  A mallard was disappointed I didn't have anything for him to eat though.</groundspeak:text>

I didn't spend a lot of time trying to get an accurate location -- it just wasn't that important at the time. The location isn't historic or scenic and there's a bit of trash about (CITO if you must?). In fact, I don't know why anyone would want to come here except to boost their cache numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not a difficulty 2 -- it's probably only a 0.5, but that's not an option so I randomly chose 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a magnetic (hint, hint) pill bottle, but I listed it as &quot;other&quot; so &quot;micro-haters&quot; can't filter it out. It's a rather ugly duck tape color that makes it look right at home in this area. It may or may not be waterproof -- I don't know yet. Eventually, the log will get filled or wet, or both, and I probably won't maintain it even though I drive by this cache every day on my way to Pilates, because, you know, it's a really pathetic cache. It should go without saying that there is no pen or pencil in the cache, so you should bring your own (if, in fact, you care to acknowledge that you found this cache).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there's no room for any trade items. Yeah, there's probably a place in this area to put out a nice, regular-sized cache, but that would have required some, uh, effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No FTF prize unless you want to buy yourself something at one of the local businesses while you're here. Go ahead -- you know you deserve it for having been the first to find such a pathetic cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please feel free to post your true feelings about this cache. Spoilers and pictures of the actual hide are encouraged so others won't need to spend any longer than absolutely necessary finding it. Nice, friendly, insincere posts may actually get deleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's even more pathetic is that this cache idea was copied from Earle B.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>I shouldn't even have to tell you that you probably don't need a hint for this pathetic cache, but I understand that most cachers like to sit in the woods or Walmart parking lot spending a lot of time decoding hints that may or may not help in any way. I hope this helps, though. Oh, yeah, it's attached in plain sight to the guardrail (GUARDRAIL). ???</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I can't believe I had to crawl out of the backseat of her jeep for this?  You know how hard it is to climb in out of a two door jeep? Did I mention it has large off road tires so I had to climb out and down? And for what? The view? This pathetic cache can't even claim an interesting view. The adventure? Forget about it. The smiley?

Several small animals are presumed missing and many were last seen approaching the park's footbridge. Experts say that most danger can be avoided by being especially stealthy when in troll territory since trolls are heavy daytime sleepers and feed mainly after dark. Trolls are also slow so patrons are encouraged to run when in this area. A park official warns, “Whatever you do, don’t be spending much time round this here bridge; you will surely get yourself eat up by some dang fool troll.&quot; &lt;/h3&gt;

Then I asked two very experienced cachers to try to locate it and they couldn't come up with the FTF. And of course they didn't post a DNF either... like I said &quot;very experienced&quot; - over 22,000 collective finds.</groundspeak:text>

Made my way across the dew covered ground. No visible tracks so I was fairly certain no one had been here this morning.  Started my search at one place but soon moved over about 25 feet.  Immediately, something caught my eye.  Sure enough, it was the cache.  Fully expected to see someone had visited the cache last night after it published but that was not the case.  Woo Hoo!!  FTF!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In addition to geocaching, reading is another interest of mine. The
cache is located at a location where I frequently go to get my
reading materials. The Montgomery City-County Public Library system
has 10 such locations throughout the county. The MCCPL has over
600,000 volumes with a circulation of over 1/2 million items a
year. They have books on tape, videos, films and CD's. They also
have internet access to several electronic databases and computers
available to the public. Recently they have added web cams which
enable families with deployed members to talk live face to face at
no cost. While you are here take time to go in and get a library
card so you can enjoy the services provided at this location or one
near you. You can also access their card catalog and reserve books
from your home computer. The above coordinates are bogus. The cache
is not located there. To find the actual coordinates of the cache
solve the puzzle below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. What is the street number for the PineLevel Branch?&lt;br /&gt;
2. At its founding the Montgomery Library Association was by
subscription membership. What was the cost of this
membership?&lt;br /&gt;
3. How many locations are there in the MCCPL?&lt;br /&gt;
4. What year was the first bookmobile purchased?&lt;br /&gt;
5. The initial library service was started in the city of
Montgomery in this year.&lt;br /&gt;
6. What year did the City and County merge their two separate
library systems into one?&lt;br /&gt;
7. Andrew Carnegie agreed to build a library building in Montgomery
in this year.&lt;br /&gt;
8. On New Years day of this year bookmobile service started in
Montgomery.&lt;br /&gt;

But after much careful restoration he has been relocated to this safe spot where fewer people will get to enjoy his presence. Enjoy the Shakespeare Garden while you are here; it changes with the seasons and is a great place for photo ops. Post some pics here.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Was just getting out the car when the head of security arrived.  We chatted for about 45 minutes before going about our own business.  Found this one in the second place I looked and after expanding my search area about 20 feet.  Thought about coming by to see what kind of cache and a hiding place could go here after the multi which started in this area was archived but had some real life business with which to deal first.  Thanks for putting another one out here.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had a good idea how this cache is hidden from the write-up so came out alone a few days ago with a tool which should have done the trick. Wrong! Arranged for several of us to come out today with the local cache monkey since it is more than a terrain 2. As we approached, we noticed some people enjoying the shade near GZ. We decided we would convert them to geocachers. Got on site and found out they already know about geocaching. Strummin made it look so easy retrieving the cache as he always does. We signed the log and replaced the cache. Enjoyed meeting and chatting with krazyphil20XX and his fiancée.</groundspeak:text>

As we approached ground zero saw that there was a couple resting in the shade at ground zero We weren't going to be deterred though. We already decided that we would have to recruit them into the game because we were going to sign the log today. As we walked up they asked us if we were geocaching. Turns out they had recently started and had already spotted the cache. I did what needed to be done to retrieve the log and the four of us and the two new cachers we met all signed our names to the log. Nice cache. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h4&gt;You'll have to WORK a little for this one; the posted coordinates are not your final destination. This venture will take you through a portion of Blount Cultural Park and is best done as you try to locate the other geocaches hidden in this area. It will give you a chance to see some finer details of the outdoor ART and have some fun answering questions about what you see.&lt;/h4&gt;
(Don't forget to look at my photos and add some of your own.)

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q a=___: Art can be found anywhere. Overhead, between the two restrooms their is a piece of ironwork. How many candles does this piece of craftsmanship hold?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q b=___: Mr. Winton Malcolm &quot;Red&quot; Blount, Jr. is looking all dapper in his suit and tie. So how many buttons does he have on his jacket; both fastened and not?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q c=___: Three sheep are munching some grass. Look into their faces and number their ears one through six, from your left to right. Which ear is pierced?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q d=___: These six children are happily running through the park hand in hand. Look at their shoes and count how many kids had to tie their laces?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q e=___: Puck, from &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/i&gt;, has been dancing so long he has developed some creases. So how many have formed just above his left heel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q f=___: At the base of this art, find the name of the person who put the cat up the tree. Assign a numeric value to each letter of her name (A=1, B=2...) and then add all these values together. Finally, multiply the resulting total by zero to get your final answer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now substitute your one-digit answers in the coordinates below and this will give you the final destination to search for the cache that contains the log.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;N 32° 21. f a d -- W 086° 12. b e c&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's a dirty bird to do&lt;br /&gt;
when his bath is broken?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking is available in the north end of the parking lot close to Stage 1.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;This 4-stage multi-cache will take you on a short walk (0.2 mi.) in and around a grassy clearing near the MMFA building.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stages 1, 2 and 3 may take a little thought to sort through clues as to where to go next. You will NOT need to demanufacture any of the items. Please replace each item back as you found it. A clipboard and scratch paper may be handy in sorting out clues.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final stage has space available for SWAG and Trackables.&lt;br /&gt;
Take your time and enjoy the find. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Congrats to THeSKuLL for the Early-Bird FTF!!&lt;/h3&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Also, take time to visit the art museum, especially if you need a break from the weather. There are lots of kid friendly sights and the ARTWORKS Gallery contains more than 40 interactive exhibits for exploring art. If you find that it is closed you should still sneak a peak at the outdoor pieces. Enjoy.&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h3&gt;This 1st one can be a park-n-grab but in the spirit of GOYB you should park as far away as possible and take this one in stride. Maybe even do a little stretching as you approach the cache so you look like a pro to the muggles close by. A lunge or two as you get to GZ and then touch your toes to ensure flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;

Tried one way in where our arrows turned to the 3 o'clock position but that did not appear to be the best way. Went back to the trail and headed a little further down. Found a way which was better than the first we attempted. Still had a little bushwhacking and some poison ivy with which to deal. Got to the general GZ area. I headed where my GPSr pointed and soon found the cache. Suspected the CO would have used this type container. Nice touch with the contents, too. Log and baggie were quite wadded up but we straightened them out. Thanks for the fun hide.</groundspeak:text>

Met xptwo here to find the cache and another item. Spotted a good place when we first walked up.  I was using my phone which takes a few seconds to catch up so it was pointing at another possibility about 30 feet away.  Mrs. xptwo found the nicely hidden cache at the first spot. Claimed the coveted STF line. Thanks for the cache and my first of the other.</groundspeak:text>

Your tour will begin at the above coordinates. The cache is a
tupperware container with a blue lid and it is located a short
drive from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coords above are the first stage of this puzzle. The
&quot;Additional Waypoints&quot; section below will provide you with the rest
of the stops.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;In 1819, the Alabama Territorial Legislature incorporated two
small villages, New Philadelphia and East Alabama Town and named it
after the Revolutionary War hero General Richard Montgomery. Since
1820, Montgomery has been the county seat of Montgomery County. In
1822 the first courthouse was completed and stood next to the
artesian well. During this time businesses gathered in this square
in front of the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1853 the city dug out the artesian well and created the &quot;Big
Basin&quot; to provide sufficient water for fighting fires and watering
stock. It was surrounded by a decorative iron fence. Over time this
basin became littered with trash and was an eye sore. In 1885, W.W.
Screws, editor of the Montgomery Advertiser, complained about the
condition of the &quot;Big Basin&quot; and plead with Montgomery to do
something about this &quot;hog wallow in the Square&quot;. The Montgomery
city council dispatched Alderman Carr to purchase a fountain for
the site. Carr purchased this fountain which still stands here
today. It was recently cleaned up and is in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a micro cache so you will need to bring your own pen and
leave only your initials in the tiny log sheet. I enjoy coming down
and listening to the water of this fountain. During the week there
is usually a hot dog vendor nearby and several restaurants where
you can enjoy a nice lunch. It can be quite crowded at times so
watch out for mugglers. Take time to enjoy the surroundings and
read the historical markers that are located all around. Please be
discrete when searching and replace the cache well. The buildings
and water may affect your GPS readings a bit on this one so that
adds a little bit more difficulty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your trip!&lt;/p&gt;

The wind was blowing in a direction today that sprayed our search area so we were damp before we were done.  Found a magnet attatched and was afraid this one was gone but searched a little further and found that it was still there.  The log is full though.  Thanks for bring us here.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;The first multicache I ever found was here.  I had not seen anything like the first stage and really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to place a multicache for some time but had not found a location which I liked.  When the original Sleepy Hollow cache was archived, I decided I would put out my own variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for muggles and enjoy the park.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a neighborhood park so please limit your search to daylight hours when the park is open.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Please place back exactly as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tommy Shaw was born in Montgomery in 1953.  Early on he played with many local bands before moving away from Montgomery after high school.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While playing with MS Funk in Chicago, Tommy was noticed by the manager of the band, Styx.  In the mid 70’s, Tommy Shaw moved back to Montgomery to form the band, Harvest, with childhood friends Jimbo Jones, Tommy Beavers and Eddie Wohlford.  They performed at a club known to the locals as “The Kove” that was in the nearby establishment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About six months after Harvest formed, one of the guitar players for Styx quit suddenly when the band was about to start a national tour.  The manager remembered Tommy Shaw from the show in Chicago.  The story goes that all they knew about Tommy was he was playing at a club in a bowling alley in Montgomery.  Since there were only two bowling alleys in Montgomery at that time, it didn’t take long to find him.  And as the saying goes, the rest is history.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tommy Shaw was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame on February 22, 2008 at their awards banquet held here in Montgomery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to Vince for permission for this cache placement.</groundspeak:long_description>

I decided since I was already late for work I'd just be a little later. Was able to find it fairly quick but I had to look at the hint. I love this place. We've been here several times, but not since they opened up this new area. Have to come back with the family next week and tour Old Alabama Town again.

Thanks for the hunt!

&lt;p&gt;I
placed this short two stage multi to add a little variety of cache
types at Cooter’s Pond
Park.  This multi
shouldn’t take long unless the pavilion is being
used.  Then I would
recommend returning at another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stage is a little magnetic key
holder.  Second stage is
a painted preform. 
Coordinates and hint for second stage
are in the first stage.  Neither stage has a writing
implement so bring your own to sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I
took several waypoints with slightly different results and have
averaged those. Neither stage is particularly
difficult.  However,
coordinates may vary due to effect of the  building and tree cover on
GPSr reception and is reflected in the
difficulty rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you close the
second stage properly so it will stay water tight.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

add a few more caches to this park.  This is in a

remove the transportation themed stamps or ink pad from the

We were surprised to see that this one was still unfound even though it published yesterday. Woohoo a FTF for us. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the view while finding the painted preform cache container. Bring your own writing stick to sign the log as there is not one in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is your chance to increase your knowledge of pickles.   So, grab a dill, sit down, pucker up and get crunching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is at N 32.25.ABC  W 086.23.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A=# of letters in the last name of the person credited with introducing pickles to the New World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B=# of letters in the last name of the person to first commercially pack pickles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C=last number in the total number of pickle varieties George Washington had in his collection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D=the average number of pounds of pickles eaten by Americans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E=# of letters in country where Vespucci was a pickle merchant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F=# of warts per square inch of pickle preferred by Americans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickles date back forty-five hundred years to Mesopotamia where it is believed cucumbers were first preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Pickle Packers International, Inc., the trade and research association founded in 1893, the perfect pickle should exhibit seven warts per square inch for American tastes. However, Europeans prefer wartless pickles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickles are technically a fruit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans consume about nine pounds of pickles per person.   The average dill pickle has only 15 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific Islands, natives pickle their foods in holes in the ground lined with banana leaves, and use them as food reserves in case of storms. The pickles are so valuable that they've become part of the courting process, helping a man prove he'll be able to provide for a woman. In Fiji, guys can't get a girl without first showing her parents his pickle pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kool-Aid pickles have become a delicacy in the Mississippi Delta.  A Kool-Aid pickle is often called a Koolickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbus rationed pickles to his sailors to keep them from getting scurvy. He even grew cucumbers during a pit stop in Haiti to restock for the rest of the voyage. Columbus is credited with introducing pickles to the New World.  AmerigoVespucci, for whom America is named, was a pickle merchant in Seville, Spain before becoming an explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napoleon put up the equivalent of $250,000 as a prize to whoever could figure out the best way to pickle and preserve foods for his troops.  As a result, Nicholas Appert was the first person to commercially pack pickles in jars in 1820.  Napoleon and Julius Caesar rationed pickles to soldiers on their various military campaigns.  The U.S. government earmarked 40% of pickle production during World War II for the troops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cleopatra, a devoted pickle fan, believed they enhanced her beauty. George Washington had a collection of 476 different kinds of pickles. In 850 BC Aristotle praised the healing benefits of the pickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw, lacto-fermented vegetables (pickles) have good bacteria that inhibit the growth of harmful microbes in the intestines.  They have a higher concentration of vitamin C.  They help you absorb iron better.  Research shows that vinegar can help with weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More than half the cucumbers grown in the U.S. are made into pickles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Getting to the cache wasn't going to be too difficult but coming back might be.  Finally decided upon a route.  Soon spotted the cache and carefully made my way there. Enjoyed the beautiful area and grabbing the coveted STF line.  Future hunters beware of carpenter ants near GZ and the PI sprouting everywhere if one is sensitive to it.  </groundspeak:text>

I was impressed by the views and terrain of this area and felt it could use a few more caches.  This is a two stage multi-cache. Both stages are located in rocky terrain and some areas may be slick. Be sure to watch your step and look out for critters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

By the time we got back to the car, we were tired.  However, both of us like to finish what we start.  We found where we wanted to begin our journey to the final.  After resting a few minutes and enjoying some ice cold water, we headed that way.  Took a few minutes to locate the nicely hidden, well camouflaged container as there are many possible hiding places.  Thanks for the challenging multi.  </groundspeak:text>

J took a car (his favorite) and left a car. P took DQ cupon &amp; left plane puzzle.

My GPSr got me close.  Then the cover threw it off. After I read the monuments, I decided to sit down and watch a fellow preflight his plane while I reasoned out possible &quot;sneaky&quot; hiding places.  After that, I found it fairly quickly.

Never knew about the monuments.  Thanks for bringing me here.  TFTC SL</groundspeak:text>

It was named for the Coosa River, which forms its western boundary. The word &quot;Coosa&quot; is believed to mean &quot;cane-brake&quot; in the Alibama-Kossati Indian dialect. Coosa County lies in the east-central part of the state. It is bordered by Shelby, Talladega, Clay, Tallapoosa, Elmore, and Chilton counties. It currently comprises 675 square miles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A site on Albert Crumpler's plantation on Hatchemalega Creek was chosen as the county seat and given the name Lexington. In 1835 the name was changed to Rockford. Other towns and communities include Equality, Nixburg, Unity and Goodwater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The estimated population of Rockford, in 2003, was 410. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Authority:&lt;br/&gt;Owen, Thomas McAdory.

The walk is on a flat paved rail bed, and shouldn't be physically challenging.  The trail is about 2 miles, end to end, connecting the Hillsboro subdivision with Old Cahaba and Helena Middle School.  It can be quite active with people, so please use discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this being a series, it is NOT a power series of mindless 1.0/1.0 hides.  It is a series to make you think, and hopefully have some fun in the process.  This is NOT about the numbers.  I do not like Park and Grab hides, so this is NOT a park and grab series.  It will require some walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please, post no spoilers to keep it fun for other finders.  I tried to use a variety of hides to keep this interesting.  Please feel free to send me a PM if you have a problem with the cache, or, if you think it will give me a warm fuzzy to tell me I did a good job.  (It does).  I'll offer hints by PM only.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I live very close, so maintenance shouldn't be a problem.  If you find it, and the cache needs help, please, don't hesitate to set a maintenance flag on it.  If you can't find it, don't put a maintenance flag on it.  DNF it, PLEASE.  I'll have a pretty good idea if it's gone missing by the find/DNF ratios.

Cache placed with permission of the owner, but please stay near the road and don't roam the yard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago there was a TV show with a talking horse. It was a little before my time but I heard a lot about it.  Today's kids have their very own typing horse! That's right, a horse named José lives in the field across the road and he is quite a character. He posts almost daily on a social media website that is like a book of faces. ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His owner is a nice lady that lives in this house and enjoys people visiting her famous horse. José is usually out in the mornings, sometimes he may be in the barn or hiding in the trees if it is hot though.  The owner kindly asks that you do NOT feed the horse, and be careful because sometimes José likes to nibble hands because he thinks you might have food.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hillsboro Trail South Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a short series of caches that will hopefully challenge your mind more than your body. The walk is on a flat paved rail bed, and shouldn't be physically challenging. The trail is about 2 miles, end to end, connecting the Hillsboro subdivision with Old Cahaba and Helena Middle School. It can be quite active with people, so please use discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this being a series, it is NOT a power series of mindless 1.0/1.0 hides. It is a series to make you think, and hopefully have some fun in the process. This is NOT about the numbers. I do not like Park and Grab hides, so this is NOT a park and grab series. It will require some walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please, post no spoilers to keep it fun for other finders. I tried to use a variety of hides to keep this interesting. Please feel free to send me a PM if you have a problem with the cache, or, if you think it will give me a warm fuzzy to tell me I did a good job. (It does). I'll offer hints by PM only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I live very close, so maintenance shouldn't be a problem. If you find it, and the cache needs help, please, don't hesitate to set a maintenance flag on it. If you can't find it, don't put a maintenance flag on it. DNF it, PLEASE. I'll have a pretty good idea if it's gone missing by the find/DNF ratios. I will check on it, because I take the responsibility for my caches seriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Salk for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

Hint is a spoiler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hillsboro Trail is a beautiful public walking, running, or biking trail that connects the Hillsboro and Old Cahaba neighborhoods and the Helena Middle School.  It is a &quot;rails to trails&quot; type project, converting a 130+ year old side rail that went to the coal mines to the south along Coalmont Road in what is now the Cahaba Wildlife Management Area (CWMA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near here was the location of the Civil War era Hillsboro Coke Ovens, which were near the intersection of this trail and the active rail line just north of here. These ovens cooked the impurities of the raw coal ore out, leaving the purer 'coke' coal which was loaded back onto the rail cars and shipped to the Confederate arms factory near Selma and later to the Oxmoor Iron Furnace and other iron furnaces in Birmingham. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The block outer walls of the ovens were removed in the 1940's and used to make the support piers for the County Road 52 bridge over the Cahaba River about a mile and a half from here, which still stands today. With the outer walls removed, the gravel and rock which surrounded the ovens has collapsed, leaving a long straight pile of rubble that parallels the trail on the other side of the creek. Today there are plans in place to preserve this area and will soon be a historical site.</groundspeak:long_description>

According to the latest U.S. Census, Helena now has almost 17,000 residents which makes it close in size to neighboring Pelham, which has 20,000 residents.  Unfortunately due to geography and Helena's previously small size there are only two roads north out of Helena, and this is one of them.  The other road heads northwest towards Bessemer, so during &quot;rush hours&quot; this single road caries several thousand cars north to Riverchase, and some turn here onto Bearden Road to go over the hill to Pelham and Hwy. 31. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farm across the road is Bearden Farms, owned by the Bearden family which have lived here for several generations and have been active in the Pelham and Helena communities for a long time.  University of Alabama Football fans will remember the tough punter Lane Bearden who grew up here. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pelham High School is at the top of the hill, and it still serves the entire 37,000 residents of Pelham and Helena.  As you can imagine it is quite full, although plans are progressing for a new Helena High School to serve the Helena area at the location of geocache GC28E2M.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the place to start exploring MRP if you are new to the&lt;br/&gt;area. The easy trails and variety of nearby geocaches provide a&lt;br/&gt;nice introduction to the area. When you have explored the southern&lt;br/&gt;end you are probably ready for the amazing &quot;Boulderfields&quot;&lt;br/&gt;earthcache, GC14NNW, and some other harder caches in the central&lt;br/&gt;part of the park. When you are ready for some real adventure head&lt;br/&gt;to the northern section of the park and tackle the caches there,&lt;br/&gt;you will not be disappointed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the Preserve is off limits at night. The Preserve is&lt;br/&gt;owned by the City of Hoover and is subject to rules and regulations&lt;br/&gt;that apply to all city parks. Dogs are welcome but must be on a&lt;br/&gt;leash. Please take a moment to visit the following link with park&lt;br/&gt;rules and trail maps, as well as lots of good information about&lt;br/&gt;what makes this area special.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We searched for a while before expanding our search area and made the find.  The attachment device broke as I was returning the log. I was attempting to attach the very short and knotted device when part of the area where I was standing started to give way.  I found a place near the attachment device in which to secure the container.  Thanks for the hide and another grid completed for the Well Rounded Cacher challenge.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
Have a bug that wants to travel? Drop it here. Flying out of BHM? Check this TB Hotel for travelers to take with you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This double-size Ammo Can will hold big bugs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This TB Hotel is located beside my front porch to reduce muggling risk and because we like to meet geocachers... knock on the door and say Hi!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accessible at any time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feel free to call me if you have any reservations about caches in residential areas, 205-914-6814 and if you don't trust the coords the house number 1512 is just above the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have a TB too big to fit in this large cache leave it on the porch and I will take it to the next event I go to, I usually attend several a month.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TBs are not trade items, you do not have to swap one-for-one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Why not, indeed.

So we punched in the coordinates from my pocket query into the Nuvi and a few turn-by-turn later there I was knocking on the front door and trying to yank open the lid of the double-sized ammo can (oil that sucker).

Met the (world famous) owner of said cache, introduced myself and picked up the only TB that was currently to be found- a UFD bug.  Unloaded several bugs that we either picked up while in Florida visiting the Mouse or had picked up in Huntsville with the intention of dropping off in Florida.  In short, the Pit Stop is stocked.

Thanks for the cache and the chance to meet another cacher!</groundspeak:text>

It got lost in my barn and just now found, so here it is, five years late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was launched to unite the entire geocaching continuum together at one point using the &quot;Small World Theory&quot; as it pertains to geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If even half of the nearly 13,000 caches originally released on 5/26/2006 get placed as a geocache, no geocacher in the entire world (with even 1 find) should be able to go much beyond 3 degrees of separation from every other geocacher in the world, but the REAL object of this project is to bring that number down to 1 degree for as many geocachers as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Degree of Separation is a project that has been taking shape and GROWING for nearly 5 years. It's a variation of the &quot;Small World&quot; concept that was proposed in the early 20th century. Many people are familiar with the &quot;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; game, but few know just how far back the idea goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information on this project and the Small World Theory go to: Small World Theory link = http://geoonedegree.proboards51.com/index.cgi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To visually see how the project grows over time check the ODS: PRIME! geocaching profile stats at: ODS Prime link = http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=c8b5d7b5-b3ea-4e3c-b72c-01b2ab78a6a9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many other goals will be posted as the project grows, but here are a few:&lt;br/&gt;#1 To have an active ODS cache hidden on ALL 7 continents.&lt;br/&gt;#2 To have an ODS cache hidden in all 50 states.&lt;br/&gt;#3 To have an ODS cache hidden in a number of foreign countries, by milestone, 10 countries at a time. First milestone 10 then 20 and so on.&lt;br/&gt;#4 To have an ODS cache hidden in every county in Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More goals will be posted on the ODS website....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for participating in what is sure to be a noteworthy point in geocaching history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEMPLATE FOR SEED CACHE LISTINGS:&lt;br/&gt;The following information should be used as the the short description for the seed caches contained in each seed pod:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was hidden as part of the One Degree of Separation Geocaching Project.

294th cache ever listed on geocaching.com. As of this moment there
are 903,174 active geocaches listed!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This one is extremely easy, but hopefully far enough off of the
beaten path not to be plundered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located in a public park near the foundation remains
of the early-1900s Jefferson County Prison Work Camp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU RE-HIDE IT
WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The cache went missing for the third time and was replaced on
09/19/2009. The new container is hidden more carefully but the same
coords will get you close.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since it has been moved and is a different container feel free to
hunt and log it again if you've found it before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am taking a chance on the finders honor and loading this cache
with some good stuff... please trade up or even and let's keep this
one of the better caches in Alabama!&lt;br /&gt;

Made the stop while driving around on the little random cache run and picture taking adventure with the Queen of the Castle. We found ourselves down this way and I figured it was time to man up and try to find this sucker again (after complete and utter failure some time back). Almost made the same mistake as I did last trip and let myself get too caught up in the &quot;but the thing says it's RIGHT HERE&quot; mindset and missed it again. Luckily, the wife wasn't having any of that and found the cache without the aid of technology. We were out of swag, having emptied the swag bag on a previous cache, so we left nothing and took nothing. Dropped off a rather hefty geocoin &quot;Hublander's International Help for Heroes Geocoin&quot; and re-hid the container slightly better than we found it.

Couple of travelers listed in the inventory were MIA:

    *    MR. LOOKING UP
    * One Way Caching Geocoin - GOLD

Thanks for the cache! (And thanks for keeping this one going.)

As of this log, this cache will be our oldest physical cache find (having been placed four months before &quot;Geocache by Imperitus&quot; GCAD8) and our oldest overall find (having been placed over three months before &quot;St Louis Arch Virtual Cache&quot; GC7ED).</groundspeak:text>

We actually found a couple of nearby park and grabs to make this one a milestone.  Cache itself was in great shape and well protected.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had an hour and a half to get from Odenville to the Birmingham airport to catch a flight out to Maryland. What better way to spend the extra time than to find the oldest cache in Alabama. I parked on the road to the north of the river (I think, kind of hard to tell with no water in it) and walked across the disk golf course. A muggle golfer asked if I was doing that geocaching thing and said that he had thought about starting it. I invited him along and he, his dog Sport and I headed over the river and up the hill. My shoes are not made for climbing and I had to walk up the hill using my hands on the slippery leaves. We found the cache after a short search, OK he found the cache, and I signed the log. As I started back down the hill my shoes started slipping again and I decided just to put my left foot out in front of me, squat down on my right foot and slide down the hill much like a roller skating limbo dancer might do. I enjoyed my quick trip down the hill and it really was the best way to do this. Thanks for keeping this cache alive. Now on to Baltimore.</groundspeak:text>

Got there at 8:30, right at dark, wander about, no flashlight (well, it wasn't dark when I left home!), call owner for a clue...yipee! Open the log - Pawpawcache beat me to it! 

Way to go guys! 

Well placed, nicely stocked traditional in a family-friendly place, coords read 4' at the cache - this may exemplify the perfect geocache! 

My son Jamey took the Playstation CD and left a GGA geocoin.

Thanks Bubba!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This used to be the main road for all traffic up and down Pine Mountain. (Believe it or not the school buses traveled this way). Now it is just known locally as The Crooked Side. Log only. BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use caution because there is still some traffic on the road. There is safe parking for one car at a time on the side of the road. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No heavy lifting required - actually, nothing has to be lifted but the container itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain and tree cover might cause a problem getting a good location, so I posted a hint.</groundspeak:long_description>

Parking is close by, but please don't drive on the track. Occasional muggles and at times the place is downright crowded. No need to move any furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old scout hut was constructed in the 1920's by the men of the community as a meeting place for the scouts. It served many other functions, including a residence until it was torn down and burned in the 1960's and never rebuilt. A small shelter and bench are now in the same location.</groundspeak:long_description>

Several log huts were built, and it was from one of these that the school was taught.  A. J. Whitley was the first teacher and J. O. Robinson was the second.  In 1883, the hut was used for both school and church, so a new building was built in 1884, but was destroyed by a tornado the next year. Another building was built but was destroyed by a storm on Feb. 11, 1932.  The County Board with the help of loyal citizens on Pine Mountain soon built a modern building that still stands today. In 1969, Blount Highland School was closed and students were bussed to Locust Fork. The building today is used as a Community Center and belongs to Pine Mountain citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lee’s Chapel Church&lt;br/&gt;In the 1870’s settlers moved here to harvest timber and build homes, schools and churches.  In 1884, the church was organized with 15 members.  In 1886 W. O. Hullett and wife Nancy donated 5 acres of land for a new church to be built. In 1929 this building was damaged by a tornado.  In 1932 it was damaged by a tornado again and had to be rebuilt. With the passing of time, there was need for a cemetery.  The first funeral was for the tiny Dillashaw baby.  The baby had only a rock for a marker, and today the grave is still unmarked.  The oldest marker in the cemetery is J. Horsley dated 1891.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above information from &quot;The Heritage of Blount County, Alabama&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HINT IS A SPOILER.</groundspeak:long_description>

Blount County. Being here at night is likely to generate a
suspicious person call and there's no need to go into the park.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry Mountain School&lt;/strong&gt; was built
in 1921 on two acres donated by Stephen Jonah King. It was used
continuously as a six-grade school until 1951. The first session,
in the summer of 1921, was operated as a “subscription
school” where the parents paid the
teacher.

Blount County, Alabama”&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Nestled in the beautiful surroundings of this public park, you'll discover a unique trinket of no particular value but has a very understated meaning.  Not too far in, not too high or too low, you'll find what you seek.  Search in the obvious places and next to the places that seem obvious.  In a small plastic container with a red top will be a small notepad, pen and marker.  Hope that everyone gets something out of the being there in that moment.  Have fun and please don't take unless you plan to replace! </groundspeak:long_description>

likely be cursing my name by the time you get to this one. Once you
get there it is a very easy find, it is the getting there that
provides the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;only park at the parking cords and STAY OFF THE BIG RED METAL
THING.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
First in a new series by Team Size Matters. We are tired of small
caches with little penny erasers in them and have decided to do
something about it. This is a large cache and is starting with
things like a folding camp chair in it. It is about the size of a
normal ammo can only about 3 ft deep. Please help us and trade
even. It should be pretty easy once you get there. Do be prepared
for some serious bushwhacking unless you happen to have a canoe.
There might be a little ankle deep wading involved if has been
really rainy. Also please don't go through anybody's yard to get to
this one. That does make it a little harder but will keep my
neighbors happy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PS: keep off the big red thing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1NGBG - recomended parking&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 08.577 W 086° 53.406&lt;br /&gt;best parking around</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cannelton Locks and Dam&lt;/b&gt; was begun in 1965 and dedicated in
1974 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It created a 110-mile
long lake stretching from Louisville, Ky., to Cannelton,
eliminating three other dams along the channel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Today the locks have a
picnic area, restrooms and an information and visitors center for
watching barges, riverboats and pleasure craft lock through the
dam. Fishing by boat below the dam is excellent; however there is
very limited access for shoreline angling. The dam is south of
Cannelton on Indiana 66. There is a beautiful new overlook above
the dam, a must see.</groundspeak:long_description>

summer gets here! Find it and log it. In-Admin has been notified

Another product of the construction of the Cannelton Dam is
Millstone Creek. There are 18 similar embayments in a 25 mile
stretch of the Ohio River above the dam. If you are headed
downstream you will now begin a beautifully scenic drive with many
cache opportunities. Be sure and stop at the visitor center at
Cannelton Dam. If you are lucky, a tow may be locking through. You
are looking for a container of some type. I forgot exactly what I
hid, but your GPSr will point you right to it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Big Poison Creek (public) Boat Ramp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Cannelton Dam was dedicated and the gates were closed in 1974, the high lift lock and dam system created a 115 mile long lake back to the McAlpine Dam at Louisville and three smaller lock and dams were eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also raised the water level of the pool several feet which flooded low-lying areas around what were narrow and shallow creeks.  This created what are called 'embayments'.  Big Poison Creek is an example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ramp is a simple poured gravel affair and was 'donated' by the owner of the rock quarry in Derby, Indiana (thank you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Launching a boat here requires skill due to a sudden and steep drop-off at the creek's edge (normal pool) and the short distance to a bar on the opposite side of the creek.  You must 'float' off and trim up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boating from the bridge upstream in the creek is not difficult, the creek channel is well defined by stump rows and *was* about 16 feet deep.  After one stump 'bump' about 100 yards upstream, I'd normally run about 50 mph to the straightest stretch of the creek and start fishing the stump row. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navigating from the bridge to the river is a bit more difficult due to extremely shallow water from the ebb and flow of flood waters and silting.  Knowledge of the original channel is a must at normal pool, else you fall prey to mud bars.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conversely, I've launched here when the water was so high I had to remove the seats and pedestals (and duck) to get under the bridge.  Look at the high water marks on the bridge structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've fished dozens of bass tournaments at Stephensport (Sinking Creek), Cloverport (Clover/Tar Creek) Hawesville, and Deer Creek (Rocky Point).  And I've been 'in the money' a few times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But on this creek on one 90-degree day in August years ago, my partner made a cast with a buzz-bait and hooked up with a 6-9 largemouth.  It was the only fish caught by this boat that day, and....  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That one fish qualified as, ahem, largest fish ($500), and 1st place in weight ($1,500).  It was a good day to know how to drive a boat (wink).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.5lb crappie didn't raise many eyebrows here.  A friend caught a 3.2 pounder and did the unimaginable.  He ate it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look just down the creek a bit and there's a nice concrete ramp.   It's on private property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a donation box with a slot.  $1.00 was the norm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and my bass boat sits ready to go in the drive, but hasn't been wet (except for rain) since I discovered caching in 2002.  My cache-rate seems to far exceed my catch-rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is an Rx bottle.</groundspeak:long_description>

Currently all fixed up, we left the old log in it's ziploc in the bottom of the container. It is pretty trashed but might dry out OK in the sun, for now it is keeping the other contents off the bottom of the container.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I wanted this to be a little more than just 'follow the coordinates and find the box...' So this geocache is supposed to be a little like a treasure map hunt.  The coordinates will lead you to the obviously biggest tree (trunk width) within the reasonable accuracy of your GPSr.  Once you find the tree, stand by it and face NE (maybe bring a compass if your GPSr doesn't have one). Then step off 35 paces (adult sized paces) and you should be close to a tall tree stump. Now find the quart size round container that is camouflaged with tape.  If you are an early finder there are a couple of nickels and several pennies that were custom smashed by the Indiana Railroad on the railroad tracks to the north of the park.  Please take only one coin.&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the weather and time of year you will encounter overgrowth and some damp to muddy ground.  If it has rained a lot you may even have to cross over a runoff stream.&lt;br/&gt;This particular part of the park affords a typically peaceful walk and pleasant scenery. There is just enough bushwhacking involved to make it interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want this to be easier...&lt;br/&gt;This cache is in the northeast corner of Karst Farm Park.  You can walk the main path in the wooded area until you find the smaller secondary path on the east side.  The big tree is right next to this secondary path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need it to be easier still...&lt;br/&gt;Here are the coordinates to the cache itself:&lt;br/&gt;N39 08.640&lt;br/&gt;W86 35.814 </groundspeak:long_description>

We snagged a penny and left a penny. There's 1 crushed penny (half crushed) left. 
Thanks for setting this out! We plan on setting our own caches out in the woods.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I finally found it, the elusive Urban Rapids cache that has for some unknown reason taunted me and remained unseen by these eyes! I could have asked Stick in the Mud for help, and maybe they would have took pity on me and helped me locate this one, but I stayed with it despite all the DNF's and today was the magical day!

OK, the first two attempts are logged as DNF's but technically they are attempts at hunting the cache with wrong coords! DOH, and to think I used to load all my coords manually! OK, so I corrected the messed up coords but the DNF's continued! Why do some hides just remain tough for me to spot?

Well I came up with this one in about 30 seconds today, now HOW was I missing that? I will say this is a great hide, but how in the world had I looked past this so many times before? I had been here in the dead of winter with no foliage on the trees and nothing blocking my view or my GPS's satelites so I don't know why it took this long! 

It seemed rather fitting that Pirate 4 Hire signed this log directly under Treasure Hunterz, sort of a Pirate theme! I guess karma gave me good graces on this one today! Thanks for keeping this one alive and going! No one but me around today, thankfully! </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache just has my number! GRRR! I had the grand idea that since I had been on a pretty good roll lately, why not try to clear up a few past DNF's. When I got back to GZ, I remembered one thought I previously had to how this was hidden and if I was right, then today would not be a good day to search.  All the same I looked until I felt a little self conscious and then moved along. What gives with the crazy people running in shorts on a day like today? Only a geocacher would go out on a day like today! TFTH I guess I will have to come back yet another time! At least this time I was hunting at the correct coords!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Only spent a few minutes at what I finally have as the correct coordinates! Didn't come up with it, but at least I loaded the GPS correctly now! Would have looked longer but with the warm weather, the path had more people out than I expected and I felt like I was sticking out like a sore thumb. Someone even honked as they drove by, might have been cache owners or other cachers but I decided I would come back another time and look further. Oh yeah, the correct coordinates are about 1200 ft north of where the incorrectly loaded coords took me, guess it was just an ironic or shall I say Moronic coincendence that the misloaded coords were also right near Urban Rapids! LOL Thanks for the hide! I'll get it one of these days.</groundspeak:text>

The bridge's double-wide Lattice Truss style construction is rare in the US. The abandoned track is the last section of unfinished trail in the Erie North Judson / Monterey Trail project, a greenway designed to connect the two towns. A half-mile section is completed in the town of Monterey, as well as a large section connecting North Judson to State Road 35.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bridge is sometimes used as a night party location, so there are plenty of opportunities to exercise Cache In Trash Out. Please be respectful of the property. You will not need to climb any object to reach this cache. I do not advise crossing the bridge.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

But since grave stones or even large tombstones were considered an adornment or image of the person, many of the Quakers held firm to their belief and the practice of marking the graves was not acceptable until sometime after 1820.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This little cemetery was used as a burial place during the 1830's, early interments including an otherwise unidentified baby, William Bond. There was a William Bond who was also named donor of the land given to the Society of Friends. The ground was deeded to the Society of Friends, April 14, 1836 to be used for a meeting house and burying grounds. In early in 1830 Aaron Stanton and a son, Benajah with two friends erected a cabin on the farm later occupied by Moses Stanton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that there are supposedly around 400 burials in this cemetery but field stones mark the graves of 54 known graves in neat rows. One of the marked stones is a War of 1812 Veteran, Joseph Johnson. On Sunday May 26, 1968, a commemorative marker honoring the Quaker site was dedicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quakers of the &quot;Hicksite&quot; branch in the winter of 1830-1831 held their first meeting at the home of Aaron Stanton. The Clear Lake Meeting was &quot;laid down&quot; in 1856, due to deaths and removals. The Orthodox branch of &quot;Friends&quot; in the year 1860 established the meeting. Early Quakers in this region were William and Charlotte Bond, William and Esther Clark, the sons of Aaron Ataton who were (Alfred, Benajan, William and Thomas) along with Aaron's brother Amos. Others in this early group were Charles, Henry and Edward Vail, The Howard Masons, Jonathon Smiths and Archibald and Elizabeth Wasson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~ THIS IS A GENUINE INDIANA SPIRIT QUEST CACHE -- ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! ~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a keybox.

Teeter. Although the old cemetery has been ravaged by time and some amount of vandalism, stones vary in condition from totally impossible to read to pristine and easy to visually make out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per the obituary of Caroline Fail Teeter, the cemetery came in to being as a new cemetery at the time of her death (December 9, 1880). Caroline (Fail) Teeter's obit states that when her husband died in April 1878, the cemetery was not ready yet. So he was buried in the house-yard and then was re-interred in the cemetery at the time of her death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teeter, Caroline (Fail) - December 9, 1880, La Porte Herald Chronicle Obituary - Caroline Fail was born in Marion Co., West Virginia, June 21, 1818. In 1828 she, with her parents, removed to Union Co., Ind., where they remained two years thence to LaPorte Co. where they settled permanently. She was married to Henry Teeter, Oct. 29, 1836. She died on Wednesday morning, December 1, 1880. Mrs. Teeter was converted in 1840, and, with her husband, joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which she remained a faithful and devoted member till death. During the past six months she has been a great sufferer, but with remarkable patience and fortitude who endured all, relying with firm assurance upon her Savior. When she neared the time of her decease, she, like the great apostle, had a &quot;desire to depart&quot;, and to be with Christ.&quot; She was the mother of seven children, five of whom remain to mourn her loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of her sons, Hon. Geo. Teeter, was state representative from this County. He, with his sister Rosa, who remains at home, attended, with great affection and kindness, upon their mother during her entire illness. Mrs. Teeter was a devoted mother, and her children &quot;rise up and call her blessed.&quot; On Thursday afternoon, Dec 2nd, the funeral took place from the late family residence, in the midst of a large assembly of relatives and neighbors, and her remains were laid to rest in the new family cemetery. On the same day, the remains of her husband, whose death occurred in April, 1878, which were interred in the house-yard, awaiting the preparation of the new cemetery, were removed and they were laid side by side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rev. Daniel A. Grime formerly a pastor of the Laporte circuit of the Methodist church, died at New Carlisle of typhoid fever after an illness of two months. He was 68 years old and had been retired from active ministerial duties for a number of years. He was married to Sarah Teeter of Rolling Prairie, by whom he had one son, Dr. Henry Grime who as it will be recalled, was judged insane and taken to the hospital at Longcliff. The Rev. Grime was a member of the Terre Coupee Masonic lodge No. 204.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~ THIS IS A GENUINE INDIANA SPIRIT QUEST CACHE ~&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a Bison tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIND LOGS ON THIS CACHE THAT INDICATE NIGHT CACHING WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT NOTICE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find fallen or worn US flags at the graves of veterans, please take a moment to upright or replace them.

Wheel Chair Friendly.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The HALL &amp; SHERIDAN Cache is Team Eggeman's Third hide.
It’s a Regular size cache. The cache is placed on Sheridan
Drive Baptist Church property with permission from the Pastor. On
school days teen muggles are every where. At night Adult Muggles
are parting down at Cancun Connection.So you have to be sneaky Most
of the year its a quick park and grab. There is some poison ivy
around so watch your step. But in the winter the terrain difficulty
goes up to a 3 due to the snow banks and the snow depth you will
have to slog through to get to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

So we replaced our old cache in our front yard with this one. We like to meet and chat with the cachers that will be doing this cache. So don't be afraid to say hi. Besides we might just be watching you any way.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is a kid friendly cache. But you will need Two or more cachers to solve stage 1. All tools are provided nearby for you to use to complete the task. The final is a ammo can with swag for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;

at&lt;br /&gt;
Michigan's Geocaching
Winter Olympics...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yields a
Patriotic Cache Container for Michigan's western
coast!&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;History of the Cache
Container:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not so long ago, in a land not too far away, two families from
western Michigan combined to form two four-person teams in pursuit
of Olympic gold.. The teams converged on Michigan’s
Geocaching Winter Olympics C.I.T.O. Event &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fde9407c-27b2-4b38-91cc-8a0684141aaf&quot;&gt;GC222HN&lt;/a&gt; just south of Jackson, Michigan. West
Coast 1 and West Coast 2 clawed, climbed, fell, lunged, leap,
searched, shot, dashed, and laughed as they strove for excellence.
In doing so, West Coast 1 &amp; 2 brought home three silver medals
and the distinguished honor of two last place finishes. This cache
container was the final award for our last place finish in the race
down the snow-hill. The kids of all ages had loads of fun. Enjoy
this cache container and keep an eye out for future Nurse
Nanna’s events; they are always colorful, creative, and
crazy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;b&gt;About the Cache
Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located on some federal land on the north side of Duck
Creek. Please approach the cache from the north. &lt;b&gt;The parking
coordinates are N 43 20.450 W 086 19.446&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is at the listed coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This find is not too tough for anyone with some caches under their
belt. The real challenge for us was honoring this cache container
with a respectful paint job and classic hide to best serve our fond
memories from Nurse Nanna's Michigan Geocaching Winter Olympics
Event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;First To
Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FTF congratulations to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=36a1723f-76b0-481b-bcb8-91d6497d9242&quot;&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This cache
container was too cool to leave resting in the garage,&lt;br /&gt;
so we decided to recycle it from the Newaygo State Park where it
use to hide out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;About the
location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The container is hidden just beyond the back corner of newly
constructed gas station. I have been wanting to cause a little
stress for those caching along the highway on family road trips,
with a little more challenging hide.&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;b&gt;About the
cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a small lock-n-lock carefully nestled within a wooden
hideout. Please carefully return the cache as you found it.


&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is probably not drawing too much attention to yourself off in the
woods just beyond parking area. Pay attention to your GPS and then
enjoy the find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cache is at the listed coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The White River is a great paddle; this cache should be your last
stop before you reach the river's mouth!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;b&gt;About the Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a small lock-n-lock safely protected and camouflaged
from the elements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is at the listed coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The challenge will be finding the right spot to sneak over to the
cache site. Enjoy your journey!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

at the World's End&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;




 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;b&gt;About the
Treasure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You are
searching for the treasure chest at the World’s End. In order to
begin this treasure search you must first locate
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=d5431c05-ef7e-49bc-a382-edf54dd1a11d&quot;&gt;Davy Jones Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt; and the
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fce5d5f3-5092-4e5f-912f-4bbb08c5329a&quot;&gt;Black Pearl’s Treasure Chest.&lt;/a&gt; A clue lies
   within each to find this treasure. Legends say this vast
   treasure comprised of riches from the British sailing fleet that
   was charged with ridding the seas of pirates. Only the most
   cunning and crafty of captains could outwit, out-battle, and
   oulast the attack of the mighty British fleet. They hid their
   riches here at the world’s end. The extreme riches were buried
   here by only the most fanatical and fantastic of pirate
   captains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t get shanghi’d on this quest...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Are ye brave
enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 





&lt;b&gt;About the
Clues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This treasure
hunt is said to lead you from the sea, to highest of peaks, and
dark valleys. Its been said that many a treasure hunter has
perished on this grueling hike. Skeletons of dehydrated sea-going
outlaws have littered these sandy dunes. It was the bottles of
spiced rum that fueled these bandits to permit these spoils to be
hidden in this devilish site. Cherish your hunt as its physical
dangers and booby-traps may make it your last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These pirates failed to reach the
summit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
     
&lt;p&gt;You will need
to find five clues prior to reaching the treasure’s hiding
location. Legend says the key to the riches of this pirate cannot
be found without the wisdom of a map, drawn by one Captain Jack
Sparrow himself. However, the clues to reach this may send your
mind a spinning like two ships on a perilous journey to
nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of
mutiny within your crew! Greed, thirst, and hunger for riches has
turned friends to foes and rivals to murderers. Keep your crew near
and your enemies even closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beware of Mutiny within your Crew...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 






&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This series
of three six-stage multi-caches are located in Meinert Park in
northern Muskegon County along the Lake Michigan shoreline. This
park does have posted hours from dawn to 10:00pm. This park does
have a county daily $5 fee or $20 annual permit requirement, so we
have worked hard to make this a memorable cache series at this
scenic location. There is plenty of parking, beach shoreline, play
ground, grills, and picnic tables to meet any family’s needs. For
those attempting all three multi-caches in one visit, start with
Davy Jone's quest first to minimize the walking. Be warned there
are some mosquitoes; bring bug spray so you can enjoy the cache.
Other than the first couple stages of the Davy Jones series all
cache stage are high dry; these first couple stage could get a
little mucky in rainy weather. The posted parking coordinates are
central to the start of the Davy Jone's and Black Pearl’s Treasure
Chests, along with the final of the World’s End Treasure Chest. It
would a nice location for grabbing a weekend lunch before moving on
to the next two multi-caches. For those interested in camping,
follow this link to

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The hints for each stage are included in the description above.  You will need to decode the hints with the standard decryption key to unearth this treasure.  For those up for a tougher challenge, try it without decoding the clues.  I would recommend decoding them before arriving at the park to compensate for gps accuracy, since some areas are lower and more wooded than one would expect this close to Lake Michigan.  This is meant to be fun, different, moderately challenging, and memorable for kids of all ages.  Among all three multi-caches, fifteen clues and three treasures, there are no camo'd lock-n-locks, ammo cans, pill bottles, film bottles, pencil boxes, or gladware containers.  The kids had fun helping create these clues.  I hope you enjoy our most creative group of hides.  I put together a series of multi-caches that I and the kids would love to do; I hope you feel the same way after conquering these three caches.  If you really really get stuck phone two three one ~ seven four zero ~ one one two two.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

for Davy Jone's&lt;br /&gt;
Treasure Chest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;b&gt;About the
Treasure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You are
searching for the lost treasure chest of Davy Jones. It once held
the beating heart of this infamous pirate captain. Legend has it
that it now holds the vast riches of the Flying Dutchman and a
secret to the World’s End Treasure Chest is hidden within! This
treasure must be found, along with the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fce5d5f3-5092-4e5f-912f-4bbb08c5329a&quot;&gt;Black Pearl’s Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt; before earning
   the privilege to pursue the
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=662b856a-8502-4b53-9567-304b8b1c1119&quot;&gt;World's End Treasure Chest.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ghost of Davy Jones is watching from his shallow
grave...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Are ye brave
enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 





&lt;b&gt;About the
Clues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This treasure
hunt is said to lead you from the burial spot of Davy Jones, across
a creek, and out towards the sea. His crew had to bury their
captain and the Flying Dutchman’s treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flying Dutchman just off the nearby
shoreline...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
     
&lt;p&gt;You will need
to find five clues in order to reach the treasure’s hiding
location. Legend says the key to these riches cannot be found
without the lost key of Davy Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Key of
Davy Jones Chest ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proceed with Caution ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize
for this cache's route being as steep as it is, but I needed to use
this route to comply with geocaching guidelines relating to the
proximity of one cache to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 






&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This series
of three six-stage multi-caches are located in Meinert Park in
northern Muskegon County along the Lake Michigan shoreline. This
park does have posted hours from dawn to 10:00pm. This park does
have a county daily $5 fee or $20 annual permit requirement, so we
have worked hard to make this a memorable cache series at this
scenic location. There is plenty of parking, beach shoreline, play
ground, grills, and picnic tables to meet any family’s needs. For
those attempting all three multi-caches in one visit, start with
Davy Jone's quest first to minimize the walking. Be warned there
are some mosquitoes; bring bug spray so you can enjoy the cache.
Other than the first couple stages of the Davy Jones series all
cache stage are high dry; these first couple stage could get a
little mucky in rainy weather. The posted parking coordinates are
central to the start of the Davy Jone's and Black Pearl’s Treasure
Chests, along with the final of the World’s End Treasure Chest. It
would a nice location for grabbing a weekend lunch before moving on
to the next two multi-caches. For those interested in camping,
follow this link to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://co.muskegon.mi.us/parks/meinert.htm&quot;&gt;Meinert Park.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking coordinates: N 43° 27.541 W 086°
27.292&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The hints for each stage are included in the description above.  You will need to decode the hints with the standard decryption key to unearth this treasure.  For those up for a tougher challenge, try it without decoding the clues.  I would recommend decoding them before arriving at the park to compensate for gps accuracy, since some areas are lower and more wooded than one would expect this close to Lake Michigan.  This is meant to be fun, different, moderately challenging, and memorable for kids of all ages.  Among all three multi-caches, fifteen clues and three treasures, there are no camo'd lock-n-locks, ammo cans, pill bottles, film bottles, pencil boxes, or gladware containers.  The kids had fun helping create these clues.  I hope you enjoy our most creative group of hides.  I put together a series of multi-caches that I and the kids would love to do; I hope you feel the same way after conquering these three caches.  If you really really get stuck phone two three one ~ seven four zero ~ one one two two.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I found this awhile back. I'm logging it now. I thought I would give the Opencaching a try to see if I can piggyback both sites.  I will be logging my duplicate finds from the other site. Thank you for placing this cache for my enjoyment.</groundspeak:text>

After many years, it was muggled and not replaced.  So. I am placing this one back in the same general area as the original.  This is way too neat and beautiful of a place to not have a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking for the cache is off from the road to the east.  It is just over a 1/4 mile hike to the cache location.  The trail is in pretty good shape, but not stroller friendly due to a few trees down, and a steep hill.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We stocked this cache with some kids things, and fishing related things.  If you leave fishing things, make sure the hooks are made kid friendly by covering them or something.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to bring bugspray.  This should be winter friendly.  The cover for the cache lifts right off, no need to look under anything or disturb any nature.</groundspeak:long_description>
