Este es un caché pequeño (espero que el de la basura no lo encuentre y lo deje ahí unos días) pensado para niños chiquitos, así que no esperen mucho. Está escondido en un contenedor de rollos de 35&quot; y tiene unas moneditas brillantes cuyo valor no llegua a los cinco pesos.

-- Who won American Cup in 2011? (soccer)

This is a very small cache (I hope the trashman leaves it there for some days), suitable to be found for small kids, don't expect that much :-) It's hidden on a 35mm film can and contains few (new) non-valuable coins, not worth more than 0.50 USD or so.

This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas.  The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


The area around Cedar Bluff State Park offers excellent wildlife watching opportunities. Food plots and a waterfowl refuge enhance this opportunity.  Deer, turkey, pheasant, Canada geese, pelicans, eagles in the winter and more can be seen in and near the park.  One of the best-kept secrets in the state lies near the park. Threshing Machine Canyon, the site of an 1867 Native American attack on a wagon train bearing a threshing machine, is accessed by a road west of the park.  In the historic canyon you will find carvings dating back to the mid-1800s.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache.  This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage.  Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here.  Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name!  Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge.   At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more.  Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011.

Located in the central flyway, Webster Reservoir is a stopping place for many species of waterfowl and shorebirds and offers excellent opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts for hunting, viewing and photography.  Adjacent to the Solomon River Valley, Webster State Park offers a prairie setting of rolling hills and spacious skies.  Visitors often see mule and white-tail deer, turkeys, bobwhite quail, pheasants and many wildflowers hidden among the mosaic of prairie grasses.  The 3,700 acres of open water offer great fishing in Webster Reservoir.

The Goldbugs were the local mascot until school consolidation changed the name of the school and the mascot to the Thunder Ridge Longhorns. 
The Goldbugs enjoyed a strong tradition in athletics and academics, and the town support for the high school is unmatched.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Prairie Dog State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


A prime place to experience the shortgrass prairies of western Kansas, Prairie Dog State Park occupies 1,150 acres on the shores of Keith Sebelius Reservoir in Norton County.  The park is home to a thriving prairie dog colony and is the site of the last remaining adobe house in Kansas.  The renovated adobe house was built on the site in the early 1890's.  Historical interpretation is a hallmark of this park.  Two vintage 19th century buildings are preserved here, including a one room school and renovated adobe house.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is in a great place for a quick jump-out-and-stretch stop. The location is right off Hwy 183 on the site of a small country church. Terrain is level ground; the cache is wheelchair accessible.

The container is small, but has enough space for smaller trade items &amp; travel bugs.  Initial contents were a toy mouse, a bandage, two marbles and one twist-it-yourself balloon animal (you supply the air).

The family living across the road is aware of the cache, so stealth isn't an issue. Church services are held on Sunday morning and Sunday and Wednesday evenings. While visitors are warmly welcomed at services, cachers would be very obvious if stopping when the parking lot is full. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When one drives down most roads in South Dakota, one will usually find at least one Think/ Why Die sign.  I have found that I love learning the history behind places and things I have seen while Geocaching.  Along with cache in and trash out, I want this cache to serve as a reminder. A little history of this sign. There should be two within 50 feet of each other. The first one was placed in 2002 was for my father. After an evening of celebrating the end of his teaching year at the Crow Creek School, the lunch ladies offered to buy some drinks to celebrate. Later that evening on the way back to Chamberlain, he left the roadway and crashed. His sign was knocked over and has not yet been replaced.The second sign where this cache is located was placed for similar circumstances within two years of his crash. The area is beautiful and peaceful; and reminds us to remember to “Think” as we complete our finds and drive all over this beautiful country.  

Although it is cache in and trash out please be respectful of any possible items that would be better left at peace. 

There are some spots that you can pull off before reaching the location from either direction to avoid oncoming traffic.
