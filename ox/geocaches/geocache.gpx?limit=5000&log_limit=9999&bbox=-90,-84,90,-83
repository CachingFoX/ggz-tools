Sometimes the answer is to pull not twist, other times it is better to twist, not pull.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a perfect place to pick up some of your favorite herbs if the time is right.

What better way to thank him than to modify the container so that we could hide it the correct way.  Parking is not a problem, no fence climbing is needed, but sun glasses might be needed.  The container is large enough for small trade items and is started off with two travel bugs that we need to be moved on down the road.  Bring your pencil and add another smiley to your list. Please replace the container like you found it so that others may enjoy the adventure.</groundspeak:long_description>

You will need to Bike or Walk the last .6 of a mile of the trail to reach this cache.  The road that once lead to this cache is now private.  The cache is still accessible from the trail.  A service road still follows the trail but a 4 wheel drive vehicle would be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring water and bug spray as this is along the river.  A picnic area and scenic boardwalk is located at the cache. There are no trash cans so be prepared to carry out everything you carry in.  You will get a good view of the old Train Tressel or what's left of it from the board walk but you can also walk a trail to the waters edge where you can get a close up look at the massive timbers once used to support the heavy weights of the trains.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is not near the highway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking available at the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The marker reads: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1702 a decisive battle took place along the nearby Flint River. Nine hundred Apalachees, in league with the Spanish, fought here against English traders and five hundred of their Creek allies. Forewarned of an impending attack, the Creeks arranged empty sleeping blankets by their campfires and hid in the surrounding woods. The Spanish Apalachees attacked at dawn, firing into the blankets, but before they could reload their muskets, were themselves attacked by the Creeks. The Battle of the Blankets diminished Spanish influence in North America and served as a prelude to Queen Anne’s War.</groundspeak:long_description>

It flows here into the YELLOW RIVER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the intersection and end of the creek. We as kids used to be able to ride our motorcycles and four wheelers from GA HWY 20 in Conyers all the way down Big Haynes to this point. I come out hear early in the morning. Ten deer or more as I placed the cache. This will be difficult as the summer comes on so please tell me your thoughts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wow, that was fast! Talk2az is FTF this one! Glad you enjoyed the scenery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boo Crew donated a Ammo Can to replace the other cache. Same Location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is amazing the amount of balls out at the GZ from the 2009 flood. We have even asked around about a ball factory getting flooded since there are millions of all kinds out here. The problem being that the Yellow river flooded 30 to 40 feet it's entire length causing the 100 year flood we had here in 2009. Most all the other debri has slowly left the area but you will find balls of every type and size! Enjoy</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Big Haynes Creek Series #1. Come see the Covered Bridge and have a picnic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for a small tupperware not far off the path of the nature trail at the Covered Bridge in North Rockdale over the Black Shoals Lake. This is where I spent most of my childhood. The bridge is most impressive. Built in 1997, the covered wooden bridge replaces a historic ford, which crossed Haralson Mill Road, formerly an unimproved dirt road in north Rockdale County. The bridge is immediately north of the Haralson Mill Historic District, which is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The setting is comprised of the Haralson Mill House, a general store, the old mill site, and a blacksmith shop. The Georgia International Horse Park, equestrian venue for the 1996 Olympic games, is located approximately six miles to the southeast of the bridge. Haralson Mill Road serves as a school bus route and is the primary north-south road in the northern one-third part of Rockdale County.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haralson Mill Road also provides the only access to several large tracts of land, which border Randy Poynter Lake, the county's drinking water reservoir. Encompassed within the Black Shoals Park recreational area, the land to the north of the bridge is owned by the State of Georgia and is leased by Rockdale County. This land is intended for passive recreational uses by residents, to include fishing, picnicking, hiking and more. It is also home to the future Georgia Veteran's Memorial Park, which has been under construction since 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two tributaries supply Randy Poynter Lake. One of the tributaries, Mill Rock Creek, was a ford crossing approximately 20 feet wide which transversed Haralson Mill Road. Previously, the stream crossing was only a few inches deep at times and easily passable. However, with the construction of Jack Turner Dam and the impoundment of the reservoir underway, this crossing would be under water. Since the ford crossing could be under ten to 15 feet of water during certain times of the year, a bridge was preferred over a culvert due to the desire to minimize earth fills and retain mature hardwood growth in the area. Without this bridge, an area of land would be inaccessible with the road terminating on either side of the lake. This condition was not considered acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the overall project improvements, Haralson Mill Road was paved and upgraded to a 35 mph design speed with a 20 mph approach to the covered wooden bridge. Although the primary traffic on the bridge is single-axle passenger vehicles, it has been constructed to accommodate multi-axle vehicles. Additionally, the bridge design incorporated walkways on both sides of the roadway to facilitate pedestrian traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bridge meets the transportation needs of the county while acting as a focal point for the historic district and utilizing the recreational areas preserved as mitigation for the reservoir's impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In selecting the type of bridge, Rockdale County considered the importance of historic preservation of the area, as well as the cost factor. The wooden bridge was chosen, as opposed to the conventional concrete and steel structures commonly seen throughout the state, due to its historical significance. In order to retain the required attributes of the area, bridge designs from the early 1800's were considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESIGN:&lt;br/&gt;The structure emulates a covered bridge design similar to the 1820's era Town Lattice Truss design patented by Connecticut architect Ithiel Town. The bridge consists of three 50-foot spans with solid concrete piers and spill-through abutments, which have been encased with a granite veneer. The bridge superstructure is designed to utilize Georgia wood products and labor while still promoting new timber bridge technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each panel is assembled with high strength bolts torqued to 700 foot-pounds. The advantage to this installation and construction procedure is a high strength stressed deck in a transverse spanned panel. This eliminates the problems associated with hydraulic jacked panels, on-site nail laminated panels, or prefabricated glue laminated panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The superstructure is covered by a conventional roof/truss system. The exterior framing and latticework are treated with Pentachlorophenol. The roof is tongue and groove decking with dressed cedar shingles.Please enjoy this series around this lake and creek. Several other hides close to this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to Talk2az.</groundspeak:long_description>

It has since gone away but to pay homage to the cache that got us started I have placed a multi-stage with all stages in the park.  It also an attempt at something other than a simple micro in a typical container.  It is a small container with a few swag items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have attempted to avoid hazards such as prickers and poison plants, however, come summer, keep your eyes open.  As the weather gets warmer the number of muggles dramatically increases, please re-hide all containers well.  Weekends during the summer can be VERY busy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park hours are currently 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[b]Free Parking[/b]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OC FTF Honors are free for the taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other site FTF honors to gymcat01&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

So we did. The cache is a cammoed lock and lock which is good for a few trade items. Please be sure to hide back carefully since there is a fair bit of traffic in this park-- We saw a beach picnic, a runner, and a hiker while we were there. This one is interesting. There are several ways to get to it ranging from a walk on the beach to a trail hike with breaking waves in the background. I'm not sure how long this one will last-- maybe a season or two before I have to relocate it. But in the meantime-- enjoy. In addition, I have enabled it only for premium members-- at least for the next year</groundspeak:long_description>

The Brock Clan decided to place this cache in the same park as our first find: &quot;By Land or By Sea&quot; which had sentimental value to us since it was the first one we found, but has since been archived. It's a nice hike along a hardpack trail. Great place to take your dogs also. The first one was muggled, so please hide back carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This could be a little tricky to find (as most nanos are) but please be very respectful of the landscaping and surrounding areas. There is ample parking in back of the building in two parking areas. The terrain to the cache is paved and concrete sidewalk and fairly level. I have permission from the property owner to place this cache.

The actual first was muggled--twice, along with both TB's they contained I am sorry to say. This cache is now pretty well hidden, so please be very careful when replacing it.We picked a small park that we like to launch our boat from on occasion. This is a camouflaged container. I have added a new log book and lots of new SWAG. Can it be gotten without a boat. Well, that's a tough question. If the lake is low, maybe a walk or a wade will do. If the lake is high, plan on a swim.</groundspeak:long_description>

This fellow was born on Halloween and lived to be seventeen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once located, the tombstone will lead you to the final cache if you take the year he was born and subtract 1,414. The result will give you a three digit number to complete the latitude coordinates of N34 21._ _ _;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next take the year he died and subtract 1,317. The result will give you a three digit number to complete the longitude coordinates of W083 51._ _ _.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final cache is not far away (you could hike to it, but I recommend taking your vehicle.) Please be respectful when parking by the cemetery. It is best to park along the fence line close to the road. Please re-hide the cache well as it will be easy to muggle if you don't. I have placed lots of cool stuff in the cache as usual including some coin (real coin, not geocoin) for the first to find. This is the first cache placed by me and my youngest daughter-- hope you enjoy finding it as much as we enjoyed placing it.</groundspeak:long_description>

These back roads have VERY light traffic and you can park within feet of the cache. You may get some questions from the locals as to whether you are broken down or need any help as they pass by on their daily walks or jogs, but they are friendly and sincere. Nothing too challenging here. . . maybe I will upgrade it later. Not sure if it's actually handicap accessible since I didn't measure the distance between objects-- maybe, maybe not. . .</groundspeak:long_description>

All sightings have been dismissed as nonsense, of course. While exploring in this area Virgilbrigman and The Brock Clan happened upon a very startled five to six foot long black feline which immediately leaped 12 feet into the brush and disappeared. Probably just a very large domestic cat. There are no Panthers in North Georgia. . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a regular tupperware style container just a few yards from our &quot;sighting&quot;. Most of the trail is well-marked, but may get a little sketchy at points. The trailhead is at these coordinates: N 34 37.928 W 083 45.225 with plenty of parking nearby. When the trail seems to peter out, look left. My daughter who is 8 found the hidden trail. Look down. You are likely to find all kinds of wildlife tracks. Use stealth and you may be suprised at what you may see. . . . Cache is stocked with all kinds of goodies</groundspeak:long_description>

The trail was tough to find, part of it cut through someone's back yard, but I took the family and we were super excited when we found the cache!  There was about a half inch of water in the tuperware, but the treasures were still mostly in tact.  We took a couple treasures (toys for the kiddos) and left a couple treasures.  I also took a traveling bug that I intend to send on its way soon.  All in all it was a fun trip.  We continued up to Anna Ruby Falls, which was another first!</groundspeak:text>

This was the location of one of the first caches we found in Georgia. This is an awesome area and we felt that this cache needed to be brought back to life. This area has potential to be filled with muggles, use stealth when needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new container shouldn't have the issues that the last one had with leaks. With this remake of an old cache and our love of Star Wars, the name Return of the Cache seemed fitting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Eek37 for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Kituwah Mound&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land has always been honored and respected by the Cherokee. It is considered sacred and not to be abused. The land was honored by the Cherokee because the land contained the dust of their ancestors and this was the place where they were put by Unethlvnvhi - Creator - to live and to take care of. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And to the Cherokee, no place is more sacred than The Kituwah Mound. Located in a cool, green valley, nestled deep within the Great Smoky Mountains in Cherokee country, is an unimposing mound only 170 feet in diameter and five feet high. But its size belies its importance to the Cherokee. The was Kituwah, the place of the “first fire” establishing them as a people. This was Kituwah, a few hundred acres of pasture bordering the Tuckagee River of North Carolina, the place of the stories that the grandmothers told about, about the way the river turns, about the smell of the damp grass first thing in the morning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part of the 20th century it had been in the hands of others. Each spring, the European settlers plowed, cultivated and farmed the valley, each year the mound growing smaller and smaller, hidden by shoulder-high corn. In 1996, this land once again became Cherokee land. Since then the tribe has disagreed over the future of the property; some wanting economic development, the other for the spiritual preservation due to its significance as an historic site. In the end, it was ogana (groundhog) who pointed the way. More on that later. In the words of Tom Belt, now a counselor for at-risk Native American Youth, “It’s easy to imagine how this flat piece of land, surrounded by the peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains, was prized as a refuge. This was where the people were first given fire, this is where it all began. This place wasn’t just a town - this was like the Vatican. This was the Cherokee “holiest of holies.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the study of stone points found at Kituwah, some archaeologists estimate the site has been occupied for over 10,000 years. Pottery and other evidence indicate that the Cherokee have been here for at least 800 years. For centuries, the massive, round council house stood atop the mound, protecting the Cherokee’s sacred hearth - the fire. In annual ceremonies, the people would come to Kituwah from the surrounding settlements to light their fires from the source. James Mooney wrote in his 1900 ethnography Myths of the Cherokee that members of the tribe “frequently speak of themselves as Anikitu’hwagi and that the name was used in council to indicate genuine Cherokee feeling in its highest form.” Today, Kituwah lies near the Eastern Band’s Reservation, a time enclave where some 12,000 tribal members live. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no doubt that Kituwah Mound and the village that surrounded it were once the spiritual center of a nation that sprawled over seven modern states, equal in size to the present day Virginia, or half the size of Great Britain. The European invasion brought drastic changes to the Cherokee resulting in a series of punitive raids by British soldiers, who razed Kituwah in 1761 and 1776. Hardship, population pressure, and false treaties pushed the Cherokee farther and farther into the Great Smoky Mountains. And then there were the 16,000 or so Cherokee who were removed from their land by Andrew Jackson’s infamous Indian Removal Act, rammed through Congress in 1830. Thousands died on that journey - a journey that became known as the Trail of Tears - a journey where close to a fourth of their number died from hunger and exposure. A few managed to remain behind, foregoing their Cherokee ties to become US citizens but enabling them to stay in the remote valleys near Kituwah. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One spring recently a tribal member was working in his garden within sight of the Kituwah Mound when he came across part of a skull, a jawbone, and other human bones lying in loose dirt unearthed by ogana (groundhog). It didn’t take long for police to determine these were not recent bones. There were many who say ogana was an omen and joked that ogana was a true tribal archaeologist. There have been small excavations around the site, but the mound itself is too sensitive to touch. Instead, a device known as a flux-gradiometer that measures magnetic anomalies in the soil was used to authenticate the site. What emerged was a grainy, black and white image, showing the distinct outline of buried, burned walls that once belonged to a series of massive, round council houses built successively one on top of the other. In the center was a dark mass, the magnetic image of a centuries-old hearth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future of the site is still unclear, but preservationists and archaeologists are optimistic and tribal officials now say that large-scale development is unlikely. At Kituwah, the Cherokee took control of their history and put archaeologists to work in their interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local tribal members continue to hold picnics on the banks of the river, within sight of Kituwah. They keep the mound mowed, all except for a tuft of high grass at the very center. In among the tall grass are little piles of fresh, red dirt. They represent an old tradition. For centuries, visitors to the sacred mound brought earth from their hearths - from their homes - to add to the mound. In an emotional ceremony held in 1998, several hundred children from the reservation’s elementary school gathered at the mound. All of them had been asked to bring a bag of dirt from their homes to spread on the mound. To the delight of the organizers and teachers, not one came to school that day empty-handed. Standing on the mound, Tom Belt chokes up the memory. “You’re talking about kids who can’t speak Cherokee, who watch TV all the time. All of a sudden they reach back in time and say that’s part of who we are. The very first rebuilding of the mound, it was the children who did it. Our ancestors are buried here. That’s what they needed to see. When we begin to do these things again, who we are begins to mean something again.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: http://www.cherokeediscovery.com/kituwahmound.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, the Kituwah site was at the center of a major controversy involving Cherokee cultural heritage and big business. In December of 2009 Duke Energy began clearing a site which overlooked the Kituwah Mound site. They were planning to build a $52 million dollar electrical substation on the site, but had not consulted with tribal leaders or locals about the impact that such development would have on the sacred historical site. A grassroots movement quickly took shape and launched a campaign to Save Kituwah. Tribal leader from both the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as well as the Cherokee Nation and United Keetoowah Band all spoke out in opposition to the substation proposed site. The situation was widely reported and followed by the media throughout the country. Finally in early August of 2010, Duke Energy announced that they would move the planned substation to a new site away from Kituwah. The announcement marks a major victory for tribal community rights, cultural preservation, and grassroots political movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today you can view the village site and mound either from the highway or the walking and bird watching trail that leads by the mound and to the river. The trailhead coordinates to this listing were taken at the parking area along the highway at the entrance near the information sign placed by the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. The mound is enclosed by a picket fence, and only should be viewed from outside of the fence. There is a trail that enters from the East side of the mound and leads to the center to a small patch of red Earth, which is there for cultural purposes in the rebuilding of the mound. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as found, enter in the code phrase the number of the site information marker in the parking area. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At an altitude of 4,522 feet, in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, stands a most singular and significant monument to Freemasonry.  The Masonic Shrine or Marker, is a tribute to the universality of Masonry that should be viewed by all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located near Black Camp Gap, it is 17 miles from Waynesville, North Carolina, and is reached by taking Route 19 South through Lake Junaluska and Maggie Valley to Soco Gap and the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Head south on the Parkway toward Cherokee, and turn right onto the side road to Heintooga Overlook.  The Marker, which is accessed by a short paved walkway from a parking area, is identified with a plaque by the roadside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the efforts of Right Illustrious Companion T. Troy Wyche, Companion J. R. Boyd contributed one and one-half acres of land to the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of North Carolina during the Cryptic Year 1936-37.  At the 1937 Summer Assembly of York Rite Masons, a copper box, hermetically sealed and containing dated and Masonic memorabilia of that era, was locked into a black walnut box, and buried in a concrete vault at the Black Camp Gap property.  (In 1972, the box was unearthed, and the contents removed and placed in a display in Waynesville Masonic Lodge.  A new container, with items of that era, was placed back in the vault).  Companion T. Troy Wyche was already laying plans to mark the spot, and contacted Masonic Lodges, Grand Lodges, Grand York Rite Bodies, Scottish Rite Bodies, and any individuals of Masonic organizations interested in sending stones to be incorporated in the building of the monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the proceedings of the Grand Council's Annual Assembly in Greensboro, North Carolina, on May 10th, 1938:  &quot;To mark the spot where the Grand Council last year buried its Memorial Deposit, we conceive the idea of a Masonic Marker as a true symbol of the universality of Masonry, and therefore have requested Masons of all countries and states to contribute stones to go therein.  Interesting stones have come from five continents, the isles of the seven seas, and from historic spots of nearly every state in the Union.  The idea has caused manifestation of great interest in the United States and among (Masons in) foreign countries, and consciousness that Freemasonry does have a message for this troubled world.&quot;  (This was at a time when war clouds were gathering over Europe and we were destined to involvement in World War II.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work of constructing the Marker was under the supervision of a non-Mason, Oscar L. Briggs, Supt. of the Water Department in Waynesville, North Carolina.  The city contributed the labor and the trucks for hauling the materials to the site.  M.I. Companion Wyche compiled a catalog showing the location and giving a history and description of each stone.  The completed marker was unveiled and consecrated at the Summer Assembly on July 11th, 1938.  It was estimated that this was the largest group of Cryptic Masons, (over 600) ever to meet outside the General Grand Council.  There were ten Illustrious Grand Masters present, distinguished Masons from 21 states, Canada, Cuba, and the Canal Zone.  After preliminary ceremonies at the Masonic Temple in Waynesville, the group journeyed to Black Camp Gap for the unveiling and dedication.  Rt. Wor. Companion Thomas J. Harkins, Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina, made the dedication address.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T. Troy Wyche passed through the Ninth Arch and to his just reward on April 26, 1939.  That summer, the Grand Council voted to have an appropriate marker erected in his memory at the Shrine site at Black Camp Gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1941, M.I. Claude B. Hosaflook, then a Provincial Grand Master of the Grand Council, conceived a plan for a series of 3, 5, 7, and 9 steps and five landings leading up to the Marker.  These were cut from Georgia gray granite and taken to the site in the Fall of that year.  However, World War II delayed completion and dedication until September 1948.  The riser of each step bears the inscription of each donor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1949, the Blue Ridge Parkway took over the land on three sides of the Marker from the Boyd heirs, the Great Smoky Mountain National Park owning the remaining side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained in construction of the Marker are 687 separate items or memorial pieces, consisting of various types of stones, granite, quartz, marble, slate, jade, onyx, tile, brick, crystal, gypsum, fluorspar, agate, garnet, fossil stone, and petrified wood.  The stones are reported to vary in weight from one ounce to a 170-pound stone from a Cuban fortress constructed by Don Hernando DeSoto in the 1500's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Marker was not destined to contain the Memorial Chest, since it remained buried in its concrete vault. It is alleged that the plans for the monument were drawn by Companion Wyche, it being 12 feet high and 9 feet square at the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a protection against vandalism, an iron fence was erected around the Marker in 1954.  Due to some deterioration from the weather, a wooden covering was constructed through Grand Council efforts around 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of primary significance was the enthusiasm and cooperation of Masonic Bodies throughout the world in contributing to the Shrine Freemasonry's belief in the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man is more appreciated when viewing the tranquil and scenic setting of the Marker.  The universality of our great Fraternity was truly was truly demonstrated in a tangible manner, but let us not forget that all of the stones contributed would be nothing more than a pile of rubble were it not for the cement that binds them together.  It is the responsibility of each member of the Craft to make certain that the cement of Brotherly Love and Affection continues to hold us together as Masons, as Brothers, and as the children of God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/Great_Smoky_Mountains_Masonic_Monument.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, enter as the pass word, enter what is written on 33rd step in the stairs leading up to the Masonic marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park in Balsam Mountain at the Heintooga overlook. The terrain in this area is very steep and there are few trails that are passable. Getting lost is very easy. Native Americans and early settlers used Trail Trees and other means of marking trails. Here at the posted coordinates at 5416 feet elevation is a hole drilled in stone with a line carved marking a direction away from the hole. To log this listing as a find, use a compass to determin the bearing direction and degree that the line points away from the hole, and enter this information in the code phrase. Round off the degree to the nearest 10 th. Example: 10, 20, 30, ect. And the direction. Example: 220° South West.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There is an organization dear to our hearts dedicated to feeding the hungry of East Tennessee. Recently, they relocated their operations to the site of this cache. We had conversations with some of the good folks there and the subject of geocaching came up. They were very interested and even suggested we hide one near them. Thus, this cache was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camoed 35mm film canister hidden in a unique manner. This was inspired by a cache we found hidden by Popeye &amp; Olive. Access is gained from the walking path. No need to venture beyond any fences. Log only, BYOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE hide back as well or better than you found it to preserve the integrity of the difficulty rating. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and happy hunting!


Ol'Fogies&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. It is manufactured by the Raytheon Company of the United States. The Patriot System replaced the Nike Hercules system as the U.S. Army's primary High to Medium Air Defense (HIMAD) system, and replaced the MIM-23 Hawk system as the U.S. Army's medium tactical air defense system. In addition to these roles, Patriot has been given the function of the U.S. Army's anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system, which is now Patriot's primary mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high performance radar systems. Patriot was developed at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, which had previously developed the Safeguard ABM system and its component Spartan and Sprint missiles. The symbol for Patriot is a drawing of a Revolutionary War-era Minuteman.&lt;br/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, enter in the code phrase what the plaque says this display is in honor of.&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

During excavation of the area in 1881, several artifacts were discovered including burials. Many of the artifacts were sent to the Smithsonian. The land was owned by the McMahan family at the time of the excavation &amp; thus the mound was named the McMahan Indian Mound. The mound measures 16 feet high and 240 feet in circuference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the mound has a historic marker at the edge of the parkway. There is also a beautiful flower lined path that leads to a raised marker that indicates that the mound was conveyed to the city of Sevierville by the Temple family on December 28, 1987 &amp; that the site should not be disturbed due to its archeological &amp; historic signifance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will only take a few moments to stop and view this historic site. It is a nice way to pay tribute to the Native Americans that once lived on this land and roamed this valley. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, visit the site and locate a marker at the beginning of the sidewalk that leads to the plaque that tells about the mound being conveyed to the City of Sevierville by the Temple family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the pass word as to who the sidewalk is in memory of.      </groundspeak:long_description>

Sevierville, Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local country doctor, Dr. Robert F. Thomas, delivered Dolly on Jan. 19, 1946, near Locust Ridge, Tenn. (Sevier County). He was paid a sack of cornmeal for his work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sevierville claims the birth place of the famous Dolly Parton. Dolly came from a large family and is one of eleven children. Her first real break came when she performed at the Grand Ole Opry at the young age of 13. She was also featured on local radio stations. She then teamed up with Porter Wagoner to co-host his television show. This helped to bring her notoriety. Eventually, her musical career grew and she went out on her own, making several musical hits, her own television show, and starring in several big budget movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dolly loves the Tennessee mountains and invested her time and energy into opening up a first class theme park featuring top country music artists, amusement rides, and musical reviews which she named Dollywood. It helped to shift the country music scene to Sevierville and several excellent country music clubs opened up which featured up and coming stars along with big name talent.&lt;br/&gt;Dollywood, the theme park, is just up the road in Pigeon Forge, but we prefer this little celebrity landmark on the lawn of the Sevier County Courthouse. The statue is a life-size bronze, part of a 28-stop downtown walking tour of Dolly's hometown. Nearly everyone claims to know her personally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under a shady tree, the figure by artist Jim Gray depicts the young, starry-eyed Dolly, barefoot, sitting on a rock with her guitar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, locate a granite monument on the ground to Dolly's left and post in the code phrase who it is dedicated to. Use the last three words on the monument in lower case in the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on the log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lesser Known Facts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The only state that grows coffee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) There is no racial or ethnic majorities here, everyone is a minority&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who's found them all?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in a Knoxville park, with over a half mile hike from the parking area, depending on which trail you take, (if) you stay on a trail. The cache is a thin ammo box about 170' off the nearest trail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area has been developed into a Mtn. Bike/Hiking trail park by local volunteers and has a great trail system in it. Go here for trail map (http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~dunigan/mtnbike/icking.html ).&lt;br/&gt;Its best to park at this location: N35 53.794 W083 57.108.&lt;br/&gt;The trailhead is at the N.E. end of the parking lot along the lakeshore. After a rain, some sections of the trail will be muddy and the Park gate will be closed at night.&lt;br/&gt;There is an active railroad track just North of the park. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO ON THE RR TRACKS. The trail goes a short distance along the lakeshore and then into the woods. There are numerous trails near the cache and this cache can be reached by boat when the lake levels are up.&lt;br/&gt;There is an interesting site near this cache. </groundspeak:long_description>

Good luck in Nashville, Tricia, and thanks for the hide and trusting us to look after it for you!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first in a series of caches placed in and around the
Knoxville area. This series will take you to some of the more
cultural and historical landmarks that are significant to Knoxville
and Knox County. The cache is only available during the following
hours: Monday through Friday: 7:30 am - 6:00 pm Saturday: 9:00 am -
5:00 pm Sunday: 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm. Free parking is available at
N35 58.021 W083 55.159. Look for the &quot;Visitor Parking&quot; signs.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Your first stop in Knoxville should be the downtown Visitor
Center. It's no ordinary &quot;grab-a-brochure-and-go&quot; kind of place.
There's the studio of Americana and roots radio station WDVX, live
lunchtime music with &quot;Blue Plate Special,&quot; gourmet coffee,
fresh-baked goods, the finest locally made gifts and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each weekday at 12 noon, a live bluegrass set (the Blue Plate
Special) is broadcast on WDVX from the stage just inside the
building. The public is welcome and highly encouaged to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover a fun, friendly place plus all the information and
advice you need to make the most of your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to housing Knoxville's Visitor Center, One Vision
Plaza is the headquarters for the Knoxville Tourism &amp; Sports
Corporation and the Knoxville Tourism Alliance (KTA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renovated building was originally built in the early 1900's.
Its most recent tenant was a Wendy's restaurant, but the structure
has been vacant since 1991. The property was acquired by the KTSC
from the Tennessee Valley Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of One Vision Plaza was conceived and executed by the
Knoxville firm Johnson Architecture. The designers transformed a
traditional, linear layout into a concept utilizing curving walls
and features that echo the curving lines of the KTSC / Knoxville
logo and its sun, mountain and water design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the cache, you must enter the building and locate the
box inside. It is not hard to find, as it is setting right out in
the open and not cammo'd in anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is room for small-to-medium trade items and there is a
logbook and pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever is FTF will get the brand new bison tube in the box!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Director of the Visitor's Center has given us permission to
place a cache here. In fact, she was the one who decided where the
box would be placed. After finding the cache, please make sure to
thank those working there for letting us place a cache in their
establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

They enjoyed all the things to see and checking out the TBs in the cache and we enjoyed just chilling for a bit and having a nice warm drink.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Geocache is in the Dog walk area just before the West bound I-81/40 split at the Rest Stop. &lt;br/&gt;We stopped here many a times with the dogs to let them walk on the way to Del Rio to hunt Hogs and Bear.  I used to have a big dog box that was custom made to lock to a 5th wheel reciever in the back of a Dulley with two fuel tanks. One was for hauling Moonshine. I grew up in a time where a shine running bootlegger could make a living as a chicken farmer. That's how I met my hunting friends down in Parrottsville. Newport is famous for Cock Fighting, and I was a Chicken Farmer. &lt;br/&gt;We always brought some &quot;Popcorn Likker&quot; back every time we made a trip to Newport or Del Rio. Sometimes we could buy flavored shine that was from North Carolina, and all the folks wanted what they called Apple Pie.&lt;br/&gt;Ain't no need to break any Laws now if you want a sip of shine. Seems the Johnson's over in the Piedmont went legal, and Ole' Hank William's jr. backed this apprientice of Marvin &quot;Popcorn&quot; Sutton and now they have a distillery in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Sutton took his own life on the day he was to report to prison for Federal charges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marvin &quot;Popcorn&quot; Sutton (October 5, 1946 – March 16, 2009) was an American Appalachian moonshiner originally from Maggie Valley, North Carolina.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Bootlegging and moonshining career&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Sutton's career in bootlegging—and getting caught for it—extended back to the 1970s. In 1999, Sutton published Me and My Likker, an autobiography and guide to moonshine production. He was featured in a 2007 documentary Hillbilly: The Real Story, on The History Channel. In 2008, he was featured in the documentary The Last One, filmed by Neal Hutcheson. In November 2010, Hank Williams, Jr. announced a partnership (including Sutton's widow) to distill and distribute Sutton's whiskey legally for the first time.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Sutton considered moonshine production a legitimate part of his heritage, being as he was Scots-Irish and descended from a long line of moonshiners. In January 2009, after an ATF raid led by Jim Cavanaugh of Waco fame. Sutton was sentenced to eighteen months in a federal prison for illegally distilling spirits and possession of a firearm as a felon. Sutton, 62 and recently diagnosed with cancer, pleaded with the U.S. District Judge Ronnie Greer to let him serve his sentence under house arrest. Several petitions were made in attempts to reduce or commute Sutton's sentence, to no avail. In sentencing, the judge specifically referred to the documentary about him.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;He was a short, skinny fella, who always wore his hat—that was kind of his claim to fame, his hat that he always wore. And his bib overalls—he always wore bib overalls. Even when he came to federal court, he was wearing bib overalls. He was a friendly fellow, and of course every time you would talk to him, he would say, 'Ray, I’ve run my last run of moonshine, I'm not gonna do it anymore, I'm just getting too old to be doing this suff.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Sutton committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on March 16, 2009, apparently to avoid a federal prison term due to begin a few days later. On October 24, 2009, Sutton's body was relocated from his original grave site in Mt. Sterling, North Carolina, to his home in Parrottsville, Tennessee, providing an opportunity for the first public memorial service to be held. He traveled to his final resting spot by horse and carriage. Sutton's memorial grew in spectacle as country music singer Hank Williams, Jr. flew in to pay his respects. It was a small memorial only for close friends and family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nickname&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the 1960s or 70s, Sutton was given the nickname of &quot;Popcorn&quot; Sutton after damaging a bar's faulty popcorn vending machine with a pool cue.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;On Nov. 9, 2010, Hank Williams, Jr. announced his partnership with J&amp;M Concepts LLC and widow Pam Sutton to distill and distribute Sutton's whiskey legally for the first time. Dubbed &quot;Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey,&quot; it is produced on stills designed by Sutton prior to his death, using his secret family recipe and techniques Sutton entrusted to former Supercross professional Jamey Grosser of J&amp;M Concepts. Country music stars attending the launch event included Martina McBride, Jamey Johnson, Randy Houser, Travis Tritt, Tanya Tucker, Zac Brown, Josh Thompson, Kentucky Headhunters, Little Big Town, Colt Ford, Montgomery Gentry, Jaron and the Long Road to Love and Lee Brice. According to press reports, Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey will be initially distributed in Tennessee and throughout the southeast. The copper stills were handcrafted by Vendome Copper and Brass in Louisville, KY.&lt;br/&gt;Source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Sutton&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Although all that remains is the lower portion of the original 1819 30-foot-high blast furnace, it is actually a very small part of what was originally an entire complex known as the Newlee Iron Furnace. The furnace itself required considerable investment and was located here not by chance by because of the resources mentioned by Dr. Thomas Walker in 1750. The furnace itself was built 25 to 30 feet high with a hearth or a crucible where the molten iron was collected, perhaps a foot or two deep and three or four feet wide. Just above the hearth the opening flared outward and was termed the &quot;bosh.&quot; The bosh was about eight feet in diameter at its widest and narrowed as it converged toward the top. The outside of the furnace was built of sandstone with a liner of firebrick. Furnaces were usually built with an incline just behind to ease charging and loading. The trestle leading to the charging point was usually built of heavy planks with a track on it. Men, often slaves, would roll wheelbarrows of raw materials over this trestle and dump them into the top of the furnace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To produce one ton of iron, the furnace required an exact recipe of 200 bushels of charcoal, 2 tons of iron ore, and 500 pounds of limestone, all of which would be lit and joined inside the furnace. A waterwheel-powered bellows kept the fires hot. It took 4 to 6 hours to produce molten iron, with a layer of slag floating on top. The slag would be drained off through the &quot;cinder hole,&quot; and then the molten iron would be drained through the &quot;tap hole&quot; below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The slag would be added to the slag heap still visible in front of the furnace today, but the molten iron would be allowed to run down a narrow crevice in the sand into a corresponding and larger trench in the sand to cool into pig iron. The daily product of the Newlee Iron Furnace was 3¼ tons, at a cost of $19.40 per ton in 1877 figures. The iron made at Cumberland Gap was shipped down Powell River to Chattanooga. This furnace was the only furnace in the Dyestone belt still using charcoal in 1877.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This structure was used during the nineteenth century as a charcoal blast furnace for smelting iron. Probably built between 1813 and 1835 by Martin Beaty, it was operated intermittently until about 1881, by a number of people including John G. Newlee for whom the foundry was named at the end of the century. The foundry and buildings were used for ammunition storage for a part of the Civil War. This foundry is considered one of the last examples of a cold-blast charcoal furnace.  The furnace is located at the base of Cumberland Mountain, next to Gap Creek near Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, at an elevation of 1350 feet. In 1870, the foundry group consisted of the blast furnace itself, a 25' x 26', 35'-high limestone chimney lined with firebrick; a casting shed, a 15' x 20' single story frame building connected to the south; a 2 1/2-story, 30' x 45' storehouse to the north, with a 30' overshot water wheel to power the blast machinery; and a fleming mill detached from the complex nearby. Presently the site includes the 30' remains of the blast furnace, a grass-covered slag pile, a large stone with drill-holes for splitting it, and a portion of a flume, cut to channel Gap Creek around the foundry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This structure was used during the nineteenth century as a charcoal blast furnace for smelting iron.

Today only the creek and part of the original 30-foot-high stone tower remain, a small part of an industrial complex of buildings, slag heaps, and machinery then called the Newlee Iron Frunace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the ingredients needed to make iron were nearby: iron-ore deposits close to the surface, limestone, abundant firewood to be made into charcoal for fuel, and waterpower to run the air bellows and a massive hammer mill. Some iron made here was sold to local blacksmiths. Some of the 150-pound ingots or 'pigs' were shipped down the Powell River to Chattanooga, Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What It took every day to produce 3 tons of Iron was, 625 bushels of charcoal, 16.5 cords of wood (52 average size trees), 6 1/4 tons of Iron Ore, and 1,563 lbs Limestone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A typical early-1800s ironworks needed a hammer mill and bellows next to the tower, as well as a way to continually dump charcoal and ore into the top of the chimney. For the Newlee Iron Furnace, the exact positions of these components are not known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontier-era ironworks had an enormous appetite for firewood. During the 60 years iron was refined in this tower, more than 10 square miles of trees went up in smoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, visit the area and enter in the code phrase the origin of the creek that powered the air bellows and hammer mill to the furnace.&lt;br/&gt;     </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cumberland Gap is a pass through the Cumberland Mountains region of the Appalachian Mountains, also known as the Cumberland Water Gap, at the junction of the U.S. states of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. Famous in American history for its role as one key passageway through the lower central Appalachians, it was an important part of the Wilderness Road and is now part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. Long used by Native Americans, the Cumberland Gap was brought to the attention of settlers in 1750 by Dr. Thomas Walker, a Virginia physician and explorer. The path was widened by a team of loggers led by Daniel Boone, making it accessible to pioneers who used it to journey into the western frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cumberland Gap is located just north of the spot where the current-day states of Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia meet. The nearby town of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee takes its name from the pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The gap was named for Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, who had many places named for him in the American colonies after the Battle of Culloden. The explorer Thomas Walker gave the name to the Cumberland River in 1750, and the name soon spread to many other features in the region, such as the Cumberland Gap. In 1769 Joseph Martin built a fort nearby at present-day Rose Hill, Virginia, on behalf of Dr. Walker's land claimants. But Martin and his men were chased out of the area by Native Americans, and Martin himself did not return until 1775.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1775 Daniel Boone, hired by the Transylvania Company arrived in the region leading a company of men to widen the path through the gap to make settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee easier. On his arrival, Boone discovered that Martin had beaten him to Powell Valley, where Martin and his men were clearing land for their own settlement – the westernmost settlement in English colonial America at the time. By the 1790s the trail that Boone and his men built was widened to accommodate wagon traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several American Civil War engagements were centered in and around the Cumberland Gap and are sometimes called Battle of the Cumberland Gap. In June 1862, Union Army General George W. Morgan captured the gap for the Union. In September of that year, Confederate States Army forces under Edmund Kirby Smith occupied the Gap during General Braxton Bragg's Kentucky Invasion. The following year, in a bloodless engagement in September 1863, Union Army troops under General Ambrose Burnside forced the surrender of 2,300 Confederates defending the gap, gaining Union control of the gap for the remainder of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 migrants passed through the gap on their way into Kentucky and the Ohio Valley before 1810. Today 18,000 cars pass beneath the site daily, and 1,200,000 people visit the park on the site annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Route 25E passed overland through the gap before the completion of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1996. The original trail was then restored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Joseph Martin, explorer, long hunter, and later general, was an early settler at Cumberland Gap. The gap and associated historic resources were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district on May 28, 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geological features:The 12-mile (19 km) long Cumberland Gap consists of four geologic features: the Yellow Creek valley, the natural gap in the Cumberland Mountain ridge, the eroded gap in the Pine Mountain, and Middlesboro crater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Middlesboro crater is a 3-mile (4.8 km) diameter meteorite impact crater in which Middlesboro, Kentucky, is located. The crater was identified in 1966 when Robert Dietz discovered shatter cones in sandstone, which led to the further identification of shocked quartz. Shatter cones, a rock shattering pattern naturally formed only during impact events, are found in abundance in the area. In September 2003 the site was designated a Distinguished Geologic Site by the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without Middlesboro crater, it would have been difficult for packhorses to navigate this gap and improbable that wagon roads would have been constructed at an early date. Middlesboro is the only place in the world where coal is mined inside an impact crater. Special mining techniques must be used in the complicated strata of this crater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Panoramic view from Pinnacle Overlook at Cumberland Gap National Historic ParkThe gap was formed by an ancient creek, flowing southward, which cut through the land being pushed up to form the mountains. As the land rose even more, the creek reversed direction flowing into the Cumberland River to the north. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At these posted coordinates one can also view the balanced rock and chimney rock, both highlights of this tourist destination from the Pinnacle Overlook. &lt;br/&gt;Here on the railing around the Overlook you can find the name of the company that manufactured it. Enter in the code phrase the name of the company as it is written and the date.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources other than my own: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Gap  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Near the point where Tennessee, Virginia and Kentucky come together is a place that played an important role in the Civil War, even though there were no major battles fought here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Union Army, this was known as Fort McCook.  To the Confederates, it was known as Fort Rains. Either way, this spot was used intensely by both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northern troops had hoped to use the site to gain access to valuable minerals and railroads in the region surrounding it.   For Southern forces, this was a place to start an invasion of Kentucky, one that would hopefully  drive out their Federal Foes once and for all.  Of course, the hopes of both sides never materialized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort McCook/Ft. Rains is located just off the Pinnacle Road inside the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park.   It overlooks the city of Middlesboro, KY and the historic &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot;,  one of only a handful of  natural passageways through the Cumberland Plateau. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, some of the original earthen fortifications built during the Civil War remain visible.  There is also a cannon aimed at the town below.  During the course of the war,  control of the Cumberland Gap and the area around it changed hands four times.  Eventually, General Ulysses S. Grant visited the area and decided that it was unusable as an invasion route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the posted coordinates there is a sign with a quote from Colonel James Ewdard Rains, Garrison Commander, March, 22nd 1862.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;At daybreak skrimishing parties of the enemy opened fire.. from the adjacent hills....&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Enter in the code phrase the next two words to log this listing as a find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Native Americans were living in the Rose Hill area since the time of the earliest Native Americans, called the Paleoindians. Evidence of their presence here is a rare type of projectile point called a Clovis point. Clovis points have been found in nearby Ewing and Clovis points have reportedly been found in the eastern section of the Rose Hill district. This mound is a landmark along the Daniel Boone Trail, or Wilderness Road as it is still known today near another more well known landmark to the pioneers travling West, The White Rocks of the Cumberland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all Native American groups traveled through western Lee County without staying. One group did build permanent structures and became residents. The Ely Mound is a well-known example. This mound, the best preserved mound in Virginia, is a special type of mound called a “temple mound”. It is the only temple mound known in the entire state of Virginia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can see the Ely Mound across the four-lane from this location where the State Historical marker and a Daniel Boone Trail marker are located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing, enter the number of the information marker at the viewing area to the mound in the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

All it contains is a log sheet. Use the hint, it may help. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 Poles look out is a resting place in the open, just some big boulders and power poles on a hill on trail #27. It's 0.51 miles line of sight from here to the Mason Jar Trailhead. &lt;br/&gt;If you ever ride here, mark this location. You may need it. There is a emergency exit at the bottom of the hill and the gates stay locked, but it will take you off the moutain and it is one of the trails that Jeeps can navagate. Also there are a few landing zones for Med Flight to land their helicopter.  One is between here and the Mason Jar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://harlancountytrails.com/blackmountain.php</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is located along the trail called the Mason Jar in Black Mountain Adventure Park. Finding the geocache should not be a problem once that you reach GZ, but getting there is not a easy task. It's in a OHV Park, and it's not easy whatever means that you use to reach GZ at 3057 feet elevation full of rocky terrain and mud holes. Also there is a fee to use the OHV Park, I'll post a link to their site so you may be advised. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mason Jar has to be one of the baddest trails in the Park, it's a rock crawler trail that eats Jeeps. We enjoy riding our ATV's here, and when the Park is not too busy we come up here in my 4x4 Truck, but stay on the main trails that are rated class 3 or less. I have set here at GZ and watched people destroy Jeeps and Rock Crawlers just trying to get over the boulders at the trailhead. It's really a great view from here. When I placed this geocache it was Mothers Day and we were on a family outing on a rainy day. It was quite muddy and we made a slow 3 hour trip up trail 10 to Middle Fork and around trail 12 to Malfunction Junction, then to 4 poles overlook, and then to the Mason Jar trailhead. That is about a 12 mile round trip back to the trailhead near Evarts, Kentucky.

This is a intersection where 5 trails meet, and the exit to the Mason Jar trail is here. Also there is a main trail that leads to the Lion's Den which is another Rock Crawler trail, ATV's and common Jeeps need not attempt. This area also can be used for a LZ for Med Flight. It is a wide spot on top of the mountain, and there is a trail map shelter here. It's real easy to get lost here because many ATV trails are not marked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://harlancountytrails.com/blackmountain.php &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is on the north side of the mountain overlooking Putney, Ky. near the Middle Fork Trail. &quot;Paco&quot; was a guinea pig, we bought him at Pet-Smart in Bristol Va. about 3 years ago. He loved carrots. Paco passed away last week and the cache container, well it was what we kept his feed in. So I cameo painted it and made a geocache container. It has a log book and some S.W.A.G. in it. Enjoy, and think about Paco running up your coat sleave or pants leg when you are reaching for the cache.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DISCLAIMER: Cache owner does not in any manner direct or indirect endorse or otherwise promote rash or dangerous behavior.

It was archived by me because of all the whiney geocachers that have been unable to find the geocache, and I got tired of arguing with users about the geocache being in place and findable. It's there, maybe I can post a spoiler photo that will help?&lt;br/&gt;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC1M1ND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

You should get a decent view of the old Howard's Mill Dam.&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of parking is available within 60ft of cache. Even though this cache is located out in the country this is a popular fishing hole so watch for muggles day and night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Info&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howards Mill was the site of an old water mill of ambitious proportion and capacity for its time, long before steam was introduced, built on Slate Creek and operated by the Howards -- an old and famous mercantile family of the county. Capt. James Howard, for a long time postmaster at Mt. Sterling, and prior thereto County Court Clerk, was of that family. The mill dam stood the test of many years and floods. Then Mt. Sterling installed water works for the city, the waters of Slate Creek impounded by the dam were readily available for an adequate supply. A mural of the mill and dam may be seen on the wall of the Montgomery Hotel at Mt. Sterling. The village is about six miles southeast of Mt. Sterling.&lt;br/&gt;Howard's Mill is in the near vicinity of Morgan's Station, a block house rendezvous built by the first settlers as protection against Indian forays. It was the only one in what is now Montgomery County, and was, in April 1793 attacked by Wyandotte Indians on their last invasion of Kentucky, one of the last to occur in that part of the state. The Indians surprised and took the fort, carrying away a number of women and children, some of whom were killed, but some were returned after the peace of 1795. That was before Mt. Sterling was settled. Beside the strategic location of Morgan's Station, Howard's Mill is on the road from Mt. Sterling to Olympia Springs, long a noted watering place resort. It was near also the Forge Iron Works on Slate Creek, where iron ores were smelted and made into cannon balls that served General Jackson at New Orleans. In those times the Howards Mill settlement was of some note. When steam was substituted for water power and the rich ore deposits of the northwest outmoded Old Forge, and the roadhouse took over the pleasure seekers who erstwhile made Olympia famous, old Howards Mill fell into &quot;innocuous desuetude&quot; as an active business center. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

With his permission, I replaced it so other cachers will get a chance to see the old bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should be able to park pretty close to the cache location unless there are tree branches or floodwaters across the old road.  On the day I placed the cache there was a tree branch across the road and there was standing water on the bridge.  Sure glad this was long ago closed to traffic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Had to re-hide this cache due to muggles.  This is probably a popular hangout for local youth with too much free time, so the cache is pretty well hidden.  I would recommend approaching from Freestone Road end to avoid parking on or near private property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF congrats to &quot;hereonthehill&quot;!

your way to Lexington.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why are this church and cemetery named Siloam? Siloam, it turns out
is a Biblical name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;John 9:6-7 (New International Version)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;6 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with
the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. 7 Go,he told him, wash in
the Pool of Siloam(this word means Sent. So the man went and
washed, and came home seeing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Pool of Siloam was a rock-cut pool on the southern slope of the
City of David, the original site of Jerusalem, located outside the
walls of the Old City to the southeast. The pool was fed by the
waters of the Gihon Spring, carried there by two aqueducts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the summer of 2004 Eli Shukrun, Ronny Reich, and John Seligman,
who were checking the area southeast of the traditional Pool of
Siloam for a public works project, discovered a pool that they date
to the first centuries B.C. and A.D. In all probability it is the
Pool of Siloam mentioned in John 9:7 to which Jesus sent a blind
man to wash a mud mixture from his eyes.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The most famous Forest Lawn Cemeteries and Memorial Parks are located in California and are the resting places of many well-known celebrities. However, many other cities and towns have cemeteries with the same famous name. Morehead is one of those towns, and you are invited to visit another Forest Lawn Cemetery to hunt this geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quick internet hunt turned up at least one famous person who was laid to rest here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STEVE HAMILTON: Major League Baseball Player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 6-foot-7 left-handed relief specialist, he broke into the major leagues with the Cleveland Indians in 1961. He also pitched for the Washington Senators, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs. For his career he compiled a 40-31 record, a 3.05 earned run average and 42 saves. He was 34-20 in his seven years with the Yankees. He made just 17 career starts (10 with Washington in 1962) during his 421 appearances. He also played basketball two years for the Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball Association after being a star at Morehead State University. He served as baseball coach and athletic director at Morehead after he left the big leagues. (bio by: Ron Coons)&lt;/p&gt;

Little undergrowth and most of the steep hills and drops are short – except one.  On the map you will see a little blue bypass.  And on the trail you will see a sign that says “easy” and “expert”.  I tried the expert and got half way up the other side before I fell off the bike!  Expert is no exaggeration!  J &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can download a gpx file of the “track” from my trip.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It's a long story about how we came to find this cache. I'll keep it short.  We were working on The Bernoulli Ultimatum - A Green Cell Mission and were on our way to one of the stages. So far we'd been successful.  Low and behold, we run into ghs.  We talked for a little while and he gave us the coordinates for this cache.  I had loaded some of the other new ones in my GPS, but somehow missed this one.  We DNFd the next stage of the Bernoulli Untimatum so rather than leave the park completely downtrodden, we made our way over to the coordinates provided by ghs and got ourselves a smiley.  So all in all, it turned out to be a good day after all. We'll be back to finish the other one soon.  This was our 100th Find in the State of Ohio. TFTC!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was an adventure! I started out at the Ward Road Parking lot and first headed out to grab CC PC View since it was so close to the parking lot.  That hike lasted about 1 minute before the trail ended and water began.  Change of plans.

I decided to try to grab some of the caches on the other trail.  So I headed for the Smokies.  Got about 1/4 mile down the trail and ran into water again. (See photograph).  I figured it was time to start bushwhacking.  That proved to be a good choice.  Note: There aren't too many briers/thorns in this area.  Made it to the cache okay and it was in great shape.  I took a TB from the cache to move along.  Thanks for placing this cache.  I'm looking forward to coming back for the rest once the water recedes.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I caught a lot of grief from the geocachers near East Fork Lake for hiding micros along the mountain bike trail.  Although I've hidden dozens of caches along other bike trails without any negative feedback before - the fact this trail was in the middle of the woods got people hankering for a big, meaty cache.  Since the customer is always right - I strapped on my backpack and hauled 3 regular size caches out here.  Some along the trail will still be smalls, but I hope they will all be satisfying...  So bring your swag!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located on the Caesar Creek Turkey Run mountain bike trail.

After arriving at the Center Road parking lot, we set-off on foot to grab three caches hoping we would garner a STF on all three caches.  On our way there we passed two caches we found earlier in the week, Hail to Caesar Creek - Campground Trail and What a Gas!  We continued on down the trail not passing anyone on foot or on a bike and made our way down the trail and found Road Block cache.  We were STF on that cache. We continued on down to Lake View cache and found it quickly.  We were STF there too.  Then we were off for our final geocaching adventure to search for Size Matters.  Once at GZ we found the cache quickly.  Found at 6:05 p.m.  We left a coin from a foreign country and took the Geocoin.  STF and our find #138.

There is much less underbrush and there seemed to be fewer hills that had me get off the bike.  The South Ward trail offers super views of the lake the North some neat creeks and ravines.  There are some good maps available on the referenced webpage.  If anyone is interested I can email you a gpx file of my “track” that can be uploaded in a GPS.  There’s couple of places you can make a “wrong”  turn along the way (the connector to another trail and the access to the Brimstone Road trailhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several access points (I’ll be placing some caches near some)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ward Road parking is here (Parking for 10 cars): N39 31.369 W83 58.664&lt;br/&gt;There is access from Brimstone Road here (parking for 1 car): N39 30.519 W83 58.166&lt;br/&gt;Where the South Ward trail intersects Ward road (no parking): N39 30.753 W83 58.092&lt;br/&gt;Where to access the North Ward Road trail (no parking); N39 30.850 W83 58.302&lt;br/&gt;Intersection with Harveysburg Trail connector:  N39 30.716 W83 58.650&lt;br/&gt;Intersection with Brimstone Trailhead connector:  N39 30.592 W83 58.235&lt;br/&gt;Intersection of N Ward Trail and Turkey Run Trail: N39 31.219 W83 58.349</groundspeak:long_description>

The loop trail itself is about 2.4 miles ( a little shorter if you return the way you came). I got to the Turkey Run trail head taking the western loop of the Campground mountain bike trail (the intersection is about 1.3 mile from the trail head near the parking at Center Rd. One website listed the Campground trail as “easy”, but lack of maintenance kicks it up a notch (huge tree across trail, collapsed bridge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same website lists Turkey run as “easy” and that is flat out wrong. There are a couple hills so steep I had to push the bike up and walk down plus other technical challenges on the way to this spot.

After sending two members of the Team BMR expedition party out to claim the land for our own and grab the FTF, I was able to find the time to make my way out to Cache-istan to verify our dominance and sign my name to the land grant treaty. There were enemy sea vessels all over the landing area, making for some tricky going while trying to avoid the large submarine torpedo induced wakes as the shrapnel exploded all around me. Apparently, the insurgents are back near North Cachi-istan and trying to to take control of Cache-istan proper as well. I was able to maintain control of Cache-istan for Team BMR but it wasn't easy - had I been with the other members of my team, I might have made easier work of the enemy as they could have created diversions as I sent out RPG fire to disable the enemy boats.

Team BMR has decreed that no boats with motors are allowed to access the island. If you attempt to find this cache with a boat powered by anything other than a paddle, your vessel will be summarily shot with a torpedo and sunk on site. And just think, each sunken boat will provide a nice location for off shore reefs which will enable us to develop a very diverse ecosystem near our lands. This will also cut down on the terrible diversity depletion effects of oil in the lake near our shore...

Thanks for a great paddle!!!!

I also made entry to the lake from the Ward Rd. area, which makes for a good paddle including a nice stretch of open water to get to the island.

Thanks! SL</groundspeak:text>

For a local MVG event, I came down to claim this land for Team BMR and then provide a shuttle service to the local island resorts for other adventure craving cachers. As usual, the crazy Mr. Boyd showed up at 7:30 bringing lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and whitecaps to the parking location - I don't know what he did but mother nature sure is pissed at him .

After a brief discussion concerning our plan of attack, we revisited Cache-istan in order to verify my rein and Mr. Boyd signed the log on his first visit to my province. Although we took no enemy fire, mother nature threw her worst at us and we knocked it out like Mississippi River Boat Captains, adjusting here, tweaking there and finally making it around to the area of North Cache-istan.

As we got to ground zero, we spied another canoe but we didn't see the owners of the boat on our travels so they must have been friendly tourists - and since I am a benevolent ruler, I take no issue with the sightseers. After a brief bout with the elements and our inability to read our instruments on account of the deluge, we quickly had the cache in hand and the log was signed.

Because we were on the lake early, we didn't encounter too many enemy vessels and torpedo induced wakes - all of the adventure came from the thunderstorm mr. boyd brought with him.

Thanks for another great island cache! SL</groundspeak:text>

An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caches in the series are:&lt;br/&gt;Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM &lt;br/&gt;Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR &lt;br/&gt;Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV&lt;br/&gt;Earth   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKW&lt;br/&gt;Mars      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM1&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM3&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMA&lt;br/&gt;Saturn    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMD&lt;br/&gt;Uranus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMJ&lt;br/&gt;Neptune   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMM&lt;br/&gt;Pluto    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYNB&lt;br/&gt;And bonus caches&lt;br/&gt;Eris http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN7&lt;br/&gt;Comets http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN5&lt;br/&gt;Meteors   http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYN2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caches in the series are:&lt;br/&gt;Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM &lt;br/&gt;Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR &lt;br/&gt;Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV&lt;br/&gt;Earth   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKW&lt;br/&gt;Mars      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM1&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM3&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMA&lt;br/&gt;Saturn    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMD&lt;br/&gt;Uranus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMJ&lt;br/&gt;Neptune   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMM&lt;br/&gt;Pluto    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYNB&lt;br/&gt;And bonus caches&lt;br/&gt;Eris http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN7&lt;br/&gt;Comets http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN5&lt;br/&gt;Meteors   http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYN2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is posted exclusively on Opencaching.com. It is slightly larger than a micro.  If you're familiar with a matchstick container, you'll know what to look for.  The cache is located at Miami Valley Memory Garden, just outside Beavercreek, OH.  This location offers one of the best views of the Beaver Valley between Beavercreek and Xenia, OH.  Parking is available near the cache location.  Please re-hide the container as good or better than you found it so that the next cacher can enjoy the experience as much as you did and to avoid theft of the container by potential muggles.  Bring your own pen. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

(European Black Pine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinus nigra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young trees have yellowish-brown
bark, but this darkens as the tree grows. Old trees have
distinctive, furrowed bark colored with patches of brown, white and
gray. The Austrian Pine often is confused with our native Red
Pine, but the latter has reddish-brown bark as well as other
distinctive traits. The Austrian Pine is native to central and
southern Europe, and Asia Minor. Originally introduced from Europe
in the mid-1700s, this fast growing pine is widely planted as an
ornamental. It is easily established and tolerates city conditions
better than most other kinds of pine trees. In Ohio, landscape
workers commonly plant this tree in parks. Also, it is found in
some of our state forests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So, I met up with drainhook today to climb this tree.   This was a really fun climb, a much different entry than most tree climbs.  I really wanted to try climbing the trunk but the surface was too smooth for me to kick-off of to grab the first branch.  I think it could be done, but maybe with different shoes.

TFTC and meeting up with me for this climb!</groundspeak:text>

There is plenty of room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My family and friends won't go anywhere with me because they know I will NEED to stop and cache along the way. I don't see anything wrong with that? Do you? &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Have you ever completed a Hook-Boot cache??&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Define completed, sir?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An incursion underwater to re-take an impregnable fortress held by an elite team of U.S. Marines, in order to sign your name on a piece of paper and earn a smiley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh. In that case, no sir.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a three stage multi-cache. You're going to get wet. You're going to climb.&lt;br /&gt;
I waded and swam between stages, but we had a boat for our gear. Depending on the water level, you may need a boat.&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like for anyone logging this as &quot;found&quot; to get to each stage. Pictures are highly encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is NOT in a bird house!!! Do not disturb the bird houses that may be at GZ.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our second “BoC” cache. BoC stands for Best of
Columbus and these caches will be placed throughout the city in
areas that we frequent and adore. This particular location has
rapidly become perhaps our favorite place in the city to walk
around and explore with our geodog Sam. Cache is available between
the hours of 7AM and 5PM, 7AM to 7PM during daylight savings time.
Make sure you are out by the posted hours because they do lock the
gates&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most prominent names in Columbus history can be
found interred here, as well as several governors and veterans of
nearly all American wars. Green Lawn Cemetery also boasts 360 acres
of trees, birds, and foraging woodland animals. The bridge near the
cache site was built in 1898 and is one of the best areas in the
cemetery for bird watching - over 200 species of birds have been
documented within the confines of the cemetery. You could literally
spend an entire day exploring the grounds and discovering hundreds
of unique headstones. While this cache is only one of two currently
hidden here, its enormity could easily support several more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located off the Nature Path and you can find the
entrance to the path near the intersection of Section 31 and the
giant boulder. There are also a few signs posted along the drive
that will direct you to the Nature Path. There are no headstones in
this area although you will need to exercise care when ascending
the slight embankment, hence the slight increase in difficulty.
Please remember to respect the residents if you do choose to
explore other areas after finding the cache. Remember to BYOP as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your geopooch and enjoy the walking trail. More
information about Green Lawn Cemetery can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenlawncolumbus.org&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;This Multi
Cache is located in a park full of muggles, Vandals, and Heathens.
Use Caution, and as much stealth as possible when hunting this
cache.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;You will

&lt;strong&gt;The story
is one that you will make for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">  Greetings Tree People!
&lt;p&gt;This Tree ID Cache is a little
different than previous efforts, in that you are getting two for
the price of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is This a Multi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to acces the
&lt;strong&gt;Honey Locust&lt;/strong&gt; without being punctured by it's
infamous thorns, is to utilize the winding ladder of a &lt;strong&gt;Red
Mulberry&lt;/strong&gt; Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in
Hiltonia Park, where muggle activity, at times, approaches the
extreme. The cache placement is right where you should expect a
Tree ID cache to be, so be stealthy, and stay healthy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring Your Own Writing
Utensil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Red
Mulberry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morus rubra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 45-foot tall specimen of the Red
Mulberry was recorded in Franklin County in 1986. At that time, it
had a crown spread of 74 feet. The bark of this tree is dark brown,
often furrowed into thin plates, and frequently peels off in long
flakes. The Red Mulberry grows well in rich, moist soil, and
usually is found in hardwood forests of bottomlands and foothills.
Of the mulberry trees included in this program this is the only one
that is native to North America. It grows throughout most of the
eastern United States, except for the most northern parts, and
westward to Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The Red Mulberry is
widespread in Ohio, but is infrequent in the north-central part of
the state. The wood of this tree is soft but tough, and is very
durable when in contact with the soil. People use the wood in
making furniture, fence posts and tools. The berries are edible and
widely desirable, and a long line forms for them every year in the
late spring: people, livestock, many kinds of birds, various other
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Honey

Gleditsia triacanthos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not the tallest in Ohio,
this medium to large-size tree can develop a very large trunk. The
largest trunk in Ohio today (in Perry County) is a little more than
6 feet in diameter, while only 76 feet tall. The branches often but
not always have distinctive, branching thorns, not found on other
trees that are native to North America. The leathery seed pod grows
to 1 to 1.5 feet in length. This tree grows on rich, moist
bottomlands, slopes, and meadows. It is found throughout Ohio,
being especially abundant in the southwestern part of the state.
The wood is hard, strong, and durable, and is used for posts,
rails, railroad ties, and sometimes in general construction.
Honeybees feed on nectar from the inconspicuous flowers. Cattle
relish the seed pods, and the seeds are eaten by some
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;White
Oak&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quercus alba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the largest trees of
forests in the eastern United States. The tallest known in Ohio
today is an 84-foot tree in Mahoning County. The distinctive bark
is light ash-gray in color, and often fissured into scaly plates.
The tree grows best on deep, well-drained upland soils. Still, it
is found in a wide variety of habitats throughout Ohio, probably
occurring in every county. The close-grained, strong wood is one
our best for furniture and hardwood flooring. Native American
Indians made flour from its acorns. Both Indians and early settlers
boiled the acorns to make them more palatable. Many kinds of
wildlife feed on the acorns as well.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FTF Somewhere in the midst of the foggy haze of the Midwest Geobash's last day, word got around about two(count em) two Hook climbing caches being released.  Being that we'd already had two false alarms about FTFs, due to old PQs, this was sounding like an excellent stop on our journey home.  Well, morning turned to afternoon, and the chances of making it before everyone else seemed as likely as smelling sharks breath wafting through the air.  As we pull into the park, we notice the Hookmobile sitting in the parking area.  I grab my gear, and see Peanut and her master laying in the shade, enjoying life to its fullest.  As I approach, I hear another car enter the parking area.  I turn around to see the elusive silverback, no, wait, it's Alphamonkey.  Crap!  And Daige...  Better hurry, what the....  Here comes Kblast from the other direction..  I'm surrounded!  Gotta hurry...  Damn throw bag, will you just cooperate...dirty stinking #@$* ^$&amp;$#@!  Ahh, there we go.  Nobody has seen it yet, there's still a chance.  But wait, what do I see?  The Alpha's passing me....  He's in the tree, got my harness on...He's halfway up, got my gear on the rope...  He's at the top, I'm up my rope...  He's gonna spot it, I'm having difficulty...  While he's staring intently at every branch, I glance over and spot it.  Hurry, reset, traverse, drop, post, climb...I'VE GOT IT!!!!!!  Ha HA!!!  Over the cursing from above, and the cheers from below, I thanked whichever god happened to be with me that day, and signed the top slot.  I had made it before the locals(which is a feat in itself), and found it in time(which was a feat of Alpha's).  Thanks Hook for another learning experience above the earth, and thanks Alphamonkey, for making it all possible. [}:)]</groundspeak:text>

 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Sunset Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally established as Memorial Burial Park in 1922. There
are no published records of this cemetery. It is a large,
active,and growing cemetery west of Columbus. Situated on 131
acres, replete with beautiful trees, landscaping and gentle hills.
The cemetery features 25 gardens and flush to-the-ground or upright
monuments. There several war monuments throughout the grounds, and
large numbers of veterans from almost all wars of the last 100
years buried here. There are over 20 marked sections in this
cemetery, with paved roads throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunset Cemetery is located on SR-40 at 6959 West Broad Street,
Galloway, OH 43119-9391. You can access this cache by taking I-270
to the West Broad Street exit. It is approximately 3.5 miles (6
minutes) west of the freeway. The cache is in Section 14 of the
cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;b&gt;CAN NOT DO THIS CACHE AT NIGHT&lt;/b&gt; because the cemetery
is gated and monitored. Bring a pen or pencil because this cache
holds the log only. The coordinates take you to the cache location.
If you see a pole with a siren on it, and the cord dangling in the
breeze, you are close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you find the camo taped lock-n-lock letterbox at the base
of a tree nearby, it is not this cache and your log may be
deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to

&lt;strong&gt;This is a
3 stage Multi Cache that will keep you inside of Westgate
Park.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This Cache
Was placed with permission from the Columbus Department of
Recreation and Parks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please
obey the rules and regulations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What you
are looking for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 larger
micros lead to a lock and lock at stage 3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;(
muggle activity here is
extreme) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was such a fun cache to place. djstitan5,
LavaBallz, and drainhook walked around the park for several hours
looking for the most inviting of spots to place these stages. 
Each stage poses a different type of physical challenge for you,
the more intrepid geocachers to
enjoy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We Look
Forward to reading your feedback&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be
Careful when opening the stage 1 container as not to break it's
contents. Everything is tied together inside, to prevent
droppage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several great items for the ftf to
choose from. including:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coupon for 1 Free Pint of Starbuck's Ice
Cream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Groundspeak Micro Bison tube.&lt;br /&gt;
 and

PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sunset Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally established as Memorial Burial Park in 1922. There
are no published records of this cemetery. It is a large, active,
and growing cemetery west of Columbus. Situated on 131 acres,
replete with beautiful trees, landscaping and gentle hills. The
cemetery features 25 gardens and flush to-the-ground or upright
monuments. There several war monuments throughout the grounds, and
large numbers of veterans from almost all wars of the last 100
years buried here. There are over 20 marked sections in this
cemetery, with paved roads throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunset Cemetery is located on SR-40 at 6959 West Broad Street,
Galloway, OH 43119-9391. You can access this cache by taking I-270
to the West Broad Street exit. It is approximately 3.5 miles (6
minutes) west of the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a small lock-n-lock container with some small trade
items and a log. You &lt;b&gt;CAN NOT DO THIS CACHE AT NIGHT&lt;/b&gt; because
the cemetery is gated and monitored. Bring a pen or pencil, because
the pencil in the cache may go missing. The coordinates take you to
the cache location. Make sure you place the cache back in the
original location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Leaf
Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broad,
flat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;palmately
lobed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notches too
shallow to be very apparent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fruit
Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other fruit (not
cone, winged, acorn, or in pod or capsule)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tightly packed
seeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeds in capsules,
packed in non-burlike balls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dry, single seed
balls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sycamore&lt;br /&gt;
(American Sycamore)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platanus
occidentalis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not the tallest, this
probably is the largest in diameter of trees in the eastern United
States. The record holder in Ohio today has a diameter of more than
15 feet and a circumference of 48.5 feet. It probably would require
at least 8 grown persons, holding each others' hands, to reach
around this massive tree. This giant is 129 feet tall and grows in
Ashland County. In keeping with its size, Sycamores have the
largest leaves of any native tree in North America. Frequently, the
trunk of a Sycamore will be divided into several large, secondary
trunks. The bark of the Sycamore perhaps is its most striking
feature: mottled creamy white and brown with the darker bark of
older trees peeling away from the lighter-colored, younger bark.
Typically, the Sycamore grows on bottomlands, floodplains, and on
the banks of streams. It grows throughout Ohio. The tough,
coarse-grained wood is difficult to split and work. It has various
uses, including butchers' blocks. A few birds feed on the fruit,
and several mammals eat twigs and bark. The related Oriental and

London Planetrees are ornamental shade trees, frequently
planted along streets. They can be distinguished from the Sycamore
by the fruit: usually borne singly on long stalks on the Sycamore,
but in strings of 2 to 4 on the Planetrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree
Size&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
     height 80' - 100+'&lt;br /&gt;
     diameter 3' - 8'
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
Sycamore is one of my favorite Ohio Trees,  especially when
one is found leaning over a river, or a creek.  This one is a
vertical example, that stands alone in a field.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be safe, and enjoy your
climb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF Congratulations to

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cottonwood (Eastern
Cottonwood)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Populus
deltoides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest of the
North American poplar trees. Ohio's largest example, 139 feet tall
with a diameter of more than 8 feet, grows in Medina County. The
tree's large, broadly triangular leaves are from 3 to 6 inches
long, and nearly as wide. Although the Eastern Cottonwood typically
grows on the moist soils of stream bottoms, swamps and lake shores,
it can grow well on dry soil. Also, unlike most trees, it can
survive long periods partial flooding. This tree is widespread and
common in Ohio. The wood is soft, light and weak. Its use mainly is
for rough construction and wood pulp. A related tree, the Swamp
Cottonwood, is found in a few parts of Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This particular specimen that holds
the cache is but an adolescent. Unfortunately, you will not have to
climb anywhere near 100' to retrieve the cache!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to brtruitt

visit to her little playground by the creek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Peanut's Playground)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well Guess What??

&lt;p&gt;I have
another Dog…&lt;/p&gt;


His name is Dozer
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Unlike
Peanut, Dozer is a maniac, who’s limits are yet to be
discovered. He lacks grace, but boils over with playful energy. His
judgment is very poor, and he gets into things that Peanut never
would. He is absolutely, uncontrollably CRAZY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some
may even call him stupid…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;

You may have the same opinions about him (and me) if you
attempt his cache!
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain, He keeps you on your toes, and he is
a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be Prepared to Hike, Wade, Climb, Curse, and Climb some
more.&lt;/p&gt;
Just as I cannot imagine raising this goofy dog by my
lonesome, I strongly recommend bringing a partner along for this
one.
&lt;p&gt; I expect this Multi
Cache will be as much of a challenge as living with this ridiculous
dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6
larger micros lead to a slightly larger Micro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking
Coordinates are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a Dangerous cache, attempt at your own
risk&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll say this, I vomitted twice while placing the final
stage.... well not really, but almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: All I ask is that The
Person Who Signs the Log, Logs The Find. If you are a &quot;tag-along&quot;
at the bottom of the final stage, feel free to post a note, but not
a &quot;FOUND IT&quot;.  This is serious physical, and mental
challenge.  Please respect my wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please
post as many photos as you'd like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(these dogs are not fighting, they are best of
buds, having a great time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Huge HighFive, Congratulations, and small reward
to ExTheFlow For this
treacherous FTF achievement!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second To Find Honors Go to brtruitt!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third To Find Honors go to Slammer47!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[:)] Seriously though, no ambulance but we think he might have whiplash from that fall. Makes you wonder what happens when you fall from above 3 feet?   [B)]

Wow-where to start? The first stop in the tour of the area was a nice warmup.  A good chance to stretch the legs and get the blood pumping before the inevitable encroaches.  Grabbed the digits and tried one last time to talk ZhoBug06 in to ringing the bell.  No gear kept her on the ground.  Got a kick out of the car, we have a habit of finding old cars in the woods.  Of course we took the opportunity to get more pictures for our collection. I think that's the largest sycamore we saw in those woods.  On to stage three, slippery dick.  Stage four, dammit I thought I was going to get through this without getting my shoes wet.  I was wrong.  Stage five, nice climb.  This would make an excellent diving board.  Stage six, Holy Mary Mother of God.  After regaining my composure and making it above that dreaded 3 foot mark, I inched my way upward.  A third of the way through a lot of things crossed my mind.  Once I cleared all those things away, I dug from the bottom and made the grab.  The final.  For some reason looking up at this thing today, it didn't look as scary.  But I knew what I was in for. This would've been an excellent place for climbing shoes.  I decided to go against my better judgment and not tether myself.  It made for a wonderful climb.  There are a couple very nice places to rest on this ever increasing escalator of doom but when I finally made it to the top I knew it was over and I could finally cross this one off my list.  But wait, I have to get down from here... this is where equipment of the protective nature would come in handy. [:)]

Nice to meet Daige and Rope who met us about half way through. Thanks to Drainhook Dozer and Peanut for escorting us on Dozer's first trip to his cache.  Thanks for the adventurous day and thanks for the great cache!</groundspeak:text>

 THIS CACHE DOES NOT REQUIRE MOVING HEADSTONES NOR IS IT HIDDEN BY
ONE.&lt;br /&gt;
 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br /&gt;
 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clover Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest stone recorded was erected in 1824. The Prairie
Township trustees care for the cemetery but right now it is in
horrible condition. For many years the cemetery was left totally
abandoned and neglected. There are many, many broken and unreadable
stones in this cemetery. Most of the gravestones have been knocked
over to the ground and broken. Several broken gravestones are
stacked inside a fenced-in area inside the cemetery. At the main
gate is a cross which has been toppled with a plaque that
reads:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;In memory of five unknown Veterans buried in these hallowed
grounds. Let no man plow it under.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
—Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6065, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clover Cemetery is located on the west side of Alton-Darby Creek
Road, just under a mile north of Broad Street (US 40) and about a
half mile north of Alton Cemetery (GC1JA72). There is no road sign
for this cemetery and it barely seen from Alton-Darby Creek Road,.
Access is from a dirt road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a micro container with log only where you will need
to &lt;b&gt;bring your own pen or pencil&lt;/b&gt;. This is not located inside
the cemetery gates. Please do not go into the cemetery to try to
find this cache. Be aware of muggle activity with large apartment
buildings nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide the container out of sight ~~~~~~~~ Congrats to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; These caches are
hidden on a 40 acre plot of land designated as green space for
community use. This wild area is a well kept secret and is
generally only frequented by the residents of the adjacent
subdivision, Lake Darby Estates. This woodland floodplain is rich
with native natural beauty and
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, there are several residents who consider this area
to be their personal ATV course, and inflict much destruction on
the floodplain with their vehicles, and other unsavory
activities.  So please bring along a trash bag, and help us
keep this area as clean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is to bring Eco
Friendly geocachers to this area to adventure, and raise awareness
of the precarious state of our beloved watershed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Peanut and I have been
working on this multi for a couple of weeks now, and want to share
a great adventure with the more intrepid geocachers in the
area.  This course will take some time, and test your skills,
so please come down to the creek, you may even get to play with Peanut...
if you're lucky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN HUNTING THESE
CACHES.  IF YOU THINK YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT THE CACHE
BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT, COME BACK WITH HELP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!

I started out around 11:00ish at the parking coordinates, followed the path, then let my dog off his leash.   Got to stage 1, climbed up and found it fairly quickly.   Stage 2, I was a little more worried.. Temps were in the low 20's and wading might be required?  I guess I knew that, but still managed to find a way to get there without getting wet at all.  Stage 3, climbed up, almost went right past it but found it pretty quickly with a bit of luck.   Stage 4...here's where the fun begins!  I found the first part of stage 4 quickly.  Got the new coordinates, looking for stage 4.5 that should be real close.   Spent about an hour looking, climbing EVERYTHING.  After a while, I sat down, read the logs and didn't get much help...so I contacted Hook.   He told me where it should be, so I looked for another hour.   So, two hours looking for what should have been an easy find..and I still can't find it.   As I was honestly about to give up and walk my sorry butt out of there, Hook texted me to make sure everything was OK.   He said that it should be right where I had looked about twenty times and that I definitely would have found it.   He gave me directions to get to stage 5.   Stage 5:  This is where it gets really fun!   The tree was really icy, so I decided to play it safe and shimmy up.   Got all the way to the container, wrote down the coordinates and then started to make my way down again.   Got about 1/3 of the way down, and couldn't get around a branch.   Going up was tough, but not nearly as tough as going down....remember this tree was icy!   I wrapped my leg around, lost my grip a little, and went around the tree.  I was still holding on, but I was suspended over the mostly frozen creek below.  I had a great grip on the branch and could have been hanging there all day if I felt like it, but getting back topside was going to be tough.   I gave it a shot, and failed.   I lost my grip and went right into the creek....thinking &quot;PLEASE DON'T BE DEEP!&quot;   I landed in water that was up to my waist, so not a big deal.  I made my way out of the water, quickly gave Hook an &quot;SOS&quot; call for help.  I met him at the final location, he graciously had a towel and a couple of heat packs for me.

I got home and found that in the excitement, I still had the container for stage 5.....Oops!
Despite taking a polar bear plunge in 22 degree weather, this cache was AWESOME!   It'll definitely be one that I remember for a while.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, where to start.  After filling most of the free parking for the block up with cachemobiles, we get word that Peanut is already playing in a world we only know from logs and photos.  After we all get strapped in, and buckled down, we fight the urge to forge onward through the list of obstacles that we surely faced, and waited on the rest of the group.  We failed, so down the hill we went.  A new, yet somehow familiar trail to us, shared with a great group of friends, until.......   What's that up in the trees?  It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... drainhook.  Talk about &quot;overseeing&quot; your caches. [:D] Then the infamous Peanut made rounds to visit with everyone.  Peanut is truly a lovely animal, and I think it's a wonderful thing when someone rescues any animal. [^]  After some shutter clicking, we're back to the mission at hand, and onward to stage one.  After our false hopes we're dashed with a little premature congratulations to Tim, we aimed a little higher, and scored the booty.  And we're off to number two with the rest of the group, and a new excitement for what's to come.  This was a nice approach, and had everyone scrambling around the many trees and branches, while the container was located and retrieved.  I think Peanut likes this one alot.  We grabbed the next coords, and headed off for three, stopping by a natural honey factory on the way, and checked our options for the approach.  Big Will went after this one, and made quick work of snagging our next digits, while Peanut made quick work out of some roots and dirt that seemed to be impeding some serious sniffing of a certain large rodent that lived below.  After getting back on trail, we zeroed in on four, and did some &quot;birdwatching&quot; for a few minutes, before spotting the elusive creature that stood proud, almost mocking us in our efforts to complete our joyous journey.  Oh no, we will be victorious.  This was perfect, the setting, the hide, the effort, and the consequences.  It also made for the perfect photo op, which Duane graciously provided, via mid-stream camera placement.  Once we emptied the tree, we take off for the last stage, which couldn't have been a better ending to a well planned, and exciting multicache.  We chatted at GZ for awhile, before heading off to Easton to stir up security.  Signed the log TNLN  Thanks again for tagging along, and for placing a very cool cache for us to find.  We WILL be back. [}:)]</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hook, I cannot thank you ENOUGH for taking time out of your morning before the WWFM VI event to come and put those waders on to take some amazing pictures for us.  It was so good to finally meet you, Peanut, and share our Darby stories.  No doubt we will be seeing each other out there again soon.

It was such a perfect day to try the often talked about, scary but well revered Peanut's Playground.  The weather could not have been better, and the water was low.  Funny how we have fished on these islands over the years and never thought something could someday be looming overhead [:D]  We got to do some quality creekstompin with some really good friends.  TeamGuisinger, Bartholic and ourselves of the original &quot;Clever Cachers&quot; group. Chaseur, Timeage, and Lil Viv and all the kids of each cacher group. It was quite a gang down there today.

Stage 1 and stage 2 were knocked out fairly quickly.  Stage 3 gets a little harder, but when you have a 9 year old with rubber boots on that climbs like a professional, you can't go wrong!!  AWESOME JOB!

JB creekstomper actually tried stage 4, but after breaking a branch off decided that if he were to go any higher, he might break more limbs and compromise the cache for future attempts.  So he came down and Mr. TeamG Josh made it look so easy. 

Stage 5 was the final reward, and a very nice one.  Well stocked and what a fine view you have here!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have had 4 months to the day to think about the last visit. After getting with a few feet of stage 4 I was GOING to make it up the tree this time. Out today with TeamBobcats, Kihap, TeamMonroes, Escondidas, and Trybble1 and Miketr90. I had the luxury of watching the other grab the first 3 stages and keep myself from thinking about the inevitable climb at stage 4.The 2 venti cups of Starbucks had me kinda wired so I was hoping I could just jump to the limb containing the cache. After a few others made the climb I finally had to go. It wasnt as bad as I remember and was able to make the touch on stage 4!!! WAHOOO. 

Escondidas made the trip up the same way I went up the last visit. Congrats to him for getting farther than I did. 

Thanks to Drainhook and Peanut for this great cache. It has been many many years since I have climbed trees and well I hope it is many more before the next time. ;)

This is a fairly simple cache at one of the downtown parks in
Columbus which opened in the Spring of 2005. North Bank park is
situated on the north bank of the Scioto River south of Spring
Street at the intersection of Neil Avenue. There is meter parking
available on Spring Street. Posted hours are 7:00am until 11:00 pm,
although this one would be a great night cache if you are there
before closing time.

&lt;b&gt;Please be sure to re-hide EXACLTY where you find! There is a
place that will protect it from the rain and a place that will keep
it exposed.&lt;/b&gt; The location aids in its ability to withstand the
elements. 
&lt;p&gt;Kids should love this park since there are jumping fountains for
them to run through. There are also many tables, so bring a lunch
and enjoy some of the spectacular views of the downtown
skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a log sheet inside, but there is no room for trade
items. There is no room for a writing utensil so please make sure
you bring one to log your visit.&lt;/p&gt;

I went up first, but somehow missed the cache.. We each went up, came down, then headed for our next climb.  On the way, blandestk suggested that we tackle all of the 5-star terrains today because we made such quick work out of this one....little did he know....

Bait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ftf
Honors to brtruitt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people like to play tennis, golf, or
even scuba dive.  Most of you know by now that I love to climb
trees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Well, when I am Not Climbing Trees, I
love to fish moving water.  There is nothing like twitching a
bait on the surface of a river, with the intent of tricking a
Smallmouth Bass into Taking The Bait.  These fish are
voracious fighters, that literally Fly out of the water during the
heat of battle.  These photos of flying fish were taken by my
lovely wife while I was in mid fight with my favorite species of
fish. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This transitional time of year,
when the water gets cooler, bordering on cold, is my favorite time
to fish with Live Bait. The Smallmouth huddle together in the
deepest pools they can find, vying for prime positions to ambush
unsuspecting schools of
baitfish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The first step in this
p&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rocess is to catch some
bait.  I like to catch bait in the same stream that I will be
fishing as to present the most natural bait possible (what the
smallmouth are already accustomed to hunting).  I utilize a
cast-net, to catch as many of these nice plump Shiners, or Northern
Stonerollers as possible, as&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ese are some of the
Smallmouth's favorite treats.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In the warmer months, Peanut
and I like to wade the streams, pitching artificial baits, and
lures, stalking feeding smallmouth for hours at a time. I also take
great pleasure in hunting BIG catfish during the summer
months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This stretch of creek that you will be
experiencing is a great place to catch some lively Smallmouth
Bass.  Along with your fishing gear, please bring a trash bag
and help me clean up after some not so conscientious fisherpeople
who frequent the area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh yeah, about the
cache - The hint is for one of the middle stages, maybe stage 4, or
5, I forget.  The terrain throughout this adventure can be
very tricky at times. Pay attention to recent rainfall, and water
levels, to know what you may be getting into, rather, HOW MUCH you
will be getting into.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Practice Catch &amp;
Release!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Look for the poison ivy and you will find it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, 2010, I've already gotten poison ivy two times so I thought I should do some research. Please check the link included for pictures throughout the season of the changes in the leaves of poison ivy. &lt;br/&gt;You can almost count on poison ivy growing at the edge of every field within its range. And at the edge of every road, and the edge of every forest. And wherever man has bulldozed a stable environment - like a new shopping mall or a housing subdivision. In the open field the grass usually wins over time, and in the deep woods the ivy probably can't get enough light. But at the edge of the field, forest, parking lot, or road - the poison ivy wins out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

spots on the Big Darby creek. You can pull safely off the road from
either direction, but of course be careful getting back on the main
road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access this cache from 70E or 70W - just follow the map
and take High Free Pike / Roberts Road, the first road just south
of the interstate ramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please put the cache back in the exact spot to avoid it being
smuggled by muggles. This is a good C.I.T.O opportunity as
well!&lt;/p&gt;

I saw this one publish during the middle of my work day. When I read the name I was immediately interested, as I consider Big Darby to be &quot;My Stream&quot;. I spend a lot of time on this creek, and cherish the solitude, and adventure it offers me.

I then looked at the cache page, during my break, and saw that this was at one of my most frequented paddle put-ins (and Very near where I have been planning on placing a cache!) So I had to stop after work, and check this one out. It was right where I thought it would be. This was the first cache that I found using only my iphone.

Thanks for the cache.

What is a haiku?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The
haiku originated in Japan and is a verse (poem) written in three
lines. The haiku does not have to rhyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The entire haiku is composed in 17 syllables. The first line
contains five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and
the third and final line has five syllables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5
    
did you bring a pen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
7   

no, I left it in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5  
     

CRAP! I’ll go get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The haiku posted doesn’t have to conform to the traditional
haiku subject matter i.e. nature, or the changing of seasons.
Simply write one about anything as long as it keeps the 5 - 7
– 5 syllable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I encourage you to have fun, even post a photo, and add a haiku
accompaniment such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets embrace once more&lt;br /&gt;
Before Autumn's frigid breath&lt;br /&gt;
Sends us to our death.&lt;/strong&gt; 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;first peeled off my
rind&lt;br /&gt;
now he stares at my behind&lt;br /&gt;
lest he would go blind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to brtruitt for the
FTF!  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Photos and
haiku not required, just encouraged&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jonathan Alder History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Alder&lt;br /&gt;
First White Settler in Madison County (1773 -1849)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven-year-old Jonathan Alder was captured by a Native American
war party in Virginia in 1781 and taken to a Mingo village north of
the Mad River in Ohio where he was adopted by an Indian family. He
remained with the Indians until after the 1795 Treaty of Greenville
ended the Indian Wars in the Ohio Country. As white settlers
entered the region, Alder frequently served as an interpreter. In
1805, he journeyed to Virginia and was reunited with his original
family. He returned to Ohio with his new wife, Mary Blont, and
built a cabin on Big Darby Creek. His cabin is now at the Madison
County Historical Society Museum in London. Alder is buried in
Foster Chapel Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable historical graves from the mid-1800's timeframe
buried in this cemetery include the Beach, Bidwell and Harbage
families. Many stones date back to the mid to late 1800's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cemetery is located 1.1 miles north of Interstate 70. If
coming from the highway, you would exit at #85, West
Jefferson/Plain City going north. There is both re-entry to 70E/70W
from this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This traditional cache is placed in the Foster Chapel Cemetery.
Foster Chapel Cemetery is also known as Alder Chapel or the
Methodist Episcopal Cemetery. Please respect all cemetery rules
posted at the entrance of the driveway. Cemetery closes at dark,
and we absolutely do not recommend trying to find this one in the
dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container lid must be placed on correctly and screwed on well.
Please make sure it is sealed properly. Travel bugs and trackable
items are always welcome at this location! The container is large
enough to hold several large items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Original Contents included:&lt;br /&gt;
WV Totem Pole TB&lt;br /&gt;
The General Lee TB&lt;br /&gt;
Daisy's Jeep TB&lt;br /&gt;
among many other goodie geoswag items&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The coordinates take you to a
little clearing surrounded by trees, and the remnants of a
farmhouse. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;At
Ground Zero you will find a Mason Jar that was already present when
I placed the cache.  There are strange items in the
jar. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These items are of no
consequence, just a marker so you know that you are at the
right spot. &lt;br /&gt;
 Please leave this container where you found it, (it is NOT THE
CACHE) but feel free to place any other interesting items found at
the site, in the container - No Swag.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- OK -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Stand next to this container and
look around. You will see 3 TREES, that are solid
options for a terrain challenge.  If you walk around
and look hard enough you will even see containers peering down at
you from each of these trees.  One of these trees holds the
the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which one contains the
log?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 None of these containers are &quot;easy&quot; to get to, but some are much
harder than their
counterparts.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will
you get lucky?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please
share in your logging how many

licks it takes for you to get to the center of this
cache.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Did you get lucky and choose the correct way first? Did you pick
the one that you thought was the easiest to get to, then realize it
was not the right one (Or vice versa)?  Did you Stand by the
jar, look around, and drive home with your tail between your legs,
and your finger on the ignore
button? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No spoilers in
the logging please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There
      will be a nice reward for the first to find, after the log is
      verified.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; OH Yeah, -
Bring &lt;strong&gt;a Pen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since I had already seen the view from all angles, I needed a little schoolin' to point me in the right direction.  How did I know that the direction would be up?  Call it a hunch.  I wondered as I clung there admiring the view abroad, &quot;How many of the endless cars going by, in the middle of whatever has them driving that road, at that time, has the consciousness about them to notice, the crazy wierdo swaying in the top of the trees in the middle of nowhere?&quot;  That being said, it was another caching experience that I will never forget(repetition will do that to ya) [B)] and you've convinced me that I'm not the only twisted cacher around anymore.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ohio state has been a football Institution for some time now. Many great games played here at the Shoe. Im a proud buckeye, and have taken part in the best tradition. Any buckeye knows that means beating Michigan. So with that being said I knew that a cache need to be set up for all buckeyes to share in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We recently Lost a legendary coach ( May 30, 2011). He won 7 big ten titles. 1 national championship and best of all, boasts a record of 9 wins 1 loss vs Michigan. The best record in OSU history. Truly a worthy coach. Name that coach. </groundspeak:long_description>

I checked online before heading home... Great! a cache only a couple miles away... You know the rest...

This one took me a while longer than it should have though. Bouncing signals had me all over the place and when I finally had a steadier gz, it didn't make sense. I was about to give up and head home (I was tired) when I spotted it right where I had decided it couldn't be. As I was signing the log I heard something rattle and found there was a TB in there... cool!

Not sure about the location on this one... I don't think it will last long.

T: TB to move along &amp; SL

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat awhile on the
metal bench, allowing my thoughts to drift. Floating Notions
flurried through my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
These
waking dreams have focused intent, of weaving through the
stars.
&lt;p&gt;Mere
inches or feet of subtle ascent, unnoticed by passing
cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaxing
the laws of physics to bend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With
fear and trembling, end over end,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spin
wildy collapsing,  back to the bench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
taste of transcendence, a thirst I must quench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus...
Envision... Weightless... Adrift...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
shackles of gravity, Their hold starts to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further
now, I'm letting go, evading trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body,
and mind in flux, I've crossed the crux...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverting Constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

You must sign the real log that *I* hid (you'll know). Don't sign a log you put out because it's easier. Don't claim a find without signing the log. Any online logs claiming a find where a fake log was signed will be deleted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please no spoilers!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
is the largest of the Ash trees in North America, sometimes
reaching 100 feet in height. The tallest specimen in Ohio today
reaches 85 feet, and almost is 6 feet in diameter. The firm, gray
bark of the White Ash has diamond-shaped furrows and interlacing
ridges. The tree grows in the rich, moist, well-drained soil of
bottomlands and not-so-dry slopes. It ranges throughout Ohio. The
size and value of White Ash trees make this one of the primary
commercial hardwoods in the United States. The wood is hard,
strong, elastic, and very useful. It has a variety of applications,
including interior finish, vehicles, furniture, containers, and
wooden equipment. Also, it often has been used as a shade or street
tree. Several kinds of birds eat the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

We had to put out a light pole cache, but this one is a little less
traditional.&lt;br /&gt;
Traffic is pretty heavy, so use your vehicle to block the
view.&lt;br /&gt;
Lots of kids hang out or cut through this area.&lt;br /&gt;
Stealth is required.&lt;br /&gt;
Bring a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;

Along the way I remembered when I was here before there was a van parked right in front of the area I wanted to search with workers passing the time sitting inside the van on lunch break. This time, after dark, it was much easier to search. I'm going to have to do more of this night caching in order to find some caches. This was a great hide. Not what I was expecting at all.

 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br /&gt;
 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wesley Chapel Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesley Chapel Cemetery was established in 1818, although the
first burial did not take place until 1835. It is still an active
cemetery. It is located beside the FORMER Wesley Chapel Methodist
Church. Please note that this is now a private residence, and no
longer a church. The oldest gravestones are located near the former
church. It is a beautiful, very well maintained cemetery with
several interesting, old gravestones with detailed carvings.

&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesley Chapel Cemetery is located on Dublin Road, about one mile
south of Fishinger Road, in Hilliard, Ohio (Norwich Township,
Franklin County). Cache is best accessed from the road within the
cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
The cache is a small lock-n-lock with room for very small trading
items. You may need to &lt;b&gt;bring your own pen or pencil&lt;/b&gt;. Please
respect all cemetery rules posted at the entrance of the driveway.
Cemetery is open Dawn to Dusk, and we absolutely do not recommend
trying to find this one after dark due to the housing developments
which border the cemetery and people who will see you in the
dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide the container out of sight ~~~~~~~~ Congrats to

We left just before it started raining so we must have missed the other cacher by minutes. 
Very nice cemetery hidden away back there.

You can also park along Dodridge in an entrance area but the gate is never open on this side of the cemetery. It is actually easier to find if you park on Dodridge at this entrance. Dodrige is closed for repairs to the bridge but you can enter Dodridge from Olentangy River Rd. Container is a small plastic gum containter. Good luck.  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the third cache in a series called &lt;b&gt;&quot;PAF&quot; -- or Phone
A Friend&lt;/b&gt; series. You will be tempted to phone a friend, but
sometimes that may just be for moral support when you find our
cache is not as easy as you think. Or it may be that you will need
to phone a friend because you tried to get some information from
them, but now it isn't working out for you. So there's plenty of
reasons to phone a friend. But we're afraid this won't help you
this time no matter how hard you try, or at least that's &lt;b&gt;our
goal!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far the series:&lt;br /&gt;
PAF #1 - Succession&lt;br /&gt;
PAF #2 - C&amp;O A800&lt;br /&gt;
PAF #3 - Surreptitious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a cache in Cross Creek Park. There is no need
to go near school property, and parking coordinates have been
provided so you may park along the road. Please abide by all rules
and regulations in posted signage for this common use field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can use the sidewalk and walk .10 mi to the cache site from the
parking coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
N 40° 01.202&lt;br /&gt;
W 83° 09.569&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coordinates take you to the area you need to search. Muggles may be
present - driving by - or just in the area. Stealth is required.
Cache In Trash Out (CITO) efforts are appreciated here!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring a pen. Re-hide the cache as it was found. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2QEQ0 - GC2QEQ0 Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 01.202 W 083° 09.569 </groundspeak:long_description>

This picturesque little park deserved a cache, so I hid one in a
place that'll take you all the way through the park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suggest parking on Indianola Ave, especially if you're going for
the FTF. There's parking near Cliffside and Indianola, except 7am -
9am on weekdays. You may also be able to park at the end of Glen
Echo Dr, south of Arcadia, where it ends at the park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stage one is a small camo'd pill container. Stage two is a slightly
larger pill container. Your feet (and maybe a little more) are
probably going to get wet, this is a nice cache for a hot
summer day! As always, please re-hide the cache as you found it.
You must sign the log book to get the smiley...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: This cache is very susceptible to mother nature. It's
vitally important that you rehide both stages as I have them. Due
to some severe storms immediately after having the cache published,
Stage 2 came up missing and Stage 1 was close to sharing the same
fate. This is nobody's fault except my own, I underestimated
nature. When you find this cache, PLEASE learn from my mistake and
do your best to make sure it'll stay put! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to JNLE4 and KBLAST for the co-FTF!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Populus alba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;White Poplar&lt;/strong&gt;) is a species of poplar, most closely related to the aspens
(&lt;em&gt;Populus&lt;/em&gt; sect. &lt;em&gt;Populus&lt;/em&gt;). It is native from
Spain and Morocco
through central Europe (north to Germany
and Poland) to central Asia. It grows
in moist sites, often by watersides, in regions with hot summers
and cold to mild winters.[1][2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
White Poplar leaves; underside left, upper side right


&lt;br /&gt;
White Poplar trunk, showing the characteristic
diamond-shaped marks

&lt;p&gt;It is a medium-sized deciduous tree, growing
to heights of up to 16-27 m (rarely more), with a trunk up to 1 m
diameter and a broad rounded crown. The bark is smooth
and greenish-white to greyish-white with characteristic
diamond-shaped dark marks on young trees, becoming blackish and
fissured at the base of old trees. The young shoots are covered
with whitish-grey down, including the small buds. The leaves are
4-15 cm long, five-lobed, with a thick covering of white
scurfy down on both sides but thicker underneath; this layer wears
off the upper side but not the lower, which stays white until
autumn leaf fall. Larger, deeply lobed leaves are produced on
fast-growing young trees, and smaller, less deeply lobed leaves on
older, slow-growing trees. The flowers
are catkins up to 8 cm long, produced in early
spring; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on
separate trees; the male catkins are grey with conspicuous dark red
stamens, the female catkins are greyish-green. The female catkins
lengthen to 8–10 cm after pollination, with several
green seed capsules, maturing in late spring to early summer. It
also propagates by means of root
suckers growing from the lateral roots, often as far as 20-30 m
from the trunk, to form extensive clonal colonies.[2][3]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;White Poplar hybridises with the closely related
Common Aspen &lt;em&gt;Populus tremula&lt;/em&gt;; the resulting hybrid, known as &lt;strong&gt;Grey
Poplar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Populus × canescens&lt;/em&gt;), is intermediate
between its parents, with a thin grey downy coating on the leaves,
which are also much less deeply lobed than White Poplar leaves. It
is a very vigorous tree with marked hybrid
vigour, reaching 40 m tall and over 1.5 m trunk diameter (much
larger than either of its parents). Most Grey Poplars in
cultivation are male, but female clones are occasionally
found.[2]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Cultivation and uses&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It requires abundant light and ample moisture,
and stands up well to flood water and slightly acidic soils. Its
green-and-white leaves makes it an effective ornamental tree but the
root suckers may cause problems in some situations. It is very
attractive as an open-grown tree in water meadows, and, because of
its extensive root system and tolerance of salt, is also planted to
strengthen coastal sand dunes.[4]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The majority of White Poplars in cultivation in
northern Europe are female trees.[3]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;White poplar was first introduced to North
America in 1748 and has a long history in cultivation.[1] It is now found in
forty-three states throughout the contiguous U.S.[2] It has come to be
considered weedy or invasive, and has been banned in
Connecticut.[3][4] US invasive state location
map&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It has been introduced into North America,
especially along the east coast. It is a highly competitive tree
and was the most common introduced tree species on Cape Breton Island.[5]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In intensive forest management it is being
replaced by various cottonwood hybrids. The wood is soft, and used to make
cellulose and for cheap boxes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A conical cultivar from Turkestan, &lt;em&gt;Populus alba&lt;/em&gt; 'Pyramidalis'
(Bolle's Poplar; syn. &lt;em&gt;Populus bolleana&lt;/em&gt;) is sometimes
planted in parks.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WADE THROUGH THE FIRST TUNNEL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The published coordinates take you to two tunnels extending from the river. You will have to walk through about an inch of water to get in, or you can swing down and enter that way. You will enter one of the two tunnels and proceed through it. The terrain and difficulty ratings will climb as you continue on your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a highly dangerous cache. You will be climbing. You will be crawling. You will get wet. You will probably get muddy. If you are a bigger person, you probably won't have much luck with this cache. Know your own limits and don't do anything you aren't comfortable with. You will remain underground the whole time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE AS OF 6/22/11: There is now a lock on the final container. You will get the combination at the second to last stage. The reason for this can be found in the logs below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THINGS YOU NEED:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A friend (You do NEED to bring a friend unless you are tall enough and have an insane amount of upper body strength. It is not just recommended. At one point the correct path is practically impossible-- but apparently not impossible-- to access without a friend to give you a boost. You'll want someone who can support your weight and who you can support the weight of because BOTH of your names need to be on the log book if you are both going to log it online.)&lt;br/&gt;A flashlight (you will need to see)&lt;br/&gt;THINGS YOU ARE HIGHLY ADVISED TO BRING ALONG:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tweezers&lt;br/&gt;Kneepads&lt;br/&gt;Elbowpads&lt;br/&gt;Waterproof boots</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>At one point you'll be asked to look for some white graffiti we found on the wall of the tunnel. This will become apparent.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A couple more things:
First, I think there's a chance that wading will be required in the first tunnel, or at least part of it for a good portion of the year.   That wading shouldn't deter anyone going for this cache.

Second, this is DEFINITELY a five star cache.  No doubt about it.  They told me &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; should be a four, and this is by far more insane than that.

Finally.....yes....I am completely and totally crazy.   Anyone going for this should use their own judgement, not mine.  If you want to see if you can do this cache, try mine first:  GC2H82Y     If you can't do that, you can't do this.</groundspeak:text>

Ok, the whole story:   This cache came out this morning and I was super excited to have another tunnel cache, especially one rated this hard.  It sounded SUPER cool and I was TOTALLY pumped all day at work, even though I knew what the weather would be like.   Anyway, as it approached quitting time, I made the decision:  &quot;I'M GOING FOR IT!!!!!&quot;   So I rushed home, took the dog for a walk, change into my worst clothes and headed out.   I got to GZ and there was someone standing right there but it was a teenage girl and probably her mom, it looked like they were taking pictures.   I barged right on past, into the tunnel of my choosing...not sure if I was choosing correctly.   The water was a little deeper than an inch, but it was totally fine...I really don't mind getting wet.   I got to the first container, found it pretty easily and discovered that my choice was 'ok'.   Follow the directions to find the next...and honestly, here's where I was most afraid.  That climb was the scariest part of the cache for me...it wasn't very high, but being afraid of heights it doesn't have to be.
After the climb, I followed the directions...then made my choice.  I chose wrong...of course.   I KNEW I was choosing wrong, but thought I'd take the chance.   Once I went the correct way, I was a little worried...can I make this turn?  Yes....but just barely.  My legs were a little long.   Then I got worried....TWO containers?   THANKFULLY it was ok and I once again followed the directions.
When I got to the final area, I saw why you need a friend.  Let me just say this....If you're tall enough, you CAN do it with an INSANE amount of upper body strength.

COMPLETELY SOAKING WET, undershirt ruined, hole worn into my jacket and COMPLETELY SATISFIED!   FTF, BY MYSELF! 

Definitely a favorite, definitely worthy of five stars.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those of you who grew up in Hilliard, or can remember back
to when there were no railroad bridges on Hilliard-Cemetery Road.
You will remember when these pine trees were planted during the
expansion of the road and the construction of the railroad bridge
which helped &quot;decongest&quot; the area. It's hard to believe today that
you had to wait at the tracks .... and not drive underneath
them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pines at the top of the embankment on each side of the road
are now standing tall, full grown and welcoming you into the city
from the freeway. This &quot;odd&quot; pine stands on the old Sutherland's
Lumberyard / current Life Community church side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to access this from the Life Community Church parking
lot. You CANNOT access this from Hilliard-Cemetery Road. Please
bring your own writing utensil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; From the

&lt;strong&gt;Silver Maple&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Acer saccharinum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeply lobed leaves
are silvery on their under surfaces, a feature often noticeable
when leaves are blown by wind. The bark of older trees typically
separates into long, narrow scales, giving the trunks a &quot;shaggy&quot;
appearance. The tree commonly grows in moist and fertile habitats,
in swamps, stream banks, and bottomlands where flooding occurs. As
with the Red
Maple, Silver Maple wood is soft and neither strong nor
durable. Its uses generally are limited to cheap furniture,
pulpwood, containers, and as a fuel. Although relatively
short-lived, this fast-growing tree commonly is planted along
community streets and as a shade tree. An early writer claimed that
&quot;more tasty&quot; sugar could be gotten from this tree and the Red
Maple than from the 
Sugar Maple, but in much lower quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second in a series called &lt;b&gt;&quot;PAF&quot; -- or Phone A
Friend&lt;/b&gt; series. You will be tempted to phone a friend, but
sometimes that may just be for moral support when you find our
cache is not as easy as you think. Or it may be that you will need
to phone a friend because you tried to get some information from
them, but now it isn't working out for you. So there's plenty of
reasons to phone a friend. But we're afraid this won't help you
this time no matter how hard you try, or at least that's &lt;b&gt;our
goal!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far the series:&lt;br /&gt;
PAF #1 - Succession&lt;br /&gt;
PAF #2 - C&amp;O A800&lt;br /&gt;
PAF #3 - Surreptitious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some History:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1929-30, wooden cabooses were common on American railroads,
as were wooden box cars and composite gondolas and hoppers, but
steel was quickly supplanting wooden cars everywhere. When both the
C&amp;O and Pere Marquette got new cabooses in 1937, they were
steel cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM A800-A824 were built by Magor Car Corporation and were
delivered in June 1930. They had rectangular marker lights mounted
permanently on the cupola sides in an unusual configuration.
Otherwise, by all measures both inside and out they were standard.
They weighed about 44,000 pounds, as compared with 41,500 for the
C&amp;O cars built at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the PM was merged into the C&amp;O in 1947, the cars were
relettered. They retained their original numbers until they were
retired sometime in the mid-1970s, when all wooden C&amp;O cabooses
were taken out of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Note: The coordinates take you to the caboose, from there you
are on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Many More Times, treat me the way you wanna do?&lt;br /&gt;
When I give you all my love, please, please be true.&lt;br /&gt;
I'll give you all I've got to give, GPS, PAF, and all.&lt;br /&gt;
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna
crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to touch/search any wood or wood objects on the
caboose. The cache is attractive for sure. When you find it -
&lt;b&gt;please put it BACK EXACTLY HOW YOU FOUND IT!&lt;/b&gt; You don't want
to give the next cacher a 5 difficulty now do you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please use extreme stealth because there are police and firemen
nearby (substation). Acting may be required!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We do NOT recommend doing this one at night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Muggles could be everywhere and access could be restricted at
times. Please find a place to park and walk to the cache. Avoid
blocking the road in front of the caboose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we see any damage done to this caboose, we will pull the listing
and archive it. Please be respectful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great place to bring your picnic lunch or dinner, your
family, your dog or just spend some time. Lots of historical things
to look at and usually a quiet place. Lots of mature trees for
shade!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache will bring you to trees, tunnels, and through the creek that I always loved to explore when I was younger. This cache will either require wading or some bush-whacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this is a dangerous cache that requires tree climbing. This cache will only require a little bit of rope. I was fine using the rope that I have (I think it's 17 feet). You may be able to complete this without any gear but I highly advise that you don't. Some stages can easily be completed without gear, although again, I highly advise that you use gear. Some climbs are very difficult, especially for an inexperienced climber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also recommend bringing two pairs of shoes; one for wading and one for climbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me know when you're going and I would love to tag along. Just send an email to dkington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, practice CITO. This area needs it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and have fun! Let me know if you think the ratings are too high or too low.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found this with a great group, I'm glad to have been able to tag along!   

I got a text from TMH right after I got off work, letting me know that they were going for it.   I was already in another park with my dog, planning to go play in the water and just generally wear him out.   I wasn't really equipped for this cache, but I decided to go anyway.

When I got to GZ at stage 3, I texted to say that I was there.   The container was pointed out to me.   I climbed up the tree pretty high yesterday, without gear, and was apparently going in the right direction... since the group already had coordinates, that was good enough for me.  (especially since I was wearing shorts today and would have destroyed my legs getting up there again.)

Stage 4 was super easy to spot.  At stage 5, KBLAST already had his roped in the tree.   As he was preparing, I went another way and made it into the tree.   I got high enough that I required some kind of fall protection, so I came back down and put on TMH's harness.   When I was ready to go back up, KBLAST was already doing a very impressive rope climb.   I waited for him to get up to a safe level, then climbed up behind him.    This was my first climb with any kind of equipment.....  Honestly, I had a hard time with it.  At one point I really wanted to take off the harness and climb the rest of the way without it.   I know it's for safety, but the ropes really got in my way.   I've decided that I'm going to buy my own gear so that I can use shorter ropes and get more used to having them.

Blandestk and TMH went for stage 6 while we were getting out of the tree. They came back within a few minutes with the next coordinates.

At the final, TMH said that it looks like a &quot;Dos-Boot climb&quot;.   I went to check out that tree while everyone was still deciding on if it was the right one or not.   I got a few feet up and didn't see any signs of climbing, so I didn't go any higher.   Next I went up the correct tree, and at the top spotted the container.   I got up there, got the container, had the pen in my pocket....but just couldn't sign....   I lost control of my fear and had to get down.   I dropped the container to the team below, they signed names, and theLadyBee returned it.

TFTC, it was fun!   I'm glad that I went with a good tree climbing team.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Like the group before me, I found stage one and two easily enough.  I felt a little uneasy getting stage one, because some lady came out to sit in her yard down below.  I'm unsure if she saw me, or cared, but I felt like I was in a position to have my actions misunderstood.  At two, I realized that I didn't have my flashlight in my bag, so I used my phone and made the find.

Stage three is where I'm assuming the climbing gear starts to come into play.  I searched low for a while, then went up and searched the high.  Getting into that tree, without rope or gear, wasn't so bad....     

Ok....no...that's a lie.  Getting up in that tree without rope or gear was brutal.  I guess I can thank my insane upper body strength!  (Hi, KBLAST! I said that just for you.)  Both arms have huge bruises under my shoulders, both legs have scrapes and cuts up to the knee.   My recent &quot;Lttldude scar&quot; from Urban Experience 7 got opened back up for like the fifth time...it'll probably not get a chance to heal until winter.  
Anyway, once up in that tree, I climbed up a bit and noticed what looked like climbing bread crumbs.  I texted MidwestHaunters and he had the same thoughts.  I had a few young onlookers at this point, curious to find out what the crazy man was doing.  I told them that I was looking for something, so they started looking around too.   I decided that they probably weren't reliable company for calling 911....and my dog was yelling at me to walk him some more...so I called off the search.

If anyone wants to go for a team effort, I'd like to try to join along.</groundspeak:text>

Hilliard Business Complex. Follow the road to the end of the court
and park there. Enter the wooded area to your right across from the
old Fed Ex Shipping Terminal. The most direct looking path is not
the easiest. Take the obvious paths into this dense area, and your
GPS may bounce a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is fair amount trash, so bring a garbage bag (perfect
C.I.T.O opportunity). You will see the remains of the old farm
house and the silo which still stands tall in amazing shape. You
are looking for a medium sized camo'd lock-n-lock capable of
holding trade items and moderate sized trackables. Please bring
your own writing utensil.&lt;/p&gt;

HIDDEN BY ONE.&lt;br /&gt;
 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br /&gt;
 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Big Darby Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Darby Cemetery is still an active cemetery. It is also known
as Big Darby Baptist Cemetery, and it's located behind the Baptist
Church. It's in fantastic shape, the grounds are very well taken
care of. There's also a very beautiful view of the surrounding
farms from the back of the cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Darby Cemetery is located on the east side of Plain
City-Georgesville Road, just north of Price-Hilliards Road, outside
Plain City, Ohio (Canaan Township, Madison County). You can access
this cache from I-70 E or W by going NORTH on SR 142 (Plain
City-Georgesville Road) approximately 4.5 miles. If coming from the
highway, you would exit at #85, West Jefferson/Plain City going
north. You will pass the Alder TB Hotel (GC1JWD6) on the way to
this cache from the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT in the landscape island where you park.
Please do not disturb any landscaping.&lt;/b&gt; Cache is a small
lock-n-lock container with some small trade items and a log. We do
not recommend doing this cache at night, and the cemetery hours do
not support night caching. Bring a pen or pencil, because the
pencil in the cache may go missing. The coordinates take you to the
cache location. Make sure you place the cache back in original
condition - so that everything looks &quot;normal&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to

Environmental water quality, also called ambient water quality,
relates to water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. Water
quality standards vary significantly due to different environmental
conditions, ecosystems, and intended human uses. Toxic substances
and high populations of certain microorganisms can present a health
hazard for non-drinking purposes such as irrigation, swimming,
fishing, rafting, boating, and industrial uses. These conditions
may also affect wildlife which use the water for drinking or as a
habitat. Modern water quality laws general specify protection of
fisheries and recreational use and require as a minimum,retention
of current quality standards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is some desire among the public to return water bodies to
pristine, or pre-industrial conditions. Most current environmental
laws focus of the designation of uses. In some countries these
allow for some water contamination as long as the particular type
of contamination is not harmful to the designated uses. Given the
landscape changes in the watersheds of many freshwater bodies,
returning to pristine conditions would be a significant challenge.
In these cases, environmental scientists focus on achieving goals
for maintaining healthy eco-systems and may concentrate of the
protection of populations of endangered species and protecting
human health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a log only micro, be sure to bring your own pen. You
may want some tweezers to remove the log, but I'm hoping you don't
need it (I have a bent paperclip to help put the log in and out of
the container). You shouldn't need to use much stealth when signing
the log as you should be well concealed. Muggles hopefully won't
give the cache much attention but it should DEFINITELY be something
a geocacher will recognize as the cache...really, I can't label it
any more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain is a little muddy and does have a steep slope next to
the cache, but it shouldn't be an issue as there is solid footing
right to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

Studman96 and I both ensured that this cache can be done without the utilization of that gear and so the four and a half star terrain rating is accurate. But please be as safe as possible while going after that find. Additionally, if you find that you cannot complete the climbs without the utilization of gear and you are forced to 'submit' there is no shame in that, if that is the only way you see yourself making the find. One again, exercise caution on this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

Studman, it was especially cool having you along to help us out and give your expert climbing advice on most of these stages!

Thanks to Studman for pushing my limits and telling me to keep going when I didn't want to.  There was one place where I really didn't want to go any further, but I knew that I'd be letting you (Studman) down if I didn't ring the bell.


I don't want to spoil the cache for anyone, but let's just say that Studman did a great job hiding each stage.  I can't wait for your next hide, Studman!  I'm sure it'll be as good as all of the other Studman caches I've done!

&lt;br /&gt;
It's not that easy being green&lt;br /&gt;
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves&lt;br /&gt;
When I think it could be nicer being red, or yellow or gold&lt;br /&gt;
Or something much more colorful like that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's not easy being green&lt;br /&gt;
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things&lt;br /&gt;
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're&lt;br /&gt;
Not standing out like flashy sparkles in the water&lt;br /&gt;
Or stars in the sky&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located off of the Olentangy trail. I rated the
terrain a &quot;3&quot; because it can be very muddy and slippery, especially
after any rain. If you're bringing children with you, keep them
safe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking can be found in one of the public parks, either Whetstone
or Antrim. Please do not park at the nearby school.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're probably going to need tweezers or something to pull the log
out. It's a log-only micro. Make sure you bring your own pen!
Please re-hide the cache exactly as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swamp chestnut oak, also called basket or cow oak, is a handsome member of the white oak group known for its large, fuzzy, coarsely toothed leaves and big acorns, some of the largest in the Oak family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White-tailed deer, turkey, squirrels, and hogs eat the acorns. Cows eat the acorns , as the common name 'cow oak' suggests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many oaks, swamp chestnut makes a good shade tree with its broad, spreading branches and large foliage.	 	&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twigs and leaves&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The light brown wood is hard, strong, and durable and is used for flooring, veneer, furniture, farming tools, posts, and barrels. It is has also been used to make baskets which is where another of its common names comes from. The quality of the wood is similar to white oak but swamp chestnut oak is not as widespread or abundant as white oak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swamp chestnut oaks are found from New Jersey to Florida and throughout the Mississippi River Valley, Illinois, and Ohio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Identifying Characteristics&lt;br/&gt;Size/Form:&lt;br/&gt;Swamp chestnut oak is a large, deciduous tree that averages 60' to 80' in height with a 2' to 3' diameter. In rare cases it may grow as tall as 120' with a 7' diameter. In open areas, the crown is low and widely spreading, but the tree has a more compact form when grown within a forest.&lt;br/&gt;Leaves:&lt;br/&gt;The leaves are simple, alternately arranged, 4&quot; to 9&quot; long, and 2 ½&quot; to 5&quot; wide. They are obovate, broadest in the middle and above. The leaf base tapers to the petiole and the leaf tip is rounded. The upper leaf surface is lustrous, dark green and smooth while the underside is duller and fuzzy. Leaf margins are coarsely wavy-toothed. Leaves turn crimson in the fall.&lt;br/&gt;Fruit:&lt;br/&gt;The ovoid acorns are 1&quot; to 1 ½&quot; long and light to dull brown in color. The bowl-like cap covers 1/3 to ½ of the acorn and has distinct, wedge-shaped, triangular scales. Acorns mature in one season and may grow singularly or in clusters of two or three.&lt;br/&gt;Bark:&lt;br/&gt;The thick, light gray bark is irregularly furrowed with long, narrow scales and shaggy rectangular plates.&lt;br/&gt;Habitat:&lt;br/&gt;Swamp chestnut oak grows best in moist, poorly drained, bottomland soils where inundation occurs for a short duration. It is a common resident of mesic hardwoods or mixed pine and hardwood stands in bottomland forests, bluffs, ridges, and flatwoods with subsurface limestone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I strongly urge you to block the cache site with your car. Most likely you have done a cache like this before around here. It will be easy to do this cache at night. You shouldn't need a flashlight if you come at night. One last thing I have a pencil nub in the cache but it could disappear. Also any logs containing a spoiler even encrypted spoilers will be deleted.Also you must sign the log to claim a find. Please post needs maintnance if its frozen.</groundspeak:long_description>

This time we had a specific goal of getting to a milestone cache for LP5324 to commemorate his 3K milestone.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This could prove to be a fairly difficult hike depending on your
approach. It is very rocky, so use caution. The cache is well
hidden, but you should be able to find it with a little looking
around. Also because of the nature of the area, it may be difficult
to maintain a signal.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you enter the park, walk past the playground equipment, and
tennis courts, and take the paved bike path down. From there,
you're on your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This one was made more for the journey than the reward. I think
it's an interesting park, and something that I didn't expect to
find in Dublin. The cache is a small cache, so there's not much
room for swag. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is a decon container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 A word of warning. I stopped out here to check up on the cache
just after a heavy rain. It gets very slick all around the area,
and there is a lot of standing water after a rain. So if you head
out there when, or just after it rains please be careful.</groundspeak:long_description>

cache is only available sunrise to sunset. No night caching is
permitted. The cache is not on any headstones and no headstones
need to be disturbed or touched in any way.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is a small Lock-n-lock container, but does have some
room for small trades. It sits in a narrow place, but can easily be
lifted out though it might take a little twisting and turning just
the right way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not far from the cache you can find the grave of Sgt. William
Warrington. According to information on the headstone, he was born
on April 10, 1751 and died May 10, 1850 (according to the new
headstone. The original headstone lists the dates as Apr 29, 1751
and May 25, 1851)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During this time he served in both the Revolutionary War, and the
War of 1812.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His service in the Revolution included being a member of George
Washington's Elite Corps of Life Guards. Warrington also was
credited with directly saving Washington's life when he caught a
man trying to poison Washington's drink.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with any cemetery please be respectful. This cache is only
available sunrise to sunset. No night caching is permitted. The
cache is not on any headstones and no headstones need to be
disturbed or touched in any way.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please enjoy the view and remember CITO whenever
possible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*** Congratulations to Team JNLE4 for first to
find ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Congratulations to KBLAST for second to
find and introducing me to a new climbing method. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Congratulations to AlphaMonkey for TTF ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a two stage multi cache with a puzzle
into.  You will need climbing gear for stage two.  Take
your time enjoy the area, views, wildlife and as always Have FUN
and be safe while using caution at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do Not leave tradables in stage
one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been placed in conjunction with
“The Collaboration Project”, see details below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RACCOON’S
RUSH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robby the
raccoon has made a new home along the banks of the Scioto River,
just off Klondike Road where he spends his days snatching nuggets
of gold as they float down stream.  Unfortunately
Robby’s brother stole his stash of gold and relocated it,
solve the puzzle below to help him locate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pyramid
of gold consists of six pieces of gold and a bed of four rocks, a
total of 10.  Arrange the numbers 1 through 10 so that each
golden piece results in the positive difference of the two numbers
it rests upon.  I have given you two number’s in the
correct locations to avoid confusion in decrypting the
coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1038.photobucket.com/albums/a463/NamthCub/?action=view&amp;amp;current=Puzzle.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have
all the numbers in the correct location each number will correlate
to a letter, note that the number 10 represents zero
(0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see
reference chart above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE ONE is
located at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 0 °  H G . B I F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 3 °  I J . G G A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return
the Final stage back to its original location.  Once again
thank you for visiting my cache, &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;have
fun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;be
safe.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Collaboration Project&lt;/a&gt; Notes:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has also been placed as part of
‘The Collaboration Project’ (GC2BVZQ) puzzle.  You
will find a CODE in each stage of the cache*, the codes will be
needed to solve this puzzle.  To locate the other caches
needed for this puzzle, please refer to cache GC2BVZQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*If you need the code in stage two for The

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nice!  Found at 10:30PM in nearly complete darkness!  (My log said 11:30, because I read my watch wrong.)

I was looking for something to do tonight, after a boring day of sleeping in, then watching movies most of the day.  I wanted something just a little crazy, so I looked for &quot;climb gear required&quot; caches that were also &quot;available 24/7&quot;.   As I expected, not very many.  Even so, this one was available and fairly close, so I decided to go for it!  I sent a couple of e-mails to see if anyone else was feeling crazy, but it ended up being a solo mission.

Got to the parking area and frantically searched my pockets and car for the notepad with the solution to the puzzle..  Oops.  Oh well..I could still see the solution in my head, so I jotted the coordinates down and went to stage 1.  I found that container quickly and went for the final.
Before heading out, I was told that it might be possible without rope, so I left all of that in the car.  I stood there for a few minutes looking around, checking out how to do it with rope and then went down to make an attempt without gear.   The tree was a bit too smooth and definitely too wide for me to shimmy up...maybe if I had a slight boost I could have grabbed into some holes int he tree for hand holds.  Unfortunately, I was alone so I had to go back to the car for rope.

I had one obvious way to run the rope, and then maybe one that's a little risky since the tree is dead.  I checked out the &quot;risky&quot; method first because it was easier to get the line set.  The tree was definitely solid enough, so up I went.  I had the cache in hand, signed my name, and hung there in the tree for a while taking in the night air.

Doing it at night probably helped a lot, but that was a lot of fun!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A small Lock-n-lock container with room for a few trades.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with any cemetery cache, please be respectful. The cemetery is
only open from dawn until dusk, so no night caching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no reason to touch, or in any way disturb any graves or
buildings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located in the Old Radnor Welsh Cemetery, or
Troedhiwdalar. According to various accounts in the early to mid
1800's a group of people from Brecknockshire in Wales immigrated to
this area around what is now Radnor, and Delaware. By the 1870's
around 200 Welsh people were living in this area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please re-hide the cache well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A quick note: The paved drive way goes back to a private residence.
If you decide to park along there, please do not block the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A Three Hour Tour is a series of 7 caches located along the Scioto River. These caches are only accessible by small watercraft such as a canoe or kayak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series may take much longer than 3 hours, so plan accordingly. It took me almost 6 hours to place the caches. I strongly suggest taking water, and maybe some snacks...or a full lunch. A picnic on the river is always fun! You’ll probably want some sunscreen, and bug repellent too. Also, make sure any electronics, such as cell phones, are in waterproof containers that either float, or are attached to your boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested starting point is at the Hoskins Rd. bridge near &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/epkqb&quot;&gt;N40° 25.162 W083° 11.850&lt;/a&gt; parking can be found near the river gauge on the south side of the bridge along the western bank (river right) of the river. The suggested end is at the Warrensburg Rd. bridge near &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/2pufa&quot;&gt;N 40° 18.364 W 083° 10.076&lt;/a&gt;. This is about 9.5 miles downstream from the start. Parking can be found at the Warrensburg United Methodist Church. The bank directly behind the church is kind of steep and muddy. I suggest taking out right at the north side of the bridge along the eastern bank (river left) of the river. Then walking over the bridge to get your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use caution. This river is typically fairly shallow, and slow moving, however there are several areas of faster moving riffles. Please do not attempt during periods of flooding. Current river conditions can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=cle&amp;amp;gage=prgo1&quot;&gt;NOAA.gov&lt;/a&gt;.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This fourth cache in the series is a bison style container located on a small island. The area is in the middle of some riffles that can be fast moving at times. The western side of the island is protected and much calmer. My suggestion is to approach from the west. I personally went through the riffles on river left then curled back up around the southern end of the island.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A Three Hour Tour is a series of 7 caches located along the Scioto River. These caches are only accessible by small watercraft such as a canoe or kayak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series may take much longer than 3 hours, so plan accordingly. It took me almost 6 hours to place the caches. I strongly suggest taking water, and maybe some snacks...or a full lunch. A picnic on the river is always fun! You’ll probably want some sunscreen, and bug repellent too. Also, make sure any electronics, such as cell phones, are in waterproof containers that either float, or are attached to your boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested starting point is at the Hoskins Rd. bridge near &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/epkqb&quot;&gt;N40° 25.162 W083° 11.850&lt;/a&gt; parking can be found near the river gauge on the south side of the bridge along the western bank (river right) of the river. The suggested end is at the Warrensburg Rd. bridge near &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/2pufa&quot;&gt;N 40° 18.364 W 083° 10.076&lt;/a&gt;. This is about 9.5 miles downstream from the start. Parking can be found at the Warrensburg United Methodist Church. The bank directly behind the church is kind of steep and muddy. I suggest taking out right at the north side of the bridge along the eastern bank (river left) of the river. Then walking over the bridge to get your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

Not for anyone expecting a quick, easy park-n-grab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission has been given by the Ohio State Parks for this geocache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location was the spot where I placed my first Geocache back in 2002. After some time I believe it got washed away, and I archived it. I finally decided I needed to place another one here. The original location was about 100 feet from where the cache is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was named because there is a Bald Eagle nest not too far away, and at the time it was the only one in Delaware County. I placed it here to highlight that, plus I wanted something with a challenging hike, and some decent views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you visit this cache you will find there are no real trails to get you to the cache. If you pay close attention you might be able to follow trails made by fisherpeople, and deer paths. You will very likely run into thorns, nettles, poison ivy, logs hidden in the underbrush, ticks, snakes and other critters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also be careful during the various hunting seasons. It might be a good idea to wear blaze orange during these times as this is a legal hunting area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be found easily at two locations. The first is at the below dam area which gives you about a 3/4 mile, one way, hike. This area is located at N 40° 21.520 W 083° 04.325. This parking area closes at 9:30pm. The other location is located off of Panhandle Road. just north of the dike at N 40° 21.586 W 083° 03.251. This area, like the area of the cache is open until 11pm. This is a longer hike, but I've never measured it to see how far it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bald Eagle nest can be found by parking at the aforementioned spot on Panhandle Road, and walking east on top of the dike. The nest is located about 1/4 mile away in the top of a tree that stands pretty much alone on the south side of the dike. They don't always nest here, so you may not see anything. Also during certain times of the year, when they are more sensitive to people, the area will be off limits as marked by signs near the parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A picnic on the river is always fun! You’ll probably want some sunscreen, and bug repellent too. Also, make sure any electronics, such as cell phones, are in waterproof containers that either float, or are attached to your boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested starting point is at the Hoskins Rd. bridge near &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/epkqb&quot;&gt;N40° 25.162 W083° 11.850&lt;/a&gt; parking can be found near the river gauge on the south side of the bridge along the western bank (river right) of the river. The suggested end is at the Warrensburg Rd. bridge near &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/2pufa&quot;&gt;N 40° 18.364 W 083° 10.076&lt;/a&gt;. This is about 9.5 miles downstream from the start. Parking can be found at the Warrensburg United Methodist Church. The bank directly behind the church is kind of steep and muddy. I suggest taking out right at the north side of the bridge along the eastern bank (river left) of the river. Then walking over the bridge to get your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use caution. This river is typically fairly shallow, and slow moving, however there are several areas of faster moving riffles. Please do not attempt during periods of flooding. Current river conditions can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=cle&amp;amp;gage=prgo1&quot;&gt;NOAA.gov&lt;/a&gt;. This station is the station you will see at the put in coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first cache in the series is an ammo can located on a relatively large island. There is a lot of poison ivy, some nettles, and tons of mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between here and the start point you will pass an active Bald Eagle nest, so keep an eye out. While placing the cache I saw two different Bald Eagles flying around the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I should also add, there's a possibility that you may see a couple of caches along the way before this one. I had placed a few that I decided for various reasons not to list. So they're out there until I get around to removing them.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not much of a hike, but about 3/4 of a mile paddle from the nearest
boat launch, if you head out in a straight line.

This one is only accessable by boat. It's probably easiest with a
canoe, kayak, rowboat, or other small craft. The water is normally
pretty smooth, and there aren't a lot of power boats out there, but
you would still want to keep an eye out. Per park regulations you
cannot swim to this one, and it's also off-limits if you're
thinking about waiting until the lake freezes. Boat rentals are
available at the marina, if you don't have your own and want to
give it a try. 
&lt;p&gt;Also you're welcome to drive about on the park roads, and there
are some interesting places around, but please do not go off the
roads. In most areas there are red signs stating that you aren't to
take vehicles any further, but sometimes they are missing. If
there's any doubt, don't drive there, since you will be driving
through State Wildlife Area...although the cache IS placed with
State Park Officer permission, and is on State Park land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've rated it a 3 difficulty mainly because once in the cache
area, it's fairly overgrown, and there is a lot of poison ivy
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest parking/boat launch area is near N40 23.436 W083
02.568. These are approximate for now, but should be close. I will
mark an actual waypoint for parking soon. You can also park/launch
at the marina, but it would make for a little longer trip to the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache in a nice little community park. A small lock and
lock hidden in a typical manner.

A while back I had placed, and eventually archived &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3a1eb1c7-7d11-4f9f-b95a-1908f478aff1&quot;&gt;
The Infamous Battle Run&lt;/a&gt;. In my archival note I promised to
replace the cache, but never did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've finally gotten back out here. The location is not too far from
the old spot.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is accessible from &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAWN until
DUSK every day except for July 4th&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. The town
launches their fireworks not far from the cache, and it would be
off limits for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stream that the cache is hidden near is called the Battle Run.
According to local history, the creek was named as such because of
a small skirmish that happened here, outlined as follows...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
in 1820 the frontier settlements of what is now Prospect and the
surrounding townships became frightened by the possibility of
attack by the Wyandot Indians. A group of settlers formed a
horseback patrol called the &quot;Light Horse Guards.&quot; They were
stationed in Big Island and made frequent trips to the Prospect
area. During one such trip the Guards stopped to water their horses
at the Battle Run. One of the Light Horse Guards, named Morgan, got
into a skirmish with an Indian who demanded Morgan's necktie.
During the fight, Morgan grabbed the Indian's gun and hit him over
the head. At that time a number of Indians came out of hiding and
began to shoot at the settlers. Naturally, the Guards fled, and no
one else was injured. The next day, the Light Horse Guards returned
to find the Indians still in the area. The man that Morgan had hit
was found with a blanket over his head over a hot pot of water.
This method was used to cure many ailments. The Indian and Morgan
agreed to terms of peace. Morgan was to give a cart-load of
pumpkins to the Indian, and in return the Indian was to provide
Morgan with a saddle of venison. Following that peace was returned
to the settlement and the native villages of the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

easy to find. As always, make sure to hide the cache well.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;**Permission for this cache has been given by the Marion
County Parks District**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Park is open from &lt;u&gt;dawn to dusk&lt;/u&gt;, and there is video
surveillance, so no night caching is permitted.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Only accessible from OH-203. Please do not try to find it from OH-4
or Newmans-Cardington Rd. There is a pull off on OH-4, but that is
private property if you try to come from that side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is just located off of the walking path at Green Spur
Nature Preserve. There is NO NEED TO BUSHWHACK. After parking at
the gate (even if the gate is open, please park at the gate),
continue to follow the gravel path back. Just after the gravel ends
you will see a trail on your right that passes between some
concrete structures. Continue to follow this path until you find
the cache. The trail is right along the property line. The property
line is well marked, but please do not stray from the trail.
&lt;p&gt;From Marion County Parks District's webpage.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Greenspur is a seven acre wooded area. It is on the spur line from
the old Interurban line to the old power plant along the Scioto
River. It is largely second-growth woodland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This land was donated to the park district by former Marion County
Commissioner John Watkins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We hope that this park will eventually be the northern terminus of
the C, D, &amp; M rail-trail, which will come north from Delaware,
Ohio.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is still a work in progress. The pond and wetlands
were the first addition, and nature trails are currently in the
works. There are plans to possibly add a shelter house and a more
extensive network of trails here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the local Boy Scouts occasionally camp here, so
please try not to disturb them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is a Lock-n-lock container that is just a little
smaller than an ammo can. Plenty of room for trades!</groundspeak:long_description>

respectful. Caching from dawn until dusk only.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cemetery is the oldest cemetery in Marion. It was laid out by
Eber Baker, Marion's founder, in 1822. It was originally the
resting place of the families of many of Marion's founders. Some of
those graves were apparently moved to the newer Marion Cemetery
when it was opened. In June of 1854 Marion experienced a cholera
epidemic. As a result 65 of Marion's 1300 people died, and most of
them were buried here.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately time and vandals have not been kind to this old
cemetery, so only a few headstones remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no dedicated parking. I have always parked along the south
side of Quarry St. when I've visited here. Please be careful, and
respectful of the cemetery. Only visit between dawn and dusk. There
should be no reason to cross any marked graves.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The trails are rocky and flanked by steep drops on both sides in
places. There will also be areas where you will have to step across
crevices. The trail is mostly flat but there are some elevation
changes. The hike will be about .40/mi one way. A relatively small,
camouflaged Lock-n-Lock.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This has always been one of my favorite areas, and I recently found
out that it was purchased by the city and turned into a park a
little while back. When I was younger I used to paintball, and
mountain bike back through here. At that time we had &quot;blind eye&quot;
permission to be there. When I started caching this was one of the
first areas I thought about placing a cache, but the private
property issue stopped me. So I was thrilled to find out it's now a
public park. Ok, enough babbling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not suggested for kids or anyone with a fear of heights.
Like I said above, the terrain is rather tough. It starts out easy
but then follows along a narrow stone ridge between two old
quarries. Part of the trail are wide enough for one person with
long drops on either side. I would also suggest not going after
this one when it's dark, wet, or snowy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Park at N 40° 36.535 W 083° 09.108 (off of Hillman Ford
Rd./Fountain St.) and enter the woods to the south of the parking
area. The park has recently expanded, and all quarry operations
have pulled out. That leaves a new, and legal, parking area open.
It's a slightly longer walk from the new parking area, but there
are some remains of the quarry operations along the way that are
interesting. Depending on exactly how you head in you may see half
of an old park boundary sign that no longer applies with the new
addition. The sign is very near to the limestone mound you'll
pass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be sure to hide the cache as you found it. Even though it
can be a rough hike there's evidence that people do come out here
with some frequency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKKCEQ - Parking for Quarry Cache&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 36.535 W 083° 09.108&lt;br /&gt;Older parking area off of Hillman-Ford Rd./Fountain St.&lt;br /&gt;QPKCEQ - Newer parking.  Slightly longer hike.&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 36.210 W 083° 09.017&lt;br /&gt;Accessed by turning north off of Fairground street just east of the railroad.  It may seem like you're turning onto the railroad right-of-way...and you are, but it is completely legal, and there is a park rules sign at the gate.  It has small print so it is difficult to read from Fairground St.</groundspeak:long_description>

I finally broke loose and made the 2 hour drive here today. I was not disappointed in the least bit and think this is one of the best caches in Ohio I have done. Great views and a great hike. There was a muggle sitting right at the cache location so I just told her what I was doing so I didn't creep her out. She thought it was cool and even joined me in the hunt.
Once located I showed her the container and I signed the old log book.

Spent some time looking around and began the hike back. 

Thanks for this great cache.

Easy walk, through a nice old cemetery, with a little bit of a
hill. The cache is a decon box. As with any cemetery cache, DO NOT
try to find this at night, and be respectful.

This cache was placed in memory of a dear friend, SherwoodForest. 
&lt;p&gt;Eric &quot;SherwoodForest&quot; was a very special Geocacher. A
Self-Proclaimed Ambassador, he not only represented the Northeast
Ohio Geocachers at events in other areas, he was an advocate for
the entire sport to park districts, lawmakers, and even people on
the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that with an attitude like this, that Eric might
have been arrogant or boastful. Nothing could be further from the
truth. Eric has a mild demeanor that earned him the common
description &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;. Eric won friends by listening. He
encouraged and welcomed the people who were least convinced of
their sanity in enjoying such an underground sport. He encouraged
people on to their personal bests and challenged all of us to
expect more from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric is partly responsible for many big initiatives in Ohio. He
was instrumental in the formation of GeocacheOhio (GO) and the
Midwest GeoBash. He helped promote the All-Ohio Women's Event and
aided in the flight of the men-folk with the matching &quot;Ohio Men's
Escape Weekend&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric is truely missed, but in so many ways his influence is all
around us. It's in the people, the caches and the culture of
Geocaching. To represent this, we have chosen to dedicate a series
of caches that we hope will represent the impact that our friend,
SherwoodForest had on our sport and our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Eric would say, &quot;Cache well, and see you 'round the
bend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cemetery is in the small town of Mexico. From what I could
tell, there is no post office, or commerce, but more of just a
community. I orignally came here looking for Badger Cemetery, but I
couldn't find it. I decided to stop here and look around, and found
many Badgers here. After some research it appears that Badger
Cemetery was relocated here, in Mexico Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is an attempt to make a challenging cache for the die
harders. Not everyone is expected to attempt to log this. Never
attempt a cache you are not comftorable with.

Park on the South side of the river for this one and there is a
nice social trail on the island to take you to the cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is an interesting spot I had visited many times when I
was younger. It is possible to reach it without aid of a boat, but
it takes a little guts. Now, the words of warning. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;*DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE RIVER WHEN THE WATER IS
HIGH*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;*IF USING A BOAT TO APPROACH THIS CACHE, DO SO FROM THE
LOWER LEVEL*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If walking, I've found the best way to do it is to scoot your feet,
not picking them up. The water off the back of the dam is normally
only a few feet deep (knee level on me), so walk towards that side.
You will also have to walk in the water on that side upon reaching
the other side of the dam. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you are across, enjoy for the minute the wonderful view you
will see from this location. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While in the area, there are several other caches to hunt within a
few miles. You might want to pack a picnic, and make a day of it.
The view at sunset from the area overlooking the dam is wonderful.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is full of little trinkets found around heathers house. I
will bring a travel bug back to this location once I obtain some.
Sign the log book and have a good time!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I planned to do this one last summer but things happened that hindered me getting here to do it. This is one of those caches that takes you to a place that if it wasn't for geocaching you just may never have the desire to go there. What a wonderful cache that has to be planned out to coincide with decent weather and a group makes it more worth the effort as well as perhaps overcoming fear. Although I was comfortable walking the dam today I was very watchful over my sons. I had slipped and fell and almost went over this dam when I was a kid fishing with my uncle. This was the 1st time I have been on it since and I knew being 200 lbs heavier I wouldn't have a problem today.

Thanks for an awesome adventure and I have to say this one is probably the best cache I have done to date. I hope it sticks around for a long time.
Thanks to teamMina for going along with us today and taking the pictures and I too laughed when members of our groups slipped. My group went on to do the other river cache close by and when all was said and done I was the only one that remained dry.

Coordinates were right on the spot!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;While cleaning out the storage room where my cache stuff was I
came across a large stash of potential cache containers. I figured
while I was out doing maint on Spooky Park I might as well hide my
first cache in several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at the Perrysburg Heights Community Center - a
small little park in the back corner of the area called &quot;Perrysburg
Heights&quot;. I'm surprised noone has dropped a cache back here
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is close to home so I should be able to maintain it.
As a matter of fact it's close to work too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

items. Should be an easy grab.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Old description follows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While out geocaching with Jason, we drove past a park that he
was familiar with. Out of the blue, he says &quot;let's hide a cache
there!&quot; It so happened that I had a pre-made micro cache that I was
given at the MiGo Winter Social, so this was a perfect opportunity
to hide it. Jason says him and his friends called it the spooky
park back in the day. It's really not that spooky -- It's a run
down old park with flipped over picnic benches and rusted out old
grilles. It looks like the locals now use it for paintball. Cache
is in the far back corner of the old park. The container has a
logbook, a candle, a MiGo wooden coin, and a few other items that
were already in the pre-made cache. I didn't even look closely at
the contents! Special thanks to the MiGo folks for the container
and the contents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Below here is new&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container will be replaced shortly with a new non-microfilm
container - smallish plastic storage container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And even newer as of 5/15/2011&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container has been replaced with another black microfilm. I
found the last version of this cache 86' from the posted coords
floating in what appears to be the seat of a fort. Considering all
the activity I seem to see back here from teenagers, I've relocated
the cache away from here.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The coordinates take you to the first stage of this multi-staged puzzle cache.  At this stage, you will find a piece of information you need to solve the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second stage is a hide-a-key.  It doesn't have room for a pencil, so please bring one.  I suspect the next crypto will have a bigger end stage, but this is still a fairly easy one!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cryptogram is below.  Upon decoding it, you will be able to find the second stage of this cache.  Since so many people have found the first crypto challenge, I thought it was time to up the stakes a little.  This cipher is different, but not necessarily harder then the last one.  As always, I will offer hints on a limited basis if you get really stuck, but not like last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the Cyptogram!  Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

safest place to park.


This is our first cache, and in a park named after our first state,
so I figured the name was appropriate. This is a little park along
the river. It has no trails, but you often see fishermen down at
the mouth of the creek in the summer fishing. The name of the park
is &quot;Delaware Creek Park&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To get to the parking area, you will have to approach from the
back. You can do this off Marango on river road. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a small Mooptainer. It is fairly well hidden. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It contains a small number of items as it is fairly hard to get
larger items in it. &lt;br /&gt;

downtown near the oliver house - I enjoy this place, and the view.
Small magnetic micro - bring a pencil. This is the first of several
I hope to place downtown where I work.

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the Oliver House. This historic house
is the oldest standing structure downtown. From this spot, you have
a wondeful view of the Anthony Wayne Bridge, the Oliver House, and
of course the Toledo skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now converted to a restaraunt complex, it houses Mutz,
Rockwells, and the Maumee Bay Brewing Company. The Brewpub is now
the brewer of Buckeye Beer, which was very well known back in the
early 1900's. The following information is from beerfestivals.org:
Few non-beer geeks know that Buckeye Brewing played a significant
role in American brewing history. Struggling to survive, the
brewery sold its recipe for light beer to Chicago-based Peter Hand
Brewing Company, which sold it under the name &quot;Meister Bräu Lite.&quot;
While Peter Hand knew how to brew light beer, it didn't know how to
market it. Enter Miller Brewing Company, which bought the recipe
and, more importantly, the &quot;Lite&quot; trademark. Miller coined the
phrase, &quot;everything you wanted in a beer, and less&quot;; recruited
retired athletes such as Bubba Smith and John Madden as endorsers;
and put its marketing muscle behind new Miller Lite. And you all
know the rest of that story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Thursday nights I can be found inhabiting Mutz, which is on
the premises. If you are in the area hunting the cache, stop in and
say hi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, come one, come all! Visit this historic place - take in the
view, and sign the cache log!&lt;/p&gt;

Had to move a little bit to make the grab on this one, but was an easy find in a nice location. Stopped by to take a snap of the historical marker nearby and take a picture as well. TNLNSL.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on some public hunting land in Petersburg, Michigan. So it would be a good recommendation to search for this cache when Its NOT hunting season! The cache shouldn't be difficult to find but the terrain getting to the cache will prove to be the most difficult part of your journey. So if you love a excellent bushwhacking adventure this is the cache for you!! Long pants and boots are strongly encouraged (don't head out in crocs and shorts like I did!). Please note the attributes, poison ivy and ticks can be a problem but are easily avoided long pants are worn. You can park in the small parking lot (the lot nearest to Teal road) along Lulu road. That should give you the shortest and easiest walk to the cache! This cache ls located near one of my favorite family campgrounds, TotemPole Park! So if you want to make a weekend trip out of this one check them out they have a great facility! PLEASE BYOP AND DO NOT MOVE THE CACHE!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located in a neat location and finding it will lead you a very beautiful location at sterling which overlooks Lake Erie. This cache is a micro cache and may be difficult to spot right away. You will need a sharp eye and strong legs. Some climbing (boulder climbing) will be required in order to get up to it. Please bring your own writing utensil. Parking is avaiable in the Sterling State Park Beach parking lot. Please be mindful of any construction traffic. Be sure to watch out for muggles and it would be great if you would do a little CITO along the way, the fishermen leave lots behind! And lastly, please be careful with the container! I spent a lot of time on making it and it is very small. If dropped, you will probablly never be able to retrieve it! So hold onto it tightly! Thanks and good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1) boulder climbing will be required 2) urban container. It blends into the environment in which it's STUCK to. 3) I'm located along a fence.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">THIS IS A NIGHT CACHE! PLEASE DONT ATTEMPT TO FIND THIS DURING DAYTIME HOURS (Will be very difficult and will defeat the purpose of the cache itself.)&lt;br/&gt;If im not mistaken, this should be the first cache of its kind here in Monroe, MI. That being said it is my first time placing a cache of this kind so please bear with me and please message me with suggestions/ improvements. Please be aware that reading the HINTS and viewing cache PHOTOS may spoil your cache experience, use only if needed. Note this is a Micro cache container, so please bring your own pen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a variety of ways to get to this cache but I recommend the following...&lt;br/&gt;- Start by parking your car infront of the MCCC Gerald Welch Health Education Building (H) - N 41*55.151', W 083*28.134'&lt;br/&gt;- Begin by walking around to the rear of the building and walk towards the DTE Solar Energy Field.&lt;br/&gt;- From that point you should have no problem finding your way to listed coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above coordinates will take you the STARTING point of the trail in which the cache is located along. Make sure you start down the correct trail, there are two trailheads very close to oneanother! You will NEED a flashlight (Headlamp Suggested!). From there on you will search for reflective trail markers located about head level (about 5'10&quot;). Please note that all (aprox. 25) trail markers are located on the same side of the trail. These trail markers are invisible during the day and highly reflective (brown-orange color) when light is directed at them during the night. If using only a flashlight make sure to hold it about head level to get max reflection. Otherwise you may have a hard time finding the tacks! You will know you are close to the cache when you discover 3 trail markers in a triangular formation on a single tree. When you spot this you can begin your search for the cache itself. Please also note that this tree is not directly along the main trail but isnt far away from it. It shouldnt be a problem to get to (even in the dark) provididing you follow the markers. Please note that MCCC campus security has been notified about this cache. You shouldn't have any issues searching for this one even at night!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE HAVE A GREAT TIME CACHING! Be safe and your caching expierence should make for a great adVENTURE!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1) @ the coords, take the first trail on your left. (DONT GO STRAIGHT!) 2) at the triangle, search in a 3ft radius of the specified tree</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I would recommend decoding them top to bottom. As you read more of my hints the more the cache is spoiled. FYI parking is available in the St. Marys Park parking lot. Cross the pedestrian bridge to the entrance of the riverwalk.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">To the reviewer who asked if this cache had to do with venturing (not sure how else to relply). YES! this does have something to do with venturing. I am the president of my venturing crew (crew 734 in Ida, Michigan) and I also serve as a BSA Geocaching merit badge counselor. I thought it would be nice to to have the crew and myself make up a few caches for the community and my geocaching classes to find. We were doing a service project at the battlefield and saw a good place to hide a cache so we asked and gained permission.</groundspeak:text>

The southern shore of Lake Erie was at one time occupied by the Eries, a tribe of Indians from which the lake derived its name. This name is always mentioned by the early French writers as meaning &quot;cat&quot;; Lac du Chat means &quot;Lake of the Cat.&quot; Many attribute this reference to the wild cat or panther; the Eries' name for themselves was &quot;The People of the Panther.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located within Lake Erie Metro Metropark, a part of the Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority park system. A Metropark Vehicle Entry Permit is required:&lt;br/&gt;Annual Permit $25, Senior Permit $15, Daily Permit $5. For general information please call 810-227-2757 or 1-800-47-PARKS, or visit our website at www.metroparks.com. All park rules and regulations apply. Park in parking lots only. Check the Metroparks website for park hours.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This park has heavy foot and bike traffic so please use stealth when retrieving these caches                                                                &lt;br/&gt;Minimal bushwhacking required.  Close parking is available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At stage 1 you will find coords only which can be obtained without leaving the trail. &lt;br/&gt;Main cache is in a 6”x 9”x 3 ½” Camo Tupperware container (within 50’ of a main path)   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you take time to visit the nature center, wave pool, and huge kids play area.  Also take time to stop by the boat launch, which is a very popular area for bird watching.  There are many nice boardwalks and paths throughout the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;FPHYWD - Lac Du Chat 1st Stage and Final&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 04.553 W 083° 11.907</groundspeak:long_description>

Decided to grab a couple after golf today.  I think rest stops get wierd at dusk/after dark.  There were alot of truckers here and guys staring at me.  Felt a little uncomfortable.

Easy find.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>There is a small trail south of the main trail mentioned above. If you head south up this hill you will see a steep mossy hill off to your left(east). There is a fallen small/medium tree. It is buried under a few leaves next to the fallen tree. Good Luck! </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

There are lots of toys for all ages.  Please note there are no Tracker Jackers in the cache!  (or are they?!?). This nice trail continues to a small bridge.  You can continue past the bridge and go along the yard and the trail picks up along the yard on the other side of the subdivision street.  There is public parking at Rotary Park, where the trail starts on the south side of the parking lot.  Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is the first in the OC only series of Contrary Vaters.&lt;br/&gt;I don't like giving detailed descriptions for my hides unless I find it to be important, rendering this description non-contrary.&lt;br/&gt;I prefer placing caches with function beyond caching or have a potential nerve wracking terrain.&lt;br/&gt;I prefer to place caches above, in or at the least near water.&lt;br/&gt;I'm also not known for camouflage.&lt;br/&gt;I am extremely picky about my coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;Let me tell you how picky.&lt;br/&gt;My GPSr will do waypoint averaging with a dilution of precision threshold and it displays a accuracy deviation. I set my GPSr in the spot for the cache and run the averaging for a half hour minimum, If the sample shows a deviation of more than 15' then I reject it and start over again. Then I repeat the process on a different day during a different time, several times over and then average them all.&lt;br/&gt;I also take an average every time I do cache maintenance but I reject any that deviate more than 10'. &lt;br/&gt;This time:&lt;br/&gt;I have taken 1 sample and during a rain storm to boot!&lt;br/&gt;I have camouflaged the container.&lt;br/&gt;The terrain is simple.&lt;br/&gt;The only water that came into the picture is the rain.&lt;br/&gt;Heck I'm even supplying a hint!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is your hint... &quot;SAND&quot;&lt;br/&gt;WOW I didn't even try to hide it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't bother telling me the coords are off because I know that they may be at times and at other times they may not be.&lt;br/&gt;I am willing to add any vague hint you may come up with but do not post them, as there are ways to contact me privately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ya know on second thought. &quot;tracking AT warlocks-box.com&quot;&lt;br/&gt;change AT to @ and remove the extraneous spaces.&lt;br/&gt;A word of warning about this e-mail address, if you decide to use it for any other reason than the one I have put forth then you will end up permanently blocked for it. No ifs ands or buts, I don't care if you are praising me, calling me god and sending me 10% of your income. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra notes:&lt;br/&gt;Once this cache gets 5 legitimate sounding DNFs then I will take the Physical education out of it and supply an encrypted hint.&lt;br/&gt;Some of my Contrary Vaters (not this one) will be listed with a note that &quot;Once this cache has existed for 6 month, IF you have a better placement that this cache interferes with then contact me.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is hidden from view by approximately 20 feet of water. You need to be a certified scuba diver to find it. Bring a compass. The total dive time will be about 30 minutes. A standard AL80 should be sufficient. Do not attempt to find the cache when there is ice on the pond. The bottom is very silty. When you find the cache, take it to the table you passed on the way, and open it on the table. If something falls out onto the bottom, it will likely be lost forever. Bring a pencil for signing the log. Pencils may desintegrate when submerged for a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located in Spring Mill Pond, in Island Lake park. At the coordinates listed, you'll find a shelter. From the shelter, head straight North into the pond. It starts very shallow, then drops off to about 25 ft. After the drop off, you'll find a big platform. From the platform, two lines head out West. Take the Southern most line. It has a few tie-off points and ends at a big square object. From the next corner over, on this object, there is a line heading North. Follow this line. It ends at a big, rusty drum, and there another line heads off West, a short distance to a picknick table. Here, one line heads South, one heads West. Follow the line West. The location of the cache is marked by a yellow arrow, reading &quot;geocache&quot;. Bring a jump line of at least 20 feet. The cache is located in a cinder block at the end of the line. </groundspeak:long_description>

Looking for a small&lt;br/&gt;container. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Southeast Michigan's first cache to use Garmin's new&lt;br/&gt;chirp™ technology. In order to find this cache, you will need&lt;br/&gt;a chirp™-enabled Garmin GPSr (Garmin Oregon 300, 400, 450 or&lt;br/&gt;550; Garmin Dakota 20; or the Garmin GPSMAP 62 / 78) updated with&lt;br/&gt;the latest software (see the Garmin web site for&lt;br/&gt;details) The chirp™ is a tiny wireless transmitter that,&lt;br/&gt;when within range of an enabled GPSr, will convey the final cache&lt;br/&gt;coordinates to that GPSr, as well as a hint and the number of times&lt;br/&gt;an enabled GPSr has encountered the chirp™. This is a quick 2&lt;br/&gt;stage multi. When you get within range with your Chirp enabled GPS,&lt;br/&gt;you'll be given the coordinates for Stage 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me know what you think! Please follow all park rules, including&lt;br/&gt;hours of operation. Generally, all Warren parks are dawn to dusk&lt;br/&gt;unless otherwise posted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since this is a new technology, I'm not sure how sensitive the&lt;br/&gt;various GPS models are to the chirp signal. I know that they claim&lt;br/&gt;a distance of 30 meters, but as they say, your mileage may vary! If&lt;br/&gt;you're having a problem getting the signal, standing on the cement&lt;br/&gt;in the corner just northeast of the barbeque should be plenty&lt;br/&gt;close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like this Chirp, you may want to check out &lt;br/&gt;West Flint Chirp of the Nazarene - GC2MRA4!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Some trinkets and FTF gets the bag of coins.&lt;br/&gt;I went biking around this undeveloped area of the sub (lots of paths) and said to myself, &quot;Self, this place needs a cache.&quot; So here we go. The name comes from the name of the sub. Gemstone Valley.&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of bushes to hide you from muggles. &lt;br/&gt;Feel free to hike or bike around the other paths further into the area.

And of course do some caching.  To our surprise we were able to complete all the ACC Event caches.  What great weather we had today, do not think we will have many more like it this year.  Thanks to all that it took to put this together.   Found cache about  4:20 PM for my 10348 find.

You will need one&lt;br/&gt;of the new Garmin Chirp enabled GPSr units to be able to find this&lt;br/&gt;cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first chirp cache and I wanted to have a little fun&lt;br/&gt;with this new technology. Thanks to srstuart for his help with&lt;br/&gt;setting up this cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive at the posted coords with your Chirp enabled&lt;br/&gt;GPSr, you will be given further instructions as to how to find the&lt;br/&gt;final. For a list of compatible Garmin GPS's, please see the&lt;br/&gt;Garmin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chirp page for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2/3/11: Since this is a new technology, I'm not sure how sensitive&lt;br/&gt;the various GPS models are to the chirp signal. I know that they&lt;br/&gt;claim a distance of 30 meters, but as they say, your mileage may&lt;br/&gt;vary! Given some of the comments, I updated the coords to be closer&lt;br/&gt;to the building, but the original coordinates were well within the&lt;br/&gt;&quot;30 meter&quot; range. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like this Chirp, you may want to check out &lt;br/&gt;Butcher's Chirp! - GC2KFM5!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It did make for some very muddy areas but it still was better that freezing temps.  I was also able to break my old record of 52 caches in a day, new record set today is 62.  Well this one gave me some problems.  Found the chirp and it started downloading and then stopped at 15%.  Restarted and could not pick up the chirp signal again.  So we just went off Gnarles GPS.  I think there are still some bugs to be worked out of this new chirp software.  I think I will give it another try on Saturday while I am at the event.  Found cache about 12:00 PM for my 11186 find.

Davison Dog Park is VERY close to this cache, so you might want to bring your geopooch along with you and spend some time here. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail is paved and handicap accessible.  This cache, however, is not and it may be VERY hazardous in winter.  Cache with caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had disabled this cache during the build of the dog park but now it's up and running and ready to go, so have fun with this one.  I did up the rating on this cache because of the terrain and the fact that it can get bad in winter.  In summer you can probably knock a point off of the terrain rating.</groundspeak:long_description>

Room for small tradeable items only. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located on Richfield Township property near the police department. This is a daylight cache only and with the police being housed nearby, I wouldn't suggest pushing your luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sherwood Forest used to be a concert venue located in Richfield Township. It was a very popular site with the younger crowds during the early 1970's. As a matter of fact, many top bands performed at Sherwood Forest. Most, of course, before they became famous. The fact that I remember the most about Sherwood Forest is that it was the place where Bob Seger first played &quot;Turn the Page&quot; publicly. The crowd received it so well that he made it part of his tour and recorded it shortly afterwards. So for you oldtimers, you'll definitely be walking down nostalgia lane when you find this cache. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to Richfield Supervisor Joe Medore for his help in getting this cache placed, and for providing the news article included inside the cache. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We found out that the cachers in this area mush go into hibernation during the winter as a lot of caches have not been found this year.  We also noticed a lot of the caches are not winter friendly.  Still it was a good day to just get out and not be stuck in the house.  Found cache about  5:50 PM for my 11289 find.

We found out that the cachers in this area mush go into hibernation during the winter as a lot of caches have not been found this year.  We also noticed a lot of the caches are not winter friendly.  Still it was a good day to just get out and not be stuck in the house.  Found cache about  6:20 PM for my 11292 find.

It has since plummeted in status, but is still in the top 10. Ogidaki is the Woods Cree word for mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the below waypoints, follow the points below along some old logging roads. Follow it to the Top of the mountain, and enjoy the hike. There is a Fire tower up here that has been modernized and automated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total hiking time varies greatly by how far you wish to take your car up the logging roads. Bring water, food, bug spray and bear repellent of your choice.</groundspeak:long_description>
