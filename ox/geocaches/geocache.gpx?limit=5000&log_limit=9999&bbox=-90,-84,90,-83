There are many roads to to nowhere, this one has been replaced by a larger multi-lane highway.
This road to nowhere no leads to.....my cache
This is an easy grab while out running errands or passing through the area since there are several area restaurants and its approximately .4 miles off Interstate 985 exit 4.

BYOP, tweezers &amp; micro log roller if you have one.

For the FTF, In the leaves below the nano is a homemade golf ball micro for you to hide, complete with log. Please dont mistake this for my cache.

Kudos to Harborspy and Joebids on FTF

It has since gone away but to pay homage to the cache that got us started I have placed a multi-stage with all stages in the park.  It also an attempt at something other than a simple micro in a typical container.  It is a small container with a few swag items.

I have attempted to avoid hazards such as prickers and poison plants, however, come summer, keep your eyes open.  As the weather gets warmer the number of muggles dramatically increases, please re-hide all containers well.  Weekends during the summer can be VERY busy.

Park hours are currently 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.

So we did. The cache is a cammoed lock and lock which is good for a few trade items. Please be sure to hide back carefully since there is a fair bit of traffic in this park-- We saw a beach picnic, a runner, and a hiker while we were there. This one is interesting. There are several ways to get to it ranging from a walk on the beach to a trail hike with breaking waves in the background. I'm not sure how long this one will last-- maybe a season or two before I have to relocate it. But in the meantime-- enjoy. In addition, I have enabled it only for premium members-- at least for the next year</groundspeak:long_description>

It shouldn't be too hard to find, but watch out for thorns (and bees in the summer.) The Brock Clan decided to place this cache in the same park as our first find: &quot;By Land or By Sea&quot; which had sentimental value to us since it was the first one we found, but has since been archived. It's a nice hike along a hardpack trail. Great place to take your dogs also. The first one was muggled, so please hide back carefully.

I have added a new log book and lots of new SWAG. Can it be gotten without a boat. Well, that's a tough question. If the lake is low, maybe a walk or a wade will do.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a quick two-stage cache on easy terrain which starts in a cemetery close to the Brock Clan.

This two-stage cache begins with the coordinates to a tombstone in a cemetery close to the Brock Clan. This fellow was born on Halloween and lived to be seventeen.

Once located, the tombstone will lead you to the final cache if you take the year he was born and subtract 1,414. The result will give you a three digit number to complete the latitude coordinates of N34 21._ _ _;

Next take the year he died and subtract 1,317. The result will give you a three digit number to complete the longitude coordinates of W083 51._ _ _.

The final cache is not far away (you could hike to it, but I recommend taking your vehicle.) Please be respectful when parking by the cemetery. It is best to park along the fence line close to the road. Please re-hide the cache well as it will be easy to muggle if you don't. I have placed lots of cool stuff in the cache as usual including some coin (real coin, not geocoin) for the first to find. This is the first cache placed by me and my youngest daughter-- hope you enjoy finding it as much as we enjoyed placing it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Kituwah Mound

The land has always been honored and respected by the Cherokee. It is considered sacred and not to be abused. The land was honored by the Cherokee because the land contained the dust of their ancestors and this was the place where they were put by Unethlvnvhi - Creator - to live and to take care of. 

And to the Cherokee, no place is more sacred than The Kituwah Mound. Located in a cool, green valley, nestled deep within the Great Smoky Mountains in Cherokee country, is an unimposing mound only 170 feet in diameter and five feet high. But its size belies its importance to the Cherokee. The was Kituwah, the place of the “first fire” establishing them as a people. This was Kituwah, a few hundred acres of pasture bordering the Tuckagee River of North Carolina, the place of the stories that the grandmothers told about, about the way the river turns, about the smell of the damp grass first thing in the morning. 

For the most part of the 20th century it had been in the hands of others. Each spring, the European settlers plowed, cultivated and farmed the valley, each year the mound growing smaller and smaller, hidden by shoulder-high corn. In 1996, this land once again became Cherokee land. Since then the tribe has disagreed over the future of the property; some wanting economic development, the other for the spiritual preservation due to its significance as an historic site. In the end, it was ogana (groundhog) who pointed the way. More on that later. In the words of Tom Belt, now a counselor for at-risk Native American Youth, “It’s easy to imagine how this flat piece of land, surrounded by the peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains, was prized as a refuge. This was where the people were first given fire, this is where it all began. This place wasn’t just a town - this was like the Vatican. This was the Cherokee “holiest of holies.” 

From the study of stone points found at Kituwah, some archaeologists estimate the site has been occupied for over 10,000 years. Pottery and other evidence indicate that the Cherokee have been here for at least 800 years. For centuries, the massive, round council house stood atop the mound, protecting the Cherokee’s sacred hearth - the fire. In annual ceremonies, the people would come to Kituwah from the surrounding settlements to light their fires from the source. James Mooney wrote in his 1900 ethnography Myths of the Cherokee that members of the tribe “frequently speak of themselves as Anikitu’hwagi and that the name was used in council to indicate genuine Cherokee feeling in its highest form.” Today, Kituwah lies near the Eastern Band’s Reservation, a time enclave where some 12,000 tribal members live. 

There is no doubt that Kituwah Mound and the village that surrounded it were once the spiritual center of a nation that sprawled over seven modern states, equal in size to the present day Virginia, or half the size of Great Britain. The European invasion brought drastic changes to the Cherokee resulting in a series of punitive raids by British soldiers, who razed Kituwah in 1761 and 1776. Hardship, population pressure, and false treaties pushed the Cherokee farther and farther into the Great Smoky Mountains. And then there were the 16,000 or so Cherokee who were removed from their land by Andrew Jackson’s infamous Indian Removal Act, rammed through Congress in 1830. Thousands died on that journey - a journey that became known as the Trail of Tears - a journey where close to a fourth of their number died from hunger and exposure. A few managed to remain behind, foregoing their Cherokee ties to become US citizens but enabling them to stay in the remote valleys near Kituwah. 

One spring recently a tribal member was working in his garden within sight of the Kituwah Mound when he came across part of a skull, a jawbone, and other human bones lying in loose dirt unearthed by ogana (groundhog). It didn’t take long for police to determine these were not recent bones. There were many who say ogana was an omen and joked that ogana was a true tribal archaeologist. There have been small excavations around the site, but the mound itself is too sensitive to touch. Instead, a device known as a flux-gradiometer that measures magnetic anomalies in the soil was used to authenticate the site. What emerged was a grainy, black and white image, showing the distinct outline of buried, burned walls that once belonged to a series of massive, round council houses built successively one on top of the other. In the center was a dark mass, the magnetic image of a centuries-old hearth. 

The future of the site is still unclear, but preservationists and archaeologists are optimistic and tribal officials now say that large-scale development is unlikely. At Kituwah, the Cherokee took control of their history and put archaeologists to work in their interest. 

Local tribal members continue to hold picnics on the banks of the river, within sight of Kituwah. They keep the mound mowed, all except for a tuft of high grass at the very center. In among the tall grass are little piles of fresh, red dirt. They represent an old tradition. For centuries, visitors to the sacred mound brought earth from their hearths - from their homes - to add to the mound. In an emotional ceremony held in 1998, several hundred children from the reservation’s elementary school gathered at the mound. All of them had been asked to bring a bag of dirt from their homes to spread on the mound. To the delight of the organizers and teachers, not one came to school that day empty-handed. Standing on the mound, Tom Belt chokes up the memory. “You’re talking about kids who can’t speak Cherokee, who watch TV all the time. All of a sudden they reach back in time and say that’s part of who we are. The very first rebuilding of the mound, it was the children who did it. Our ancestors are buried here. That’s what they needed to see. When we begin to do these things again, who we are begins to mean something again.”

In 2010, the Kituwah site was at the center of a major controversy involving Cherokee cultural heritage and big business. In December of 2009 Duke Energy began clearing a site which overlooked the Kituwah Mound site. They were planning to build a $52 million dollar electrical substation on the site, but had not consulted with tribal leaders or locals about the impact that such development would have on the sacred historical site. A grassroots movement quickly took shape and launched a campaign to Save Kituwah. Tribal leader from both the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as well as the Cherokee Nation and United Keetoowah Band all spoke out in opposition to the substation proposed site. The situation was widely reported and followed by the media throughout the country. Finally in early August of 2010, Duke Energy announced that they would move the planned substation to a new site away from Kituwah. The announcement marks a major victory for tribal community rights, cultural preservation, and grassroots political movements.

Today you can view the village site and mound either from the highway or the walking and bird watching trail that leads by the mound and to the river. The trailhead coordinates to this listing were taken at the parking area along the highway at the entrance near the information sign placed by the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. The mound is enclosed by a picket fence, and only should be viewed from outside of the fence. There is a trail that enters from the East side of the mound and leads to the center to a small patch of red Earth, which is there for cultural purposes in the rebuilding of the mound.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At an altitude of 4,522 feet, in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, stands a most singular and significant monument to Freemasonry.  The Masonic Shrine or Marker, is a tribute to the universality of Masonry that should be viewed by all.

Located near Black Camp Gap, it is 17 miles from Waynesville, North Carolina, and is reached by taking Route 19 South through Lake Junaluska and Maggie Valley to Soco Gap and the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Head south on the Parkway toward Cherokee, and turn right onto the side road to Heintooga Overlook.  The Marker, which is accessed by a short paved walkway from a parking area, is identified with a plaque by the roadside.

Through the efforts of Right Illustrious Companion T. Troy Wyche, Companion J. R. Boyd contributed one and one-half acres of land to the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of North Carolina during the Cryptic Year 1936-37.  At the 1937 Summer Assembly of York Rite Masons, a copper box, hermetically sealed and containing dated and Masonic memorabilia of that era, was locked into a black walnut box, and buried in a concrete vault at the Black Camp Gap property.  (In 1972, the box was unearthed, and the contents removed and placed in a display in Waynesville Masonic Lodge.  A new container, with items of that era, was placed back in the vault).  Companion T. Troy Wyche was already laying plans to mark the spot, and contacted Masonic Lodges, Grand Lodges, Grand York Rite Bodies, Scottish Rite Bodies, and any individuals of Masonic organizations interested in sending stones to be incorporated in the building of the monument.

From the proceedings of the Grand Council's Annual Assembly in Greensboro, North Carolina, on May 10th, 1938:  &quot;To mark the spot where the Grand Council last year buried its Memorial Deposit, we conceive the idea of a Masonic Marker as a true symbol of the universality of Masonry, and therefore have requested Masons of all countries and states to contribute stones to go therein.  Interesting stones have come from five continents, the isles of the seven seas, and from historic spots of nearly every state in the Union.  The idea has caused manifestation of great interest in the United States and among (Masons in) foreign countries, and consciousness that Freemasonry does have a message for this troubled world.&quot;  (This was at a time when war clouds were gathering over Europe and we were destined to involvement in World War II.)

Work of constructing the Marker was under the supervision of a non-Mason, Oscar L. Briggs, Supt. of the Water Department in Waynesville, North Carolina.  The city contributed the labor and the trucks for hauling the materials to the site.  M.I. Companion Wyche compiled a catalog showing the location and giving a history and description of each stone.  The completed marker was unveiled and consecrated at the Summer Assembly on July 11th, 1938.  It was estimated that this was the largest group of Cryptic Masons, (over 600) ever to meet outside the General Grand Council.  There were ten Illustrious Grand Masters present, distinguished Masons from 21 states, Canada, Cuba, and the Canal Zone.  After preliminary ceremonies at the Masonic Temple in Waynesville, the group journeyed to Black Camp Gap for the unveiling and dedication.  Rt. Wor. Companion Thomas J. Harkins, Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina, made the dedication address.

T. Troy Wyche passed through the Ninth Arch and to his just reward on April 26, 1939.  That summer, the Grand Council voted to have an appropriate marker erected in his memory at the Shrine site at Black Camp Gap.

In 1941, M.I. Claude B. Hosaflook, then a Provincial Grand Master of the Grand Council, conceived a plan for a series of 3, 5, 7, and 9 steps and five landings leading up to the Marker.  These were cut from Georgia gray granite and taken to the site in the Fall of that year.  However, World War II delayed completion and dedication until September 1948.  The riser of each step bears the inscription of each donor.

In 1949, the Blue Ridge Parkway took over the land on three sides of the Marker from the Boyd heirs, the Great Smoky Mountain National Park owning the remaining side.

Contained in construction of the Marker are 687 separate items or memorial pieces, consisting of various types of stones, granite, quartz, marble, slate, jade, onyx, tile, brick, crystal, gypsum, fluorspar, agate, garnet, fossil stone, and petrified wood.  The stones are reported to vary in weight from one ounce to a 170-pound stone from a Cuban fortress constructed by Don Hernando DeSoto in the 1500's.

The Marker was not destined to contain the Memorial Chest, since it remained buried in its concrete vault. It is alleged that the plans for the monument were drawn by Companion Wyche, it being 12 feet high and 9 feet square at the base.

As a protection against vandalism, an iron fence was erected around the Marker in 1954.  Due to some deterioration from the weather, a wooden covering was constructed through Grand Council efforts around 1978.

Of primary significance was the enthusiasm and cooperation of Masonic Bodies throughout the world in contributing to the Shrine Freemasonry's belief in the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man is more appreciated when viewing the tranquil and scenic setting of the Marker.  The universality of our great Fraternity was truly was truly demonstrated in a tangible manner, but let us not forget that all of the stones contributed would be nothing more than a pile of rubble were it not for the cement that binds them together.  It is the responsibility of each member of the Craft to make certain that the cement of Brotherly Love and Affection continues to hold us together as Masons, as Brothers, and as the children of God.

Native American Trail trees are trees that were modified by the American Aboriginal peoples in order to signify trails, campsites, or special locations (water supply, food, safety, etc.). Often these were oak saplings that are given a unique bend, usually pointed in the direction of the point of interest. This trail tree located near the Beech Gap trail head in the Blue Ridge of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park, not far from the Big Cove area of the Qualla Indian Boundary. This Cherokee Trail tree points the way up Laurel Fork Creek to the summit of Mount Guyot, and the trail to Balsm Mountain and Hientooga.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No this isn't Ebright Azimuth, It's a new series of caches exploring America's highest points. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, there will be no useless trivia, just the facts ma'am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 

Ebright Aziuth is the highest point in Deleware at 447ft above sea level. It is marked with a geodetic benchmark monument and has an elevation of 447.85 feet above sea level. The only state high-point with a lower elevation is Britton Hill in the state of Florida at 345 feet above sea level. The Ebright Azimuth is located about 6.5 miles north of downtown Wilmington, Delaware, in far northern New Castle County, within a few feet of the Pennsylvania state line. Contrary to what many people believe upon first impression, &quot;Ebright Azimuth&quot; is not a person's first and last name. James and Grant Ebright owned the property on which the benchmark was placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Britton Hill.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. It is manufactured by the Raytheon Company of the United States. The Patriot System replaced the Nike Hercules system as the U.S. Army's primary High to Medium Air Defense (HIMAD) system, and replaced the MIM-23 Hawk system as the U.S. Army's medium tactical air defense system. In addition to these roles, Patriot has been given the function of the U.S. Army's anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system, which is now Patriot's primary mission.

Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high performance radar systems. Patriot was developed at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, which had previously developed the Safeguard ABM system and its component Spartan and Sprint missiles. The symbol for Patriot is a drawing of a Revolutionary War-era Minuteman.

Between 1200 and 1500 AD Native American Indians were believed to have lived near the area of the McMahan Indian Mound. During excavation of the area in 1881, several artifacts were discovered including burials. Many of the artifacts were sent to the Smithsonian. The land was owned by the McMahan family at the time of the excavation &amp; thus the mound was named the McMahan Indian Mound. The mound measures 16 feet high and 240 feet in circuference.

Today the mound has a historic marker at the edge of the parkway. There is also a beautiful flower lined path that leads to a raised marker that indicates that the mound was conveyed to the city of Sevierville by the Temple family on December 28, 1987 &amp; that the site should not be disturbed due to its archeological &amp; historic signifance. 

It will only take a few moments to stop and view this historic site. It is a nice way to pay tribute to the Native Americans that once lived on this land and roamed this valley. 

To log this listing as a find, visit the site and locate a marker at the beginning of the sidewalk that leads to the plaque that tells about the mound being conveyed to the City of Sevierville by the Temple family. Enter in the code phrase (all caps) who the sidewalk is in memory of just as it is written.     </groundspeak:long_description>

Location,
Sevier County Court House. Sevierville, Tennessee.


The local country doctor, Dr. Robert F. Thomas, delivered Dolly on Jan. 19, 1946, near Locust Ridge, Tenn. (Sevier County). He was paid a sack of cornmeal for his work.

Sevierville claims the birth place of the famous Dolly Parton. Dolly came from a large family and is one of eleven children. Her first real break came when she performed at the Grand Ole Opry at the young age of 13. She was also featured on local radio stations. She then teamed up with Porter Wagoner to co-host his television show. This helped to bring her notoriety. Eventually, her musical career grew and she went out on her own, making several musical hits, her own television show, and starring in several big budget movies.

Dolly loves the Tennessee mountains and invested her time and energy into opening up a first class theme park featuring top country music artists, amusement rides, and musical reviews which she named Dollywood. It helped to shift the country music scene to Sevierville and several excellent country music clubs opened up which featured up and coming stars along with big name talent.
Dollywood, the theme park, is just up the road in Pigeon Forge, but we prefer this little celebrity landmark on the lawn of the Sevier County Courthouse. The statue is a life-size bronze, part of a 28-stop downtown walking tour of Dolly's hometown. Nearly everyone claims to know her personally. 

Under a shady tree, the figure by artist Jim Gray depicts the young, starry-eyed Dolly, barefoot, sitting on a rock with her guitar. 

To log this listing as a find, locate a granite monument on the ground to Dolly's left and post in the code phrase who it is dedicated to. Use the last three words on the monument in lower case in the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on the log.


The Lesser Known Facts

1) The only state that grows coffee

2) There is no racial or ethnic majorities here, everyone is a minority



Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in a Knoxville park, with over a half mile hike from the parking area, depending on which trail you take, (if) you stay on a trail. The cache is a thin ammo box about 170' off the nearest trail. 


This area has been developed into a Mtn. Bike/Hiking trail park by local volunteers and has a great trail system in it. Go here for trail map (http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~dunigan/mtnbike/icking.html ).
Its best to park at this location: N35 53.794 W083 57.108.
The trailhead is at the N.E. end of the parking lot along the lakeshore. After a rain, some sections of the trail will be muddy and the Park gate will be closed at night.
There is an active railroad track just North of the park. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO ON THE RR TRACKS. The trail goes a short distance along the lakeshore and then into the woods. There are numerous trails near the cache and this cache can be reached by boat when the lake levels are up.
There is an interesting site near this cache. </groundspeak:long_description>

The coords for parking are right in front of the trail but once you get on the trail and in the trees thats when the fun starts. I turned around multiple times and finally threw in the towel. This was my fist time ever locating a cache. I am now an addict. Lots of FUN.  I WILL BE BACK TO FIND this one. Most likely with help from a friend.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Although all that remains is the lower portion of the original 1819 30-foot-high blast furnace, it is actually a very small part of what was originally an entire complex known as the Newlee Iron Furnace. The furnace itself required considerable investment and was located here not by chance by because of the resources mentioned by Dr. Thomas Walker in 1750. The furnace itself was built 25 to 30 feet high with a hearth or a crucible where the molten iron was collected, perhaps a foot or two deep and three or four feet wide. Just above the hearth the opening flared outward and was termed the &quot;bosh.&quot; The bosh was about eight feet in diameter at its widest and narrowed as it converged toward the top. The outside of the furnace was built of sandstone with a liner of firebrick. Furnaces were usually built with an incline just behind to ease charging and loading. The trestle leading to the charging point was usually built of heavy planks with a track on it. Men, often slaves, would roll wheelbarrows of raw materials over this trestle and dump them into the top of the furnace.

To produce one ton of iron, the furnace required an exact recipe of 200 bushels of charcoal, 2 tons of iron ore, and 500 pounds of limestone, all of which would be lit and joined inside the furnace. A waterwheel-powered bellows kept the fires hot. It took 4 to 6 hours to produce molten iron, with a layer of slag floating on top. The slag would be drained off through the &quot;cinder hole,&quot; and then the molten iron would be drained through the &quot;tap hole&quot; below.

The slag would be added to the slag heap still visible in front of the furnace today, but the molten iron would be allowed to run down a narrow crevice in the sand into a corresponding and larger trench in the sand to cool into pig iron. The daily product of the Newlee Iron Furnace was 3¼ tons, at a cost of $19.40 per ton in 1877 figures. The iron made at Cumberland Gap was shipped down Powell River to Chattanooga. This furnace was the only furnace in the Dyestone belt still using charcoal in 1877.

This structure was used during the nineteenth century as a charcoal blast furnace for smelting iron. Probably built between 1813 and 1835 by Martin Beaty, it was operated intermittently until about 1881, by a number of people including John G. Newlee for whom the foundry was named at the end of the century. The foundry and buildings were used for ammunition storage for a part of the Civil War. This foundry is considered one of the last examples of a cold-blast charcoal furnace.  The furnace is located at the base of Cumberland Mountain, next to Gap Creek near Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, at an elevation of 1350 feet. In 1870, the foundry group consisted of the blast furnace itself, a 25' x 26', 35'-high limestone chimney lined with firebrick; a casting shed, a 15' x 20' single story frame building connected to the south; a 2 1/2-story, 30' x 45' storehouse to the north, with a 30' overshot water wheel to power the blast machinery; and a fleming mill detached from the complex nearby. Presently the site includes the 30' remains of the blast furnace, a grass-covered slag pile, a large stone with drill-holes for splitting it, and a portion of a flume, cut to channel Gap Creek around the foundry.

From the National Park sign at the furnace

&quot;From the early 1820s to the 1880s, an iron smelting business here took advantage of the rushing waters of Gap Creek. Today only the creek and part of the original 30-foot-high stone tower remain, a small part of an industrial complex of buildings, slag heaps, and machinery then called the Newlee Iron Frunace.

All the ingredients needed to make iron were nearby: iron-ore deposits close to the surface, limestone, abundant firewood to be made into charcoal for fuel, and waterpower to run the air bellows and a massive hammer mill. Some iron made here was sold to local blacksmiths. Some of the 150-pound ingots or 'pigs' were shipped down the Powell River to Chattanooga, Tennessee.

What It took every day to produce 3 tons of Iron was, 625 bushels of charcoal, 16.5 cords of wood (52 average size trees), 6 1/4 tons of Iron Ore, and 1,563 lbs Limestone.

A typical early-1800s ironworks needed a hammer mill and bellows next to the tower, as well as a way to continually dump charcoal and ore into the top of the chimney. For the Newlee Iron Furnace, the exact positions of these components are not known.

Frontier-era ironworks had an enormous appetite for firewood. During the 60 years iron was refined in this tower, more than 10 square miles of trees went up in smoke.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Native Americans were living in the Rose Hill area since the time of the earliest Native Americans, called the Paleoindians. Evidence of their presence here is a rare type of projectile point called a Clovis point. Clovis points have been found in nearby Ewing and Clovis points have reportedly been found in the eastern section of the Rose Hill district. This mound is a landmark along the Daniel Boone Trail, or Wilderness Road as it is still known today near another more well known landmark to the pioneers travling West, The White Rocks of the Cumberland.

Not all Native American groups traveled through western Lee County without staying. One group did build permanent structures and became residents. The Ely Mound is a well-known example. This mound, the best preserved mound in Virginia, is a special type of mound called a “temple mound”. It is the only temple mound known in the entire state of Virginia. 

You can see the Ely Mound across the four-lane from this location where the State Historical marker and a Daniel Boone Trail marker are located.

In June 1827, Rev. Abraham Still, Daniel Dickenson, George Morris, Evans Peery, Henry Thompson, Elkanah Wynn and James Woodward were appointed Trustees. The present Auditorium was built in 1827-28. The massive Oak columns were hewn by Henery Woodward and Rev. Loseph Haskew.

Cumberland Bowl Park is in the heart of Jonesville, at the end of Park Street just North of the center of town.  The &quot;bowl&quot; is a natural inclusion in the earth and a unique setting for the park itself.  Covering several acres there are many different areas for picnics, sports and a host of other activities.

One of the most untapped resources in Lee County, the park is open to one and all and almost all of the events within the park are free.  Included inside the park is one of the most intimate music venues in the area.  Several pavilions both large and small are available for gatherings such as family reunions.

Perhaps one of the greatest assets to the park is the &quot;Veterans Memorial Wall&quot;.  Soldiers names appear on the bricks of the wall honoring their service to Armed Forces of The United States of America.

Of Course the greatest thing about the park is it natural beauty.  Large Evergreens, and Oaks, along with many other of nature's best, thrive within the park's boundary.  It's quiet serenity is at times breath-taking.  Come for a quite walk, a picnic lunch or one of the many festive events.

This cache is located within the cemetery.  You will have to open the gate to enter.  Please close it when you leave.  There is plenty of parking nearby.  As long as the ground is dry you may drive back to the cemetery.  If ground is wet, park near the road and walk back.  Cemetery is located on private property and is in a pasture.  As long as property and cemetery are respected, the cache will remain.

 The South and North Ward Road Trails are actually easier/nicer than the Campground and Turkey run trails.  There is much less underbrush and there seemed to be fewer hills that had me get off the bike.  The South Ward trail offers super views of the lake the North some neat creeks and ravines.  There are some good maps available on the referenced webpage.  If anyone is interested I can email you a gpx file of my “track” that can be uploaded in a GPS.  There’s couple of places you can make a “wrong”  turn along the way (the connector to another trail and the access to the Brimstone Road trailhead.

There are several access points (I’ll be placing some caches near some)

Ward Road parking is here (Parking for 10 cars): N39 31.369 W83 58.664

 The South and North Ward Road Trails are actually easier/nicer than the Campground and Turkey run trails.  There is much less underbrush and there seemed to be fewer hills that had me get off the bike.  The South Ward trail offers super views of the lake the North some neat creeks and ravines.  There are some good maps available on the referenced webpage.  If anyone is interested I can email you a gpx file of my “track” that can be uploaded in a GPS.  There’s couple of places you can make a “wrong”  turn along the way (the connector to another trail and the access to the Brimstone Road trailhead.

There are several access points (I’ll be placing some caches near some)

Ward Road parking is here (Parking for 10 cars): N39 31.369 W83 58.664
There is access from Brimstone Road here (parking for 1 car): N39 30.519 W83 58.166

 The cache is located on the Caesar Creek Park Harveysburg mountain bike trail.  The easiest parking is at:

N39 30.857 W83 59.376

But the trail does connect with the South Ward Road trail.

This trail is quite nice.  Little undergrowth and most of the steep hills and drops are short – except one.  On the map you will see a little blue bypass.  And on the trail you will see a sign that says “easy” and “expert”.  I tried the expert and got half way up the other side before I fell off the bike!  Expert is no exaggeration!  [:D]

You can download a gpx file of the “track” from my trip.  There is a connector between the two sides of the trail I did not map.

 The South and North Ward Road Trails are actually easier/nicer than the Campground and Turkey run trails.  There is much less underbrush and there seemed to be fewer hills that had me get off the bike.  The South Ward trail offers super views of the lake the North some neat creeks and ravines.  There are some good maps available on the referenced webpage.  If anyone is interested I can email you a gpx file of my “track” that can be uploaded in a GPS.  There’s couple of places you can make a “wrong”  turn along the way (the connector to another trail and the access to the Brimstone Road trailhead.

There are several access points (I’ll be placing some caches near some)

Ward Road parking is here (Parking for 10 cars): N39 31.369 W83 58.664

We were working on The Bernoulli Ultimatum - A Green Cell Mission and were on our way to one of the stages. So far we'd been successful.  Low and behold, we run into ghs.  We talked for a little while and he gave us the coordinates for this cache.  I had loaded some of the other new ones in my GPS, but somehow missed this one.  We DNFd the next stage of the Bernoulli Untimatum so rather than leave the park completely downtrodden, we made our way over to the coordinates provided by ghs and got ourselves a smiley.  So all in all, it turned out to be a good day after all. We'll be back to finish the other one soon.  This was our 100th Find in the State of Ohio. TFTC!

I decided to try to grab some of the caches on the other trail.  So I headed for the Smokies.  Got about 1/4 mile down the trail and ran into water again. (See photograph).  I figured it was time to start bushwhacking.  That proved to be a good choice.  Note: There aren't too many briers/thorns in this area.  Made it to the cache okay and it was in great shape.  I took a TB from the cache to move along.  Thanks for placing this cache.  I'm looking forward to coming back for the rest once the water recedes.</groundspeak:text>

 The cache is located on the Caesar Creek Park Harveysburg mountain bike trail.  The easiest parking is at:

N39 30.857 W83 59.376

But the trail does connect with the South Ward Road trail.

This trail is quite nice.  Little undergrowth and most of the steep hills and drops are short – except one.  On the map you will see a little blue bypass.  And on the trail you will see a sign that says “easy” and “expert”.  I tried the expert and got half way up the other side before I fell off the bike!  Expert is no exaggeration!  [:D]

You can download a gpx file of the “track” from my trip.  There is a connector between the two sides of the trail I did not map.

 The cache is located on the Caesar Creek Turkey Run mountain bike trail.  The loop trail itself is about 2.4 miles ( a little shorter if you return the way you came).  I got to the Turkey Run trail head taking the western loop of the Campground mountain bike trail (the intersection is about 1.3 mile from the trail head near the parking at Center Rd. One website listed the Campground trail as “easy”, but lack of maintenance kicks it up a notch (huge tree across trail, collapsed bridge).

 The same website lists Turkey run as “easy” and that is flat out wrong.  There are about 6 hills so steep I had to push the bike up and walk down plus other technical challenges.  By foot or bike - expect a physical challenge!   There are some maps available online and if you wish you can email me and I’ll send you my “track”.  The Turkey Run trail has several intersections and a wrong turn is possible!

 If interested, you can email me and I can send you a gpx &quot;track&quot; file that can be uploaded to some GPS units.</groundspeak:long_description>

 I caught a lot of grief from the geocachers near East Fork Lake for hiding micros along the mountain bike trail.  Although I've hidden dozens of caches along other bike trails without any negative feedback before - the fact this trail was in the middle of the woods got people hankering for a big, meaty cache.  Since the customer is always right - I strapped on my backpack and hauled 3 regular size caches out here.  Some along the trail will still be smalls, but I hope they will all be satisfying...  So bring your swag!

The cache is located on the Caesar Creek Turkey Run mountain bike trail. The loop trail itself is about 2.4 miles ( a little shorter if you return the way you came). I got to the Turkey Run trail head taking the western loop of the Campground mountain bike trail (the intersection is about 1.3 mile from the trail head near the parking at Center Rd. One website listed the Campground trail as “easy”, but lack of maintenance kicks it up a notch (huge tree across trail, collapsed bridge).

The same website lists Turkey run as “easy” and that is flat out wrong. There are a couple  hills so steep I had to push the bike up and walk down plus other technical challenges on the way to this spot.  If interested, you can email me and I can send you a gpx &quot;track&quot; file that can be uploaded to some GPS units.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The South and North Ward Road Trails are actually easier/nicer than the Campground and Turkey run trails.  There is much less underbrush and there seemed to be fewer hills that had me get off the bike.  The South Ward trail offers super views of the lake the North some neat creeks and ravines.  There are some good maps available on the referenced webpage.  If anyone is interested I can email you a gpx file of my “track” that can be uploaded in a GPS.  There’s couple of places you can make a “wrong”  turn along the way (the connector to another trail and the access to the Brimstone Road trailhead.

There are several access points (I’ll be placing some caches near some)

Ward Road parking is here (Parking for 10 cars): N39 31.369 W83 58.664
There is access from Brimstone Road here (parking for 1 car): N39 30.519 W83 58.166
Where the South Ward trail intersects Ward road (no parking): N39 30.753 W83 58.092
Where to access the North Ward Road trail (no parking); N39 30.850 W83 58.302

As with the other paddle caches with one can be had by boat, wading, and in this case swimming (if the lake is high enough).  

Don't be misthaken, this isn't the East Cache-istan breakway province!  :-D

Difficult to hide anything hear, if it gets muggled I may need to camoflage better.

I would park at the lot outside the campground and come down the old boat ramp road.  It's paved all the way so you can ride a bike.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The cache is located on the Caesar Creek Turkey Run mountain bike
trail just shortly past where it intersects with the Campground
Trail. One website listed the Campground trail as
&quot;easy&quot;;, but lack of maintenance kicks it up a notch
(huge tree across trail, collapsed bridge). There's only 1 BIG hill
from the Campground trail to the cache.

 Every time I see a small region like this I recall those ads from the 1970's where they claimed you could buy land in someplace like North Dakota and (by some supposed loop hole) declare your own sovereign nation.  (Some sort of tax scam.)

Well, while you are on the island, feel free to declare yourself sole ruler of Cache-istan:  Land of the caches!  Feel free to pass allow any laws in your log for the next immigrants.

Please rehide well, there are many boaters who stop off here.

I put in at the campground boat launch NE of GZ.  There is another boat launch SW of the GZ but it wasn't open this spring.

(I see may logs with people invading on land from Cache-istan.  My suggestion is an amphibious landing!) 

 (Please rehide well, there are many boaters who stop off here.

I put in at the campground boat launch NE of GZ. There is another boat launch SW of the GZ but it wasn't open this spring.  The FTF invaders of Cache-istan put it off Ward Road (think Bernoulli Ultimatum) location.)

The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

If you're familiar with a matchstick container, you'll know what to look for.  The cache is located at Miami Valley Memory Garden, just outside Beavercreek, OH.  This location offers one of the best views of the Beaver Valley between Beavercreek and Xenia, OH.  Parking is available near the cache location.  Please re-hide the container as good or better than you found it so that the next cacher can enjoy the experience as much as you did and to avoid theft of the container by potential muggles.  Bring your own pen.

Typical hide in a cemetery. Most of the people in this cemetery lived and died in the 1800's. It's interesting to walk around and look at the older stones. I thought it was appropriate to pay my respects to the soldiers since tomorrow, May 31, 2010, is Memorial Day.

(European Black Pine)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinus nigra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young trees have yellowish-brown
bark, but this darkens as the tree grows. Old trees have
distinctive, furrowed bark colored with patches of brown, white and
gray. The Austrian Pine often is confused with our native Red
Pine, but the latter has reddish-brown bark as well as other
distinctive traits. The Austrian Pine is native to central and
southern Europe, and Asia Minor. Originally introduced from Europe
in the mid-1700s, this fast growing pine is widely planted as an
ornamental. It is easily established and tolerates city conditions
better than most other kinds of pine trees. In Ohio, landscape
workers commonly plant this tree in parks. Also, it is found in
some of our state forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is your basic magnetic bridge hide. You can park along the side of the bridge on the road. There is plenty of room.

My family and friends won't go anywhere with me because they know I will NEED to stop and cache along the way. I don't see anything wrong with that? Do you?

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our second “BoC” cache. BoC stands for Best of
Columbus and these caches will be placed throughout the city in
areas that we frequent and adore. This particular location has
rapidly become perhaps our favorite place in the city to walk
around and explore with our geodog Sam. Cache is available between
the hours of 7AM and 5PM, 7AM to 7PM during daylight savings time.
Make sure you are out by the posted hours because they do lock the
gates&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most prominent names in Columbus history can be
found interred here, as well as several governors and veterans of
nearly all American wars. Green Lawn Cemetery also boasts 360 acres
of trees, birds, and foraging woodland animals. The bridge near the
cache site was built in 1898 and is one of the best areas in the
cemetery for bird watching - over 200 species of birds have been
documented within the confines of the cemetery. You could literally
spend an entire day exploring the grounds and discovering hundreds
of unique headstones. While this cache is only one of two currently
hidden here, its enormity could easily support several more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located off the Nature Path and you can find the
entrance to the path near the intersection of Section 31 and the
giant boulder. There are also a few signs posted along the drive
that will direct you to the Nature Path. There are no headstones in
this area although you will need to exercise care when ascending
the slight embankment, hence the slight increase in difficulty.
Please remember to respect the residents if you do choose to
explore other areas after finding the cache. Remember to BYOP as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your geopooch and enjoy the walking trail. More
information about Green Lawn Cemetery can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenlawncolumbus.org&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;This Multi

Use Caution, and as much stealth as possible when hunting this
cache.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">  Greetings Tree People!
&lt;p&gt;This Tree ID Cache is a little
different than previous efforts, in that you are getting two for
the price of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is This a Multi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to acces the
&lt;strong&gt;Honey Locust&lt;/strong&gt; without being punctured by it's
infamous thorns, is to utilize the winding ladder of a &lt;strong&gt;Red
Mulberry&lt;/strong&gt; Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in
Hiltonia Park, where muggle activity, at times, approaches the
extreme. The cache placement is right where you should expect a
Tree ID cache to be, so be stealthy, and stay healthy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring Your Own Writing

Mulberry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morus rubra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 45-foot tall specimen of the Red
Mulberry was recorded in Franklin County in 1986. At that time, it
had a crown spread of 74 feet. The bark of this tree is dark brown,
often furrowed into thin plates, and frequently peels off in long
flakes. The Red Mulberry grows well in rich, moist soil, and
usually is found in hardwood forests of bottomlands and foothills.
Of the mulberry trees included in this program this is the only one
that is native to North America. It grows throughout most of the
eastern United States, except for the most northern parts, and
westward to Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The Red Mulberry is
widespread in Ohio, but is infrequent in the north-central part of
the state. The wood of this tree is soft but tough, and is very
durable when in contact with the soil. People use the wood in
making furniture, fence posts and tools. The berries are edible and
widely desirable, and a long line forms for them every year in the
late spring: people, livestock, many kinds of birds, various other
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not the tallest in Ohio,
this medium to large-size tree can develop a very large trunk. The
largest trunk in Ohio today (in Perry County) is a little more than
6 feet in diameter, while only 76 feet tall. The branches often but
not always have distinctive, branching thorns, not found on other
trees that are native to North America. The leathery seed pod grows
to 1 to 1.5 feet in length. This tree grows on rich, moist
bottomlands, slopes, and meadows. It is found throughout Ohio,
being especially abundant in the southwestern part of the state.
The wood is hard, strong, and durable, and is used for posts,
rails, railroad ties, and sometimes in general construction.
Honeybees feed on nectar from the inconspicuous flowers. Cattle
relish the seed pods, and the seeds are eaten by some
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;White
Oak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quercus alba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the largest trees of
forests in the eastern United States. The tallest known in Ohio
today is an 84-foot tree in Mahoning County. The distinctive bark
is light ash-gray in color, and often fissured into scaly plates.
The tree grows best on deep, well-drained upland soils. Still, it
is found in a wide variety of habitats throughout Ohio, probably
occurring in every county. The close-grained, strong wood is one
our best for furniture and hardwood flooring. Native American
Indians made flour from its acorns. Both Indians and early settlers
boiled the acorns to make them more palatable. Many kinds of
wildlife feed on the acorns as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br/&gt;
 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Sunset Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally established as Memorial Burial Park in 1922. There
are no published records of this cemetery. It is a large,
active,and growing cemetery west of Columbus. Situated on 131
acres, replete with beautiful trees, landscaping and gentle hills.
The cemetery features 25 gardens and flush to-the-ground or upright
monuments. There several war monuments throughout the grounds, and
large numbers of veterans from almost all wars of the last 100
years buried here. There are over 20 marked sections in this
cemetery, with paved roads throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunset Cemetery is located on SR-40 at 6959 West Broad Street,
Galloway, OH 43119-9391. You can access this cache by taking I-270
to the West Broad Street exit. It is approximately 3.5 miles (6
minutes) west of the freeway. The cache is in Section 14 of the
cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;b&gt;CAN NOT DO THIS CACHE AT NIGHT&lt;/b&gt; because the cemetery
is gated and monitored. Bring a pen or pencil because this cache
holds the log only. The coordinates take you to the cache location.
If you see a pole with a siren on it, and the cord dangling in the
breeze, you are close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you find the camo taped lock-n-lock letterbox at the base
of a tree nearby, it is not this cache and your log may be
deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;This is a
3 stage Multi Cache that will keep you inside of Westgate
Park.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This Cache
Was placed with permission from the Columbus Department of
Recreation and Parks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please
obey the rules and regulations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What you
are looking for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 larger
micros lead to a lock and lock at stage 3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;(
muggle activity here is
extreme) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was such a fun cache to place. djstitan5,
LavaBallz, and drainhook walked around the park for several hours
looking for the most inviting of spots to place these stages. 
Each stage poses a different type of physical challenge for you,
the more intrepid geocachers to
enjoy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We Look
Forward to reading your feedback&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be
Careful when opening the stage 1 container as not to break it's
contents. Everything is tied together inside, to prevent
droppage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several great items for the ftf to
choose from. including:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

BY ONE.&lt;br/&gt;
PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br/&gt;
PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sunset Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally established as Memorial Burial Park in 1922. There
are no published records of this cemetery. It is a large, active,
and growing cemetery west of Columbus. Situated on 131 acres,
replete with beautiful trees, landscaping and gentle hills. The
cemetery features 25 gardens and flush to-the-ground or upright
monuments. There several war monuments throughout the grounds, and
large numbers of veterans from almost all wars of the last 100
years buried here. There are over 20 marked sections in this
cemetery, with paved roads throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunset Cemetery is located on SR-40 at 6959 West Broad Street,
Galloway, OH 43119-9391. You can access this cache by taking I-270
to the West Broad Street exit. It is approximately 3.5 miles (6
minutes) west of the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a small lock-n-lock container with some small trade
items and a log. You &lt;b&gt;CAN NOT DO THIS CACHE AT NIGHT&lt;/b&gt; because
the cemetery is gated and monitored. Bring a pen or pencil, because
the pencil in the cache may go missing. The coordinates take you to
the cache location. Make sure you place the cache back in the
original location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Leaf
Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broad,
flat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;palmately
lobed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notches too
shallow to be very apparent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fruit
Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other fruit (not
cone, winged, acorn, or in pod or capsule)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tightly packed
seeds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seeds in capsules,
packed in non-burlike balls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dry, single seed
balls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sycamore&lt;br/&gt;
(American Sycamore)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platanus
occidentalis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not the tallest, this
probably is the largest in diameter of trees in the eastern United
States. The record holder in Ohio today has a diameter of more than
15 feet and a circumference of 48.5 feet. It probably would require
at least 8 grown persons, holding each others' hands, to reach
around this massive tree. This giant is 129 feet tall and grows in
Ashland County. In keeping with its size, Sycamores have the
largest leaves of any native tree in North America. Frequently, the
trunk of a Sycamore will be divided into several large, secondary
trunks. The bark of the Sycamore perhaps is its most striking
feature: mottled creamy white and brown with the darker bark of
older trees peeling away from the lighter-colored, younger bark.
Typically, the Sycamore grows on bottomlands, floodplains, and on
the banks of streams. It grows throughout Ohio. The tough,
coarse-grained wood is difficult to split and work. It has various
uses, including butchers' blocks. A few birds feed on the fruit,
and several mammals eat twigs and bark. The related Oriental and

London Planetrees are ornamental shade trees, frequently
planted along streets. They can be distinguished from the Sycamore
by the fruit: usually borne singly on long stalks on the Sycamore,
but in strings of 2 to 4 on the Planetrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree
Size&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
     height 80' - 100+'&lt;br/&gt;
     diameter 3' - 8'
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
Sycamore is one of my favorite Ohio Trees,  especially when
one is found leaning over a river, or a creek.  This one is a
vertical example, that stands alone in a field.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be safe, and enjoy your
climb!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF Congratulations to

&lt;p&gt; This cache is listed as a 5
terrain. However, there may be some of you that would be tempted to
try this without special equpment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly
advise you to think otherwise, to avoid injury to yourself, and to
the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container

Cottonwood)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Populus
deltoides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest of the
North American poplar trees. Ohio's largest example, 139 feet tall
with a diameter of more than 8 feet, grows in Medina County. The
tree's large, broadly triangular leaves are from 3 to 6 inches
long, and nearly as wide. Although the Eastern Cottonwood typically
grows on the moist soils of stream bottoms, swamps and lake shores,
it can grow well on dry soil. Also, unlike most trees, it can
survive long periods partial flooding. This tree is widespread and
common in Ohio. The wood is soft, light and weak. Its use mainly is
for rough construction and wood pulp. A related tree, the Swamp
Cottonwood, is found in a few parts of Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This particular specimen that holds
the cache is but an adolescent. Unfortunately, you will not have to
climb anywhere near 100' to retrieve the cache!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

visit to her little playground by the creek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Peanut's Playground)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Well Guess What??

&lt;p&gt;I have
another Dog…&lt;/p&gt;


His name is Dozer
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Unlike
Peanut, Dozer is a maniac, who’s limits are yet to be
discovered. He lacks grace, but boils over with playful energy. His
judgment is very poor, and he gets into things that Peanut never
would. He is absolutely, uncontrollably CRAZY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some
may even call him stupid…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;

You may have the same opinions about him (and me) if you
attempt his cache!
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain, He keeps you on your toes, and he is
a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be Prepared to Hike, Wade, Climb, Curse, and Climb some
more.&lt;/p&gt;
Just as I cannot imagine raising this goofy dog by my
lonesome, I strongly recommend bringing a partner along for this
one.
&lt;p&gt; I expect this Multi
Cache will be as much of a challenge as living with this ridiculous
dog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6
larger micros lead to a slightly larger Micro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Coordinates are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a Dangerous cache, attempt at your own
risk&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll say this, I vomitted twice while placing the final
stage.... well not really, but almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: All I ask is that The
Person Who Signs the Log, Logs The Find. If you are a &quot;tag-along&quot;
at the bottom of the final stage, feel free to post a note, but not
a &quot;FOUND IT&quot;.  This is serious physical, and mental
challenge.  Please respect my wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please
post as many photos as you'd like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smile!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(these dogs are not fighting, they are best of
buds, having a great time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Huge HighFive, Congratulations, and small reward
to ExTheFlow For this
treacherous FTF achievement!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Clover Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest stone recorded was erected in 1824. The Prairie
Township trustees care for the cemetery but right now it is in
horrible condition. For many years the cemetery was left totally
abandoned and neglected. There are many, many broken and unreadable
stones in this cemetery. Most of the gravestones have been knocked
over to the ground and broken. Several broken gravestones are
stacked inside a fenced-in area inside the cemetery. At the main
gate is a cross which has been toppled with a plaque that
reads:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &quot;In memory of five unknown Veterans buried in these hallowed
grounds. Let no man plow it under.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
—Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6065, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clover Cemetery is located on the west side of Alton-Darby Creek
Road, just under a mile north of Broad Street (US 40) and about a
half mile north of Alton Cemetery (GC1JA72). There is no road sign
for this cemetery and it barely seen from Alton-Darby Creek Road,.
Access is from a dirt road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a micro container with log only where you will need
to &lt;b&gt;bring your own pen or pencil&lt;/b&gt;. This is not located inside
the cemetery gates. Please do not go into the cemetery to try to
find this cache. Be aware of muggle activity with large apartment
buildings nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide the container out of sight ~~~~~~~~ Congrats to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; These caches are
hidden on a 40 acre plot of land designated as green space for
community use. This wild area is a well kept secret and is
generally only frequented by the residents of the adjacent
subdivision, Lake Darby Estates. This woodland floodplain is rich
with native natural beauty and
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately, there are several residents who consider this area
to be their personal ATV course, and inflict much destruction on
the floodplain with their vehicles, and other unsavory
activities.  So please bring along a trash bag, and help us
keep this area as clean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is to bring Eco
Friendly geocachers to this area to adventure, and raise awareness
of the precarious state of our beloved watershed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Peanut and I have been
working on this multi for a couple of weeks now, and want to share
a great adventure with the more intrepid geocachers in the
area.  This course will take some time, and test your skills,
so please come down to the creek, you may even get to play with Peanut...
if you're lucky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN HUNTING THESE
CACHES.  IF YOU THINK YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT THE CACHE
BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT, COME BACK WITH HELP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hook, I cannot thank you ENOUGH for taking time out of your morning before the WWFM VI event to come and put those waders on to take some amazing pictures for us.  It was so good to finally meet you, Peanut, and share our Darby stories.  No doubt we will be seeing each other out there again soon.

It was such a perfect day to try the often talked about, scary but well revered Peanut's Playground.  The weather could not have been better, and the water was low.  Funny how we have fished on these islands over the years and never thought something could someday be looming overhead [:D]  We got to do some quality creekstompin with some really good friends.  TeamGuisinger, Bartholic and ourselves of the original &quot;Clever Cachers&quot; group. Chaseur, Timeage, and Lil Viv and all the kids of each cacher group. It was quite a gang down there today.

Stage 1 and stage 2 were knocked out fairly quickly.  Stage 3 gets a little harder, but when you have a 9 year old with rubber boots on that climbs like a professional, you can't go wrong!!  AWESOME JOB!

JB creekstomper actually tried stage 4, but after breaking a branch off decided that if he were to go any higher, he might break more limbs and compromise the cache for future attempts.  So he came down and Mr. TeamG Josh made it look so easy. 

Stage 5 was the final reward, and a very nice one.  Well stocked and what a fine view you have here!

We were proud to sign the log, share the day with some great folks, and to say TFTC!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have had 4 months to the day to think about the last visit. After getting with a few feet of stage 4 I was GOING to make it up the tree this time. Out today with TeamBobcats, Kihap, TeamMonroes, Escondidas, and Trybble1 and Miketr90. I had the luxury of watching the other grab the first 3 stages and keep myself from thinking about the inevitable climb at stage 4.The 2 venti cups of Starbucks had me kinda wired so I was hoping I could just jump to the limb containing the cache. After a few others made the climb I finally had to go. It wasnt as bad as I remember and was able to make the touch on stage 4!!! WAHOOO. 

Escondidas made the trip up the same way I went up the last visit. Congrats to him for getting farther than I did. 

Thanks to Drainhook and Peanut for this great cache. It has been many many years since I have climbed trees and well I hope it is many more before the next time. ;)

This is a fairly simple cache at one of the downtown parks in
Columbus which opened in the Spring of 2005. North Bank park is
situated on the north bank of the Scioto River south of Spring
Street at the intersection of Neil Avenue. There is meter parking
available on Spring Street. Posted hours are 7:00am until 11:00 pm,
although this one would be a great night cache if you are there
before closing time.

&lt;b&gt;Please be sure to re-hide EXACLTY where you find! There is a
place that will protect it from the rain and a place that will keep
it exposed.&lt;/b&gt; The location aids in its ability to withstand the
elements. 
&lt;p&gt;Kids should love this park since there are jumping fountains for
them to run through. There are also many tables, so bring a lunch
and enjoy some of the spectacular views of the downtown
skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a log sheet inside, but there is no room for trade
items. There is no room for a writing utensil so please make sure
you bring one to log your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ftf
Honors to brtruitt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people like to play tennis, golf, or
even scuba dive.  Most of you know by now that I love to climb
trees.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; Well, when I am Not Climbing Trees, I
love to fish moving water.  There is nothing like twitching a
bait on the surface of a river, with the intent of tricking a
Smallmouth Bass into Taking The Bait.  These fish are
voracious fighters, that literally Fly out of the water during the
heat of battle.  These photos of flying fish were taken by my
lovely wife while I was in mid fight with my favorite species of
fish. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This transitional time of year,
when the water gets cooler, bordering on cold, is my favorite time
to fish with Live Bait. The Smallmouth huddle together in the
deepest pools they can find, vying for prime positions to ambush
unsuspecting schools of
baitfish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The first step in this
p&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rocess is to catch some
bait.  I like to catch bait in the same stream that I will be
fishing as to present the most natural bait possible (what the
smallmouth are already accustomed to hunting).  I utilize a
cast-net, to catch as many of these nice plump Shiners, or Northern
Stonerollers as possible, as&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ese are some of the
Smallmouth's favorite treats.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In the warmer months, Peanut
and I like to wade the streams, pitching artificial baits, and
lures, stalking feeding smallmouth for hours at a time. I also take
great pleasure in hunting BIG catfish during the summer
months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This stretch of creek that you will be
experiencing is a great place to catch some lively Smallmouth
Bass.  Along with your fishing gear, please bring a trash bag
and help me clean up after some not so conscientious fisherpeople
who frequent the area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh yeah, about the
cache - The hint is for one of the middle stages, maybe stage 4, or
5, I forget.  The terrain throughout this adventure can be
very tricky at times. Pay attention to recent rainfall, and water
levels, to know what you may be getting into, rather, HOW MUCH you
will be getting into.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Practice Catch &amp;
Release!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This year, 2010, I've already gotten poison ivy two times so I thought I should do some research. Please check the link included for pictures throughout the season of the changes in the leaves of poison ivy. 
You can almost count on poison ivy growing at the edge of every field within its range. And at the edge of every road, and the edge of every forest. And wherever man has bulldozed a stable environment - like a new shopping mall or a housing subdivision. In the open field the grass usually wins over time, and in the deep woods the ivy probably can't get enough light. But at the edge of the field, forest, parking lot, or road - the poison ivy wins out.

I saw this one publish during the middle of my work day. When I read the name I was immediately interested, as I consider Big Darby to be &quot;My Stream&quot;. I spend a lot of time on this creek, and cherish the solitude, and adventure it offers me.

I then looked at the cache page, during my break, and saw that this was at one of my most frequented paddle put-ins (and Very near where I have been planning on placing a cache!) So I had to stop after work, and check this one out. It was right where I thought it would be. This was the first cache that I found using only my iphone.

Thanks for the cache.

What is a haiku?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The
haiku originated in Japan and is a verse (poem) written in three
lines. The haiku does not have to rhyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The entire haiku is composed in 17 syllables. The first line
contains five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and
the third and final line has five syllables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5
    
did you bring a pen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
7   

no, I left it in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
5  
     

CRAP! I’ll go get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The haiku posted doesn’t have to conform to the traditional
haiku subject matter i.e. nature, or the changing of seasons.
Simply write one about anything as long as it keeps the 5 - 7
– 5 syllable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I encourage you to have fun, even post a photo, and add a haiku
accompaniment such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Lets embrace once more&lt;br/&gt;
Before Autumn's frigid breath&lt;br/&gt;
Sends us to our death.&lt;/strong&gt; 
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;first peeled off my
rind&lt;br/&gt;
now he stares at my behind&lt;br/&gt;
lest he would go blind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to brtruitt for the
FTF!  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Photos and
haiku not required, just encouraged&lt;/p&gt;

 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jonathan Alder History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Alder&lt;br/&gt;
First White Settler in Madison County (1773 -1849)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven-year-old Jonathan Alder was captured by a Native American
war party in Virginia in 1781 and taken to a Mingo village north of
the Mad River in Ohio where he was adopted by an Indian family. He
remained with the Indians until after the 1795 Treaty of Greenville
ended the Indian Wars in the Ohio Country. As white settlers
entered the region, Alder frequently served as an interpreter. In
1805, he journeyed to Virginia and was reunited with his original
family. He returned to Ohio with his new wife, Mary Blont, and
built a cabin on Big Darby Creek. His cabin is now at the Madison
County Historical Society Museum in London. Alder is buried in
Foster Chapel Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable historical graves from the mid-1800's timeframe
buried in this cemetery include the Beach, Bidwell and Harbage
families. Many stones date back to the mid to late 1800's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cemetery is located 1.1 miles north of Interstate 70. If
coming from the highway, you would exit at #85, West
Jefferson/Plain City going north. There is both re-entry to 70E/70W
from this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This traditional cache is placed in the Foster Chapel Cemetery.
Foster Chapel Cemetery is also known as Alder Chapel or the
Methodist Episcopal Cemetery. Please respect all cemetery rules
posted at the entrance of the driveway. Cemetery closes at dark,
and we absolutely do not recommend trying to find this one in the
dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container lid must be placed on correctly and screwed on well.
Please make sure it is sealed properly. Travel bugs and trackable
items are always welcome at this location! The container is large
enough to hold several large items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Original Contents included:&lt;br/&gt;
WV Totem Pole TB&lt;br/&gt;
The General Lee TB&lt;br/&gt;
Daisy's Jeep TB&lt;br/&gt;
among many other goodie geoswag items&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The coordinates take you to a
little clearing surrounded by trees, and the remnants of a
farmhouse. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;At
Ground Zero you will find a Mason Jar that was already present when
I placed the cache.  There are strange items in the
jar. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These items are of no
consequence, just a marker so you know that you are at the
right spot. &lt;br/&gt;
 Please leave this container where you found it, (it is NOT THE
CACHE) but feel free to place any other interesting items found at
the site, in the container - No Swag.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- OK -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; Stand next to this container and
look around. You will see 3 TREES, that are solid
options for a terrain challenge.  If you walk around
and look hard enough you will even see containers peering down at
you from each of these trees.  One of these trees holds the
the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which one contains the
log?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 None of these containers are &quot;easy&quot; to get to, but some are much
harder than their
counterparts.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will
you get lucky?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please
share in your logging how many

licks it takes for you to get to the center of this
cache.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Did you get lucky and choose the correct way first? Did you pick
the one that you thought was the easiest to get to, then realize it
was not the right one (Or vice versa)?  Did you Stand by the
jar, look around, and drive home with your tail between your legs,
and your finger on the ignore
button? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No spoilers in
the logging please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There
      will be a nice reward for the first to find, after the log is
      verified.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; OH Yeah, -
Bring &lt;strong&gt;a Pen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt; Attempt this cache at your
own risk, and do not cache beyond your limits. This cache is not
for little children, unless you are wanting to impress them with
your tree climbing abilities&lt;/p&gt;

Im a proud buckeye, and have taken part in the best tradition. Any buckeye knows that means beating Michigan. So with that being said I knew that a cache need to be set up for all buckeyes to share in. 

We recently Lost a legendary coach ( May 30, 2011). He won 7 big ten titles. 1 national championship and best of all, boasts a record of 9 wins 1 loss vs Michigan. The best record in OSU history. Truly a worthy coach. Name that coach. </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is a magnetic key holder. It holds the log book. Bring your own writing utensil for your find. We hope you will explore the inside of building during hockey season (the games are free to attend!)

Notions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat awhile on the
metal bench, allowing my thoughts to drift. Floating Notions
flurried through my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
These
waking dreams have focused intent, of weaving through the
stars.
&lt;p&gt;Mere
inches or feet of subtle ascent, unnoticed by passing
cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaxing
the laws of physics to bend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With
fear and trembling, end over end,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spin
wildy collapsing,  back to the bench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
taste of transcendence, a thirst I must quench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus...
Envision... Weightless... Adrift...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
shackles of gravity, Their hold starts to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further
now, I'm letting go, evading trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body,
and mind in flux, I've crossed the crux...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverting Constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
is the largest of the Ash trees in North America, sometimes
reaching 100 feet in height. The tallest specimen in Ohio today
reaches 85 feet, and almost is 6 feet in diameter. The firm, gray
bark of the White Ash has diamond-shaped furrows and interlacing
ridges. The tree grows in the rich, moist, well-drained soil of
bottomlands and not-so-dry slopes. It ranges throughout Ohio. The
size and value of White Ash trees make this one of the primary
commercial hardwoods in the United States. The wood is hard,
strong, elastic, and very useful. It has a variety of applications,
including interior finish, vehicles, furniture, containers, and
wooden equipment. Also, it often has been used as a shade or street
tree. Several kinds of birds eat the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

Along the way I remembered when I was here before there was a van parked right in front of the area I wanted to search with workers passing the time sitting inside the van on lunch break. This time, after dark, it was much easier to search. I'm going to have to do more of this night caching in order to find some caches. This was a great hide. Not what I was expecting at all.

After running around Dublin all day creekstompers took us to a few of their

HIDDEN BY ONE.&lt;br/&gt;
 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br/&gt;
 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wesley Chapel Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesley Chapel Cemetery was established in 1818, although the
first burial did not take place until 1835. It is still an active
cemetery. It is located beside the FORMER Wesley Chapel Methodist
Church. Please note that this is now a private residence, and no
longer a church. The oldest gravestones are located near the former
church. It is a beautiful, very well maintained cemetery with
several interesting, old gravestones with detailed carvings.

&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wesley Chapel Cemetery is located on Dublin Road, about one mile
south of Fishinger Road, in Hilliard, Ohio (Norwich Township,
Franklin County). Cache is best accessed from the road within the
cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
The cache is a small lock-n-lock with room for very small trading
items. You may need to &lt;b&gt;bring your own pen or pencil&lt;/b&gt;. Please
respect all cemetery rules posted at the entrance of the driveway.
Cemetery is open Dawn to Dusk, and we absolutely do not recommend
trying to find this one after dark due to the housing developments
which border the cemetery and people who will see you in the
dark.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide the container out of sight ~~~~~~~~ Congrats to

You can also park along Dodridge in an entrance area but the gate is never open on this side of the cemetery. It is actually easier to find if you park on Dodridge at this entrance. Dodrige is closed for repairs to the bridge but you can enter Dodridge from Olentangy River Rd. Container is a small plastic gum containter. Good luck.  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the third cache in a series called &lt;b&gt;&quot;PAF&quot; -- or Phone
A Friend&lt;/b&gt; series. You will be tempted to phone a friend, but
sometimes that may just be for moral support when you find our
cache is not as easy as you think. Or it may be that you will need
to phone a friend because you tried to get some information from
them, but now it isn't working out for you. So there's plenty of
reasons to phone a friend. But we're afraid this won't help you
this time no matter how hard you try, or at least that's &lt;b&gt;our
goal!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So far the series:&lt;br/&gt;
PAF #1 - Succession&lt;br/&gt;
PAF #2 - C&amp;O A800&lt;br/&gt;
PAF #3 - Surreptitious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a cache in Cross Creek Park. There is no need
to go near school property, and parking coordinates have been
provided so you may park along the road. Please abide by all rules
and regulations in posted signage for this common use field.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can use the sidewalk and walk .10 mi to the cache site from the
parking coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;
N 40° 01.202&lt;br/&gt;
W 83° 09.569&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Coordinates take you to the area you need to search. Muggles may be
present - driving by - or just in the area. Stealth is required.
Cache In Trash Out (CITO) efforts are appreciated here!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bring a pen. Re-hide the cache as it was found. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2QEQ0 - GC2QEQ0 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 01.202 W 083° 09.569 </groundspeak:long_description>

L.




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Populus alba&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;White Poplar&lt;/strong&gt;) is a species of poplar, most closely related to the aspens
(&lt;em&gt;Populus&lt;/em&gt; sect. &lt;em&gt;Populus&lt;/em&gt;). It is native from
Spain and Morocco
through central Europe (north to Germany
and Poland) to central Asia. It grows
in moist sites, often by watersides, in regions with hot summers
and cold to mild winters.[1][2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
White Poplar leaves; underside left, upper side right


&lt;br/&gt;
White Poplar trunk, showing the characteristic
diamond-shaped marks

&lt;p&gt;It is a medium-sized deciduous tree, growing
to heights of up to 16-27 m (rarely more), with a trunk up to 1 m
diameter and a broad rounded crown. The bark is smooth
and greenish-white to greyish-white with characteristic
diamond-shaped dark marks on young trees, becoming blackish and
fissured at the base of old trees. The young shoots are covered
with whitish-grey down, including the small buds. The leaves are
4-15 cm long, five-lobed, with a thick covering of white
scurfy down on both sides but thicker underneath; this layer wears
off the upper side but not the lower, which stays white until
autumn leaf fall. Larger, deeply lobed leaves are produced on
fast-growing young trees, and smaller, less deeply lobed leaves on
older, slow-growing trees. The flowers
are catkins up to 8 cm long, produced in early
spring; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on
separate trees; the male catkins are grey with conspicuous dark red
stamens, the female catkins are greyish-green. The female catkins
lengthen to 8–10 cm after pollination, with several
green seed capsules, maturing in late spring to early summer. It
also propagates by means of root
suckers growing from the lateral roots, often as far as 20-30 m
from the trunk, to form extensive clonal colonies.[2][3]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;White Poplar hybridises with the closely related
Common Aspen &lt;em&gt;Populus tremula&lt;/em&gt;; the resulting hybrid, known as &lt;strong&gt;Grey
Poplar&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Populus × canescens&lt;/em&gt;), is intermediate
between its parents, with a thin grey downy coating on the leaves,
which are also much less deeply lobed than White Poplar leaves. It
is a very vigorous tree with marked hybrid
vigour, reaching 40 m tall and over 1.5 m trunk diameter (much
larger than either of its parents). Most Grey Poplars in
cultivation are male, but female clones are occasionally
found.[2]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Cultivation and uses&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It requires abundant light and ample moisture,
and stands up well to flood water and slightly acidic soils. Its
green-and-white leaves makes it an effective ornamental tree but the
root suckers may cause problems in some situations. It is very
attractive as an open-grown tree in water meadows, and, because of
its extensive root system and tolerance of salt, is also planted to
strengthen coastal sand dunes.[4]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The majority of White Poplars in cultivation in
northern Europe are female trees.[3]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;White poplar was first introduced to North
America in 1748 and has a long history in cultivation.[1] It is now found in
forty-three states throughout the contiguous U.S.[2] It has come to be
considered weedy or invasive, and has been banned in
Connecticut.[3][4] US invasive state location
map&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It has been introduced into North America,
especially along the east coast. It is a highly competitive tree
and was the most common introduced tree species on Cape Breton Island.[5]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In intensive forest management it is being
replaced by various cottonwood hybrids. The wood is soft, and used to make
cellulose and for cheap boxes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A conical cultivar from Turkestan, &lt;em&gt;Populus alba&lt;/em&gt; 'Pyramidalis'
(Bolle's Poplar; syn. &lt;em&gt;Populus bolleana&lt;/em&gt;) is sometimes
planted in parks.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

to when there were no railroad bridges on Hilliard-Cemetery Road.
You will remember when these pine trees were planted during the
expansion of the road and the construction of the railroad bridge
which helped &quot;decongest&quot; the area. It's hard to believe today that
you had to wait at the tracks .... and not drive underneath
them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pines at the top of the embankment on each side of the road
are now standing tall, full grown and welcoming you into the city
from the freeway. This &quot;odd&quot; pine stands on the old Sutherland's
Lumberyard / current Life Community church side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to access this from the Life Community Church parking
lot. You CANNOT access this from Hilliard-Cemetery Road. Please
bring your own writing utensil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; From the
unfortunate demise of the nearby Osage Orange trees, This cache was
borne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Silver Maple&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Acer saccharinum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeply lobed leaves
are silvery on their under surfaces, a feature often noticeable
when leaves are blown by wind. The bark of older trees typically
separates into long, narrow scales, giving the trunks a &quot;shaggy&quot;
appearance. The tree commonly grows in moist and fertile habitats,
in swamps, stream banks, and bottomlands where flooding occurs. As
with the Red
Maple, Silver Maple wood is soft and neither strong nor
durable. Its uses generally are limited to cheap furniture,
pulpwood, containers, and as a fuel. Although relatively
short-lived, this fast-growing tree commonly is planted along
community streets and as a shade tree. An early writer claimed that
&quot;more tasty&quot; sugar could be gotten from this tree and the Red
Maple than from the 
Sugar Maple, but in much lower quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second in a series called &lt;b&gt;&quot;PAF&quot; -- or Phone A
Friend&lt;/b&gt; series. You will be tempted to phone a friend, but
sometimes that may just be for moral support when you find our
cache is not as easy as you think. Or it may be that you will need
to phone a friend because you tried to get some information from
them, but now it isn't working out for you. So there's plenty of
reasons to phone a friend. But we're afraid this won't help you
this time no matter how hard you try, or at least that's &lt;b&gt;our
goal!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So far the series:&lt;br/&gt;
PAF #1 - Succession&lt;br/&gt;
PAF #2 - C&amp;O A800&lt;br/&gt;
PAF #3 - Surreptitious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some History:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1929-30, wooden cabooses were common on American railroads,
as were wooden box cars and composite gondolas and hoppers, but
steel was quickly supplanting wooden cars everywhere. When both the
C&amp;O and Pere Marquette got new cabooses in 1937, they were
steel cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM A800-A824 were built by Magor Car Corporation and were
delivered in June 1930. They had rectangular marker lights mounted
permanently on the cupola sides in an unusual configuration.
Otherwise, by all measures both inside and out they were standard.
They weighed about 44,000 pounds, as compared with 41,500 for the
C&amp;O cars built at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the PM was merged into the C&amp;O in 1947, the cars were
relettered. They retained their original numbers until they were
retired sometime in the mid-1970s, when all wooden C&amp;O cabooses
were taken out of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Note: The coordinates take you to the caboose, from there you
are on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Many More Times, treat me the way you wanna do?&lt;br/&gt;
When I give you all my love, please, please be true.&lt;br/&gt;
I'll give you all I've got to give, GPS, PAF, and all.&lt;br/&gt;
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna
crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to touch/search any wood or wood objects on the
caboose. The cache is attractive for sure. When you find it -
&lt;b&gt;please put it BACK EXACTLY HOW YOU FOUND IT!&lt;/b&gt; You don't want
to give the next cacher a 5 difficulty now do you?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please use extreme stealth because there are police and firemen
nearby (substation). Acting may be required!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We do NOT recommend doing this one at night.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Muggles could be everywhere and access could be restricted at
times. Please find a place to park and walk to the cache. Avoid
blocking the road in front of the caboose.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If we see any damage done to this caboose, we will pull the listing
and archive it. Please be respectful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great place to bring your picnic lunch or dinner, your
family, your dog or just spend some time. Lots of historical things
to look at and usually a quiet place. Lots of mature trees for
shade!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Hilliard Business Complex. Follow the road to the end of the court
and park there. Enter the wooded area to your right across from the
old Fed Ex Shipping Terminal. The most direct looking path is not
the easiest. Take the obvious paths into this dense area, and your
GPS may bounce a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is fair amount trash, so bring a garbage bag (perfect
C.I.T.O opportunity). You will see the remains of the old farm
house and the silo which still stands tall in amazing shape. You
are looking for a medium sized camo'd lock-n-lock capable of
holding trade items and moderate sized trackables. Please bring
your own writing utensil.&lt;/p&gt;

HIDDEN BY ONE.&lt;br/&gt;
 PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ANY OF THE GRAVESTONES.&lt;br/&gt;
 PLEASE RESPECT THIS CEMETERY AND ALL OTHER CEMETERIES.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Big Darby Cemetery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Darby Cemetery is still an active cemetery. It is also known
as Big Darby Baptist Cemetery, and it's located behind the Baptist
Church. It's in fantastic shape, the grounds are very well taken
care of. There's also a very beautiful view of the surrounding
farms from the back of the cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Darby Cemetery is located on the east side of Plain
City-Georgesville Road, just north of Price-Hilliards Road, outside
Plain City, Ohio (Canaan Township, Madison County). You can access
this cache from I-70 E or W by going NORTH on SR 142 (Plain
City-Georgesville Road) approximately 4.5 miles. If coming from the
highway, you would exit at #85, West Jefferson/Plain City going
north. You will pass the Alder TB Hotel (GC1JWD6) on the way to
this cache from the freeway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cache Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT in the landscape island where you park.
Please do not disturb any landscaping.&lt;/b&gt; Cache is a small
lock-n-lock container with some small trade items and a log. We do
not recommend doing this cache at night, and the cemetery hours do
not support night caching. Bring a pen or pencil, because the
pencil in the cache may go missing. The coordinates take you to the
cache location. Make sure you place the cache back in original
condition - so that everything looks &quot;normal&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

After running around Dublin all day creekstompers took us to a few of their

This one should have been a bit tougher if it was where it was originally 
but we SL and put it back where it should be.

The first part of the cache, a micro, has the coordinates published above. When you find this micro, it will contain the coordinates to the second part-the one with the loot. There is no log in the micro, only a slip of paper with coordinates on it. The log is in the ammo can.

Please leave both parts of the cache EXACTLY as you found them so that others may enjoy this cache as well. We really don't see too much difficulty in this cache for the experienced, seasoned cacher. It may take some time for rookies, but we think it is a fun one. This is our first hide, so tell us what you think about the difficulty and terrain rating that we gave it. We just weren't sure.


Also, PLEASE-no spoilers or hints in the logs.

Enjoy!

Congrats to BrutusD on the FTF!!!


This is my first cache placed. I strongly urge you to block the cache site with your car. Most likely you have done a cache like this before around here. It will be easy to do this cache at night. You shouldn't need a flashlight if you come at night. One last thing I have a pencil nub in the cache but it could disappear. Also any logs containing a spoiler even encrypted spoilers will be deleted.Also you must sign the log to claim a find. Please post needs maintnance if its frozen.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This could prove to be a fairly difficult hike depending on your
approach. It is very rocky, so use caution. The cache is well
hidden, but you should be able to find it with a little looking
around. Also because of the nature of the area, it may be difficult
to maintain a signal.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When you enter the park, walk past the playground equipment, and
tennis courts, and take the paved bike path down. From there,
you're on your own.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This one was made more for the journey than the reward. I think
it's an interesting park, and something that I didn't expect to
find in Dublin. The cache is a small cache, so there's not much
room for swag. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The container is a decon container.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 A word of warning. I stopped out here to check up on the cache
just after a heavy rain. It gets very slick all around the area,
and there is a lot of standing water after a rain. So if you head
out there when, or just after it rains please be careful.</groundspeak:long_description>

Permission has been given by the Ohio State Parks for this geocache



This location was the spot where I placed my first Geocache back in 2002. After some time I believe it got washed away, and I archived it. I finally decided I needed to place another one here. The original location was about 100 feet from where the cache is today.


The cache was named because there is a Bald Eagle nest not too far away, and at the time it was the only one in Delaware County. I placed it here to highlight that, plus I wanted something with a challenging hike, and some decent views.

If you visit this cache you will find there are no real trails to get you to the cache. If you pay close attention you might be able to follow trails made by fisherpeople, and deer paths. You will very likely run into thorns, nettles, poison ivy, logs hidden in the underbrush, ticks, snakes and other critters.

Also be careful during the various hunting seasons. It might be a good idea to wear blaze orange during these times as this is a legal hunting area.

Parking can be found easily at two locations. The first is at the below dam area which gives you about a 3/4 mile, one way, hike. This area is located at N 40° 21.520 W 083° 04.325. This parking area closes at 9:30pm. The other location is located off of Panhandle Road. just north of the dike at N 40° 21.586 W 083° 03.251. This area, like the area of the cache is open until 11pm. This is a longer hike, but I've never measured it to see how far it is.

The Bald Eagle nest can be found by parking at the aforementioned spot on Panhandle Road, and walking east on top of the dike. The nest is located about 1/4 mile away in the top of a tree that stands pretty much alone on the south side of the dike. They don't always nest here, so you may not see anything. Also during certain times of the year, when they are more sensitive to people, the area will be off limits as marked by signs near the parking area.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not much of a hike, but about 3/4 of a mile paddle from the nearest
boat launch, if you head out in a straight line.

This one is only accessable by boat. It's probably easiest with a
canoe, kayak, rowboat, or other small craft. The water is normally
pretty smooth, and there aren't a lot of power boats out there, but
you would still want to keep an eye out. Per park regulations you
cannot swim to this one, and it's also off-limits if you're
thinking about waiting until the lake freezes. Boat rentals are
available at the marina, if you don't have your own and want to
give it a try. 
&lt;p&gt;Also you're welcome to drive about on the park roads, and there
are some interesting places around, but please do not go off the
roads. In most areas there are red signs stating that you aren't to
take vehicles any further, but sometimes they are missing. If
there's any doubt, don't drive there, since you will be driving
through State Wildlife Area...although the cache IS placed with
State Park Officer permission, and is on State Park land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've rated it a 3 difficulty mainly because once in the cache
area, it's fairly overgrown, and there is a lot of poison ivy
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest parking/boat launch area is near N40 23.436 W083
02.568. These are approximate for now, but should be close. I will
mark an actual waypoint for parking soon. You can also park/launch
at the marina, but it would make for a little longer trip to the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Mayfield Cemetery Cache&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyatt Cemetery is near the site of the former Fort Morrow. In
1810, Nathaniel Wyatt built a tavern along the Harrison Military
Road which ran near the present day US RT 23. This served as a
resting place for travelers going to and from Lake Erie. Because of
tensions in the area, a man named Captain Taylor directed the
building of a picket enclosure around the tavern. The new Fort
Morrow served to protect the establishment as well as to function
as a sanctuary for local settlers in case of Indian attack.
Although several scares brought families to its protective cover,
no actual attacks were recorded. Both Nathaniel Wyatt, and
Nathaniel Brundage are buried here, along with their families. The
two were the first white settlers of Marion County. Also in the
cemetery are thirteen unknown soldiers of the War of 1812, along
with veterans of several wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area also provides a scenic view of the Whetstone
River...also known as the Olentangy River due to it being misnamed
in 1833 by a legislative act that was attempting to restore Native
American names to certain rivers in the state. The word Olentangy
means &quot;River of Red Face Paint.&quot; and actually belonged to Big Darby
Creek, where the Wyandots got their red face paint. The Olentangy
River should have been named the Whetstone River. The literal
translation of the Delaware Indian name for the Olentangy River -
&quot;Kiin ansh ikan Siipu nk&quot; is &quot;Sharp/More and More/Tool/River,&quot; or
more precisely Whetstone.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache in a nice little community park. A small lock and
lock hidden in a typical manner.

A while back I had placed, and eventually archived &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3a1eb1c7-7d11-4f9f-b95a-1908f478aff1&quot;&gt;
The Infamous Battle Run&lt;/a&gt;. In my archival note I promised to
replace the cache, but never did.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I've finally gotten back out here. The location is not too far from
the old spot.&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is accessible from &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAWN until
DUSK every day except for July 4th&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. The town
launches their fireworks not far from the cache, and it would be
off limits for safety reasons.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The stream that the cache is hidden near is called the Battle Run.
According to local history, the creek was named as such because of
a small skirmish that happened here, outlined as follows...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
in 1820 the frontier settlements of what is now Prospect and the
surrounding townships became frightened by the possibility of
attack by the Wyandot Indians. A group of settlers formed a
horseback patrol called the &quot;Light Horse Guards.&quot; They were
stationed in Big Island and made frequent trips to the Prospect
area. During one such trip the Guards stopped to water their horses
at the Battle Run. One of the Light Horse Guards, named Morgan, got
into a skirmish with an Indian who demanded Morgan's necktie.
During the fight, Morgan grabbed the Indian's gun and hit him over
the head. At that time a number of Indians came out of hiding and
began to shoot at the settlers. Naturally, the Guards fled, and no
one else was injured. The next day, the Light Horse Guards returned
to find the Indians still in the area. The man that Morgan had hit
was found with a blanket over his head over a hot pot of water.
This method was used to cure many ailments. The Indian and Morgan
agreed to terms of peace. Morgan was to give a cart-load of
pumpkins to the Indian, and in return the Indian was to provide
Morgan with a saddle of venison. Following that peace was returned
to the settlement and the native villages of the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

The trails are rocky and flanked by steep drops on both sides in
places. There will also be areas where you will have to step across
crevices. The trail is mostly flat but there are some elevation
changes. The hike will be about .40/mi one way. A relatively small,
camouflaged Lock-n-Lock.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This has always been one of my favorite areas, and I recently found
out that it was purchased by the city and turned into a park a
little while back. When I was younger I used to paintball, and
mountain bike back through here. At that time we had &quot;blind eye&quot;
permission to be there. When I started caching this was one of the
first areas I thought about placing a cache, but the private
property issue stopped me. So I was thrilled to find out it's now a
public park. Ok, enough babbling.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is not suggested for kids or anyone with a fear of heights.
Like I said above, the terrain is rather tough. It starts out easy
but then follows along a narrow stone ridge between two old
quarries. Part of the trail are wide enough for one person with
long drops on either side. I would also suggest not going after
this one when it's dark, wet, or snowy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Park at N 40° 36.535 W 083° 09.108 (off of Hillman Ford
Rd./Fountain St.) and enter the woods to the south of the parking
area. The park has recently expanded, and all quarry operations
have pulled out. That leaves a new, and legal, parking area open.
It's a slightly longer walk from the new parking area, but there
are some remains of the quarry operations along the way that are
interesting. Depending on exactly how you head in you may see half
of an old park boundary sign that no longer applies with the new
addition. The sign is very near to the limestone mound you'll
pass.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please be sure to hide the cache as you found it. Even though it
can be a rough hike there's evidence that people do come out here
with some frequency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKKCEQ - Parking for Quarry Cache&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 36.535 W 083° 09.108&lt;br/&gt;Older parking area off of Hillman-Ford Rd./Fountain St.&lt;br/&gt;QPKCEQ - Newer parking.  Slightly longer hike.&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 36.210 W 083° 09.017&lt;br/&gt;Accessed by turning north off of Fairground street just east of the railroad.  It may seem like you're turning onto the railroad right-of-way...and you are, but it is completely legal, and there is a park rules sign at the gate.  It has small print so it is difficult to read from Fairground St.</groundspeak:long_description>

Easy walk, through a nice old cemetery, with a little bit of a
hill. The cache is a decon box. As with any cemetery cache, DO NOT
try to find this at night, and be respectful.

This cache was placed in memory of a dear friend, SherwoodForest. 
&lt;p&gt;Eric &quot;SherwoodForest&quot; was a very special Geocacher. A
Self-Proclaimed Ambassador, he not only represented the Northeast
Ohio Geocachers at events in other areas, he was an advocate for
the entire sport to park districts, lawmakers, and even people on
the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that with an attitude like this, that Eric might
have been arrogant or boastful. Nothing could be further from the
truth. Eric has a mild demeanor that earned him the common
description &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;. Eric won friends by listening. He
encouraged and welcomed the people who were least convinced of
their sanity in enjoying such an underground sport. He encouraged
people on to their personal bests and challenged all of us to
expect more from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric is partly responsible for many big initiatives in Ohio. He
was instrumental in the formation of GeocacheOhio (GO) and the
Midwest GeoBash. He helped promote the All-Ohio Women's Event and
aided in the flight of the men-folk with the matching &quot;Ohio Men's
Escape Weekend&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric is truely missed, but in so many ways his influence is all
around us. It's in the people, the caches and the culture of
Geocaching. To represent this, we have chosen to dedicate a series
of caches that we hope will represent the impact that our friend,
SherwoodForest had on our sport and our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Eric would say, &quot;Cache well, and see you 'round the
bend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cemetery is in the small town of Mexico. From what I could
tell, there is no post office, or commerce, but more of just a
community. I orignally came here looking for Badger Cemetery, but I
couldn't find it. I decided to stop here and look around, and found
many Badgers here. After some research it appears that Badger
Cemetery was relocated here, in Mexico Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is an attempt to make a challenging cache for the die
harders. Not everyone is expected to attempt to log this. Never
attempt a cache you are not comftorable with.

Park on the South side of the river for this one and there is a
nice social trail on the island to take you to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is an interesting spot I had visited many times when I
was younger. It is possible to reach it without aid of a boat, but
it takes a little guts. Now, the words of warning. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;*DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE RIVER WHEN THE WATER IS
HIGH*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;*IF USING A BOAT TO APPROACH THIS CACHE, DO SO FROM THE
LOWER LEVEL*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If walking, I've found the best way to do it is to scoot your feet,
not picking them up. The water off the back of the dam is normally
only a few feet deep (knee level on me), so walk towards that side.
You will also have to walk in the water on that side upon reaching
the other side of the dam. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once you are across, enjoy for the minute the wonderful view you
will see from this location. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
While in the area, there are several other caches to hunt within a
few miles. You might want to pack a picnic, and make a day of it.
The view at sunset from the area overlooking the dam is wonderful.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is full of little trinkets found around heathers house. I
will bring a travel bug back to this location once I obtain some.
Sign the log book and have a good time!

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;While cleaning out the storage room where my cache stuff was I
came across a large stash of potential cache containers. I figured
while I was out doing maint on Spooky Park I might as well hide my
first cache in several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at the Perrysburg Heights Community Center - a
small little park in the back corner of the area called &quot;Perrysburg
Heights&quot;. I'm surprised noone has dropped a cache back here
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is close to home so I should be able to maintain it.
As a matter of fact it's close to work too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

items. Should be an easy grab.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Old description follows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While out geocaching with Jason, we drove past a park that he
was familiar with. Out of the blue, he says &quot;let's hide a cache
there!&quot; It so happened that I had a pre-made micro cache that I was
given at the MiGo Winter Social, so this was a perfect opportunity
to hide it. Jason says him and his friends called it the spooky
park back in the day. It's really not that spooky -- It's a run
down old park with flipped over picnic benches and rusted out old
grilles. It looks like the locals now use it for paintball. Cache
is in the far back corner of the old park. The container has a
logbook, a candle, a MiGo wooden coin, and a few other items that
were already in the pre-made cache. I didn't even look closely at
the contents! Special thanks to the MiGo folks for the container
and the contents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Below here is new&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container will be replaced shortly with a new non-microfilm
container - smallish plastic storage container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And even newer as of 5/15/2011&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container has been replaced with another black microfilm. I
found the last version of this cache 86' from the posted coords
floating in what appears to be the seat of a fort. Considering all
the activity I seem to see back here from teenagers, I've relocated
the cache away from here.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is the second in the Crypto Challenge series.  To find and log this cache, you have to solve the cryptogram.  The coordinates take you to the first stage of this multi-staged puzzle cache.  At this stage, you will find a piece of information you need to solve the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second stage is a hide-a-key.  It doesn't have room for a pencil, so please bring one.  I suspect the next crypto will have a bigger end stage, but this is still a fairly easy one!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cryptogram is below.  Upon decoding it, you will be able to find the second stage of this cache.  Since so many people have found the first crypto challenge, I thought it was time to up the stakes a little.  This cipher is different, but not necessarily harder then the last one.  As always, I will offer hints on a limited basis if you get really stuck, but not like last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the Cyptogram!  Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

safest place to park.


This is our first cache, and in a park named after our first state,
so I figured the name was appropriate. This is a little park along
the river. It has no trails, but you often see fishermen down at
the mouth of the creek in the summer fishing. The name of the park
is &quot;Delaware Creek Park&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the parking area, you will have to approach from the
back. You can do this off Marango on river road. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small Mooptainer. It is fairly well hidden. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It contains a small number of items as it is fairly hard to get
larger items in it. &lt;br/&gt;

downtown near the oliver house - I enjoy this place, and the view.
Small magnetic micro - bring a pencil. This is the first of several
I hope to place downtown where I work.

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the Oliver House. This historic house
is the oldest standing structure downtown. From this spot, you have
a wondeful view of the Anthony Wayne Bridge, the Oliver House, and
of course the Toledo skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now converted to a restaraunt complex, it houses Mutz,
Rockwells, and the Maumee Bay Brewing Company. The Brewpub is now
the brewer of Buckeye Beer, which was very well known back in the
early 1900's. The following information is from beerfestivals.org:
Few non-beer geeks know that Buckeye Brewing played a significant
role in American brewing history. Struggling to survive, the
brewery sold its recipe for light beer to Chicago-based Peter Hand
Brewing Company, which sold it under the name &quot;Meister Bräu Lite.&quot;
While Peter Hand knew how to brew light beer, it didn't know how to
market it. Enter Miller Brewing Company, which bought the recipe
and, more importantly, the &quot;Lite&quot; trademark. Miller coined the
phrase, &quot;everything you wanted in a beer, and less&quot;; recruited
retired athletes such as Bubba Smith and John Madden as endorsers;
and put its marketing muscle behind new Miller Lite. And you all
know the rest of that story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Thursday nights I can be found inhabiting Mutz, which is on
the premises. If you are in the area hunting the cache, stop in and
say hi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, come one, come all! Visit this historic place - take in the
view, and sign the cache log!&lt;/p&gt;

Had to move a little bit to make the grab on this one, but was an easy find in a nice location. Stopped by to take a snap of the historical marker nearby and take a picture as well. TNLNSL.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is the first in the OC only series of Contrary Vaters.
I don't like giving detailed descriptions for my hides unless I find it to be important, rendering this description non-contrary.
I prefer placing caches with function beyond caching or have a potential nerve wracking terrain.
I prefer to place caches above, in or at the least near water.
I'm also not known for camouflage.
I am extremely picky about my coordinates.
Let me tell you how picky.
My GPSr will do waypoint averaging with a dilution of precision threshold and it displays a accuracy deviation. I set my GPSr in the spot for the cache and run the averaging for a half hour minimum, If the sample shows a deviation of more than 15' then I reject it and start over again. Then I repeat the process on a different day during a different time, several times over and then average them all.
I also take an average every time I do cache maintenance but I reject any that deviate more than 10'. 
This time:
I have taken 1 sample and during a rain storm to boot!
I have camouflaged the container.
The terrain is simple.
The only water that came into the picture is the rain.
Heck I'm even supplying a hint!

Here is your hint... &quot;SAND&quot;
WOW I didn't even try to hide it.

Don't bother telling me the coords are off because I know that they may be at times and at other times they may not be.
I am willing to add any vague hint you may come up with but do not post them, as there are ways to contact me privately.

Ya know on second thought. &quot;tracking AT warlocks-box.com&quot;
change AT to @ and remove the extraneous spaces.
A word of warning about this e-mail address, if you decide to use it for any other reason than the one I have put forth then you will end up permanently blocked for it. No ifs ands or buts, I don't care if you are praising me, calling me god and sending me 10% of your income. 

Extra notes:
Once this cache gets 5 legitimate sounding DNFs then I will take the Physical education out of it and supply an encrypted hint.
Some of my Contrary Vaters (not this one) will be listed with a note that &quot;Once this cache has existed for 6 month, IF you have a better placement that this cache interferes with then contact me.&quot;

This is Southeast Michigan's first cache to use Garmin's new
chirp™ technology. In order to find this cache, you will need
a chirp™-enabled Garmin GPSr (Garmin Oregon 300, 400, 450 or
550; Garmin Dakota 20; or the Garmin GPSMAP 62 / 78) updated with
the latest software (see the Garmin web site for
details) The chirp™ is a tiny wireless transmitter that,
when within range of an enabled GPSr, will convey the final cache
coordinates to that GPSr, as well as a hint and the number of times
an enabled GPSr has encountered the chirp™. This is a quick 2
stage multi. When you get within range with your Chirp enabled GPS,
you'll be given the coordinates for Stage 2.


Let me know what you think! Please follow all park rules, including
hours of operation. Generally, all Warren parks are dawn to dusk
unless otherwise posted!

Since this is a new technology, I'm not sure how sensitive the
various GPS models are to the chirp signal. I know that they claim
a distance of 30 meters, but as they say, your mileage may vary! If
you're having a problem getting the signal, standing on the cement
in the corner just northeast of the barbeque should be plenty
close.

Brought goodies to drop off, but there was no room. Cache includes small pencil and log, but nothing else.
Concealed VERY CLEVERLY!! This was my first Geocache hunt, so I wasn't sure what to expect, I was very pleased with the experience. Coordinates accurate within inches, good hint, great camouflage!
If you plan on finding this one, bring a small coin or something very small wrapped in plastic to keep it out of the elements to leave behind under the cache, as there isn't much room inside the cache container itself.</groundspeak:text>

Plenty of paths to choose from. Can either park at info center (slightly longer walk but better place to park) or at end of cul-du-sac's. 
Cache is a just a bit bigger than a peanut butter jar. Cammo-ed. Some trinkets and FTF gets the bag of coins.
I went biking around this undeveloped area of the sub (lots of paths) and said to myself, &quot;Self, this place needs a cache.&quot; So here we go. The name comes from the name of the sub. Gemstone Valley.
Plenty of bushes to hide you from muggles. 
Feel free to hike or bike around the other paths further into the area. Plenty of nature to spy on. 
Mosquitoes, nuff said there.</groundspeak:long_description>

Update 5/10/11: All of the ACC 10-10-10 Event caches have now been archived, however this 10-10-10 Event Cache will remain active to commemorate the premier event hosted by the Auto City Cachers and it's name has been changed from ACC #29-T-Bird. Thanks to all who came to the event and shared in all of our fun!! Keep watch... There's always more fun to come! =D   </groundspeak:long_description>

And of course do some caching.  To our surprise we were able to complete all the ACC Event caches.  What great weather we had today, do not think we will have many more like it this year.  Thanks to all that it took to put this together.   Found cache about  4:20 PM for my 10348 find.

This cache uses the new Garmin Chirp technology. You will need one
of the new Garmin Chirp enabled GPSr units to be able to find this
cache.

This is my first chirp cache and I wanted to have a little fun
with this new technology. Thanks to srstuart for his help with
setting up this cache!

When you arrive at the posted coords with your Chirp enabled
GPSr, you will be given further instructions as to how to find the
final. For a list of compatible Garmin GPS's, please see the
Garmin

Chirp page for more information.

2/3/11: Since this is a new technology, I'm not sure how sensitive
the various GPS models are to the chirp signal. I know that they
claim a distance of 30 meters, but as they say, your mileage may
vary! Given some of the comments, I updated the coords to be closer
to the building, but the original coordinates were well within the
&quot;30 meter&quot; range.

It did make for some very muddy areas but it still was better that freezing temps.  I was also able to break my old record of 52 caches in a day, new record set today is 62.  Well this one gave me some problems.  Found the chirp and it started downloading and then stopped at 15%.  Restarted and could not pick up the chirp signal again.  So we just went off Gnarles GPS.  I think there are still some bugs to be worked out of this new chirp software.  I think I will give it another try on Saturday while I am at the event.  Found cache about 12:00 PM for my 11186 find.

The name comes from one of my students. She thought of a simple rhyme for geo (as in geocache).
Parking is nearby at the park/school. This could even be a P&amp;G if done right.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The container you seek is a cylindrical nano and contains only a
log; please bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;
You may wish to employ the use of a log extraction device.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mrs. and I were in town for a party and visiting my family (we
are in-town two or three times a year - I lived in Bay City for 24
years before moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana).&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One of the Tallest mountains in the Algoma Region.

Before the 1970 Ordinance Survey, Ogidaki was thought to be Ontarios High point. It has since plummeted in status, but is still in the top 10. Ogidaki is the Woods Cree word for mountain.

Using the below waypoints, follow the points below along some old logging roads. Follow it to the Top of the mountain, and enjoy the hike. There is a Fire tower up here that has been modernized and automated.

Total hiking time varies greatly by how far you wish to take your car up the logging roads. Bring water, food, bug spray and bear repellent of your choice.</groundspeak:long_description>
