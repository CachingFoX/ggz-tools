            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Overlook from near the top of a natural barrier between Rifle and Parachute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Webster Hill has long been an impediment to travel along the Colorado River.  The first wagon roads had to stay on the south side of the river; the railroad went around a large river bend, and the first road on the north side of the river had to make a circuitous route to the top of the hill.  In 1936, the railroad punched a bypass through the hill; by the 1940's the state highway department realigned the highway so that it went through a pretty significant - for the time - cut.  Then in the 1970's, the interstate was blasted through marking the end of Webster Hill as anything but another small hill along a very scenic highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the cache you can see the impact natural gas drilling has had on the ecology of the area, and can judge for yourself whether the drilling companies have lived up to their promises to reclaim the land once they were done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three ways to get to the cache:  easy (from the west), difficult (from the north) and impossible (from the east).  Don't try to stop along I-70; instead, take the frontage road from either Rulison (Exit 81) or West Rifle (Exit 87).  No need to cross any fences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Went to check on it, and the original had been muggled.  It's now a bison tube. BYOP.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggested Parking Area about 1/4 mile WEST of the cache location on US 6.  Much easier than going straight up the hill!:  N 39° 30.346 W 107° 53.090  </groundspeak:long_description>

The hardest part for the uninitiated is navigating the roundabouts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple of years ago I stopped by our (then) new coffee house, bought a copy of the New York Times and a cappucino; driving home, I tuned into classical music on the FM radio.  &quot;This can't be Rifle!&quot; I thought to myself.  But the town is changing dramatically, and mostly for the better.  There are two brand new hotels, and with the decrease in the gas drilling activity lately, they are anxious for business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This spot has become a rendezvous point on weekend mornings for motorcyclists (like me) who would rather ride from coffee shop to coffee shop than from tavern to tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the break and Starbuck's carb bar. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Cache Description --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 25 June, 1876, the 7th US Cavalry found itself defending this hilltop, and their lives, against warriors of the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe Nations. As the situation became more desperate for the cavalrymen, many of their horses were sacrificed and shot in order to create a defensive breastwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three years later, in 1879, a cordwood monument was erected by a detail under the command of Capt. G.K. Sanderson atop of the same hill. The surrounding area, strewn with cavalry horse skeletons, was policed and the remains collected and placed inside the monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1881, Lt. Charles F. Roe and a detail from the 2nd US Cavalry replaced the cordwood monument with the present granite one and interred the 7th Cavalry casualties around its base. In reverence for their noble companions, the cavalrymen dug a cemetary for the fallen horses and lined it with the cordwood from the original monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the horse cemetary is marked with a white granite marker and information plaque, just east of the 7th Cavlary Monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking and a paved sidewalk.

You can park at the edge of the road but it would be preferable to find a nearby approach and walk at least in farming seasons to allow large equipment room to pass. Please do not tell the locals your goal. There is a survey stake at GZ which could be your reason for being there.  It is not your typical container for this type of placement.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is a great history write up in Patchwork of Memories online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourroouts.ca&quot;&gt;www.ourroots.ca&lt;/a&gt;. The story is too large for here and quite in depth.&lt;br /&gt;
Another bit of history you won't find there is available online as well in the Montreal Gazette, date of October 26, 1985, Page 85 &quot;When love can be a crime&quot; and April 9, 1984 &quot;Anne Murrary play a look at obsessive infatuation&quot;  about the 20 year pursuit of a local farmer from this Hamlet who stalked Canadian singer, Anne Murray.</groundspeak:long_description>

(GC#972) - 9 of 51 for today's efforts!

Out on a caching run with 64andy today in hopes to locate our 1,000th GeoCache! This was just one of many caches we visited along our route today.

Thanks for taking the time to drop off this cache for us to find. Was a great Autumn day to cache.

Just have to read a little more to see if one can import Geocaching finds here? Just how does this work, since some people will OpenCaching more than Geocaching.com &amp; visa versa. Hmm...</groundspeak:text>

As there was no day care in those days I went to school.. It was the only time I ever got the strap and that was from Mom as I was a bit of a hoolegan. This one must have been a nice one. Too bad that all that's left is the foundation. The old horse barn seems to have faired a bit better, I spent up to grade one in a one room school then went to town for the rest of my schooling. I used to especially like to travel to school in the &quot;School van&quot; which was drawn by a team of hourses and had a small wood stove in it. Thanks for bringing me here and re-kindling these old memories.. TNLN.. SL.. TFTC.. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 5 stage Puzzle-cache. You must visit  puzzle cache stages 1-4 to calculate the actual final cache co-ordinates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Completion of this Puzzle-cache will require an approximate point-to-point hiking distance of 14.5 Kilometres.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NOTE: There is a &quot;SpyNet Series&quot; clue in each stage as well as in the Final log sheet that you should copy and save in a safe place as it will be required to find the future SpyNet Final Mission Puzzle Cache!! You also need to record the actual coordinates of all cache stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR MISSION:&lt;br/&gt;The cryptography department has been busy deciphering intercepted transmissions from SpyNet operatives. This has been accomplished by establishing 4 listening posts near a suspected SpyNet Headquarters believed to be located deep in an impenetrable Aspen forest near Wilson Lake.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Your Mission is to locate these four listening posts (cache stages) and collect the data and clues that have been stored at each location. You must also calculate the point where a line drawn from stage 3 to stage 1 would intersect with a line drawn from stage 2 to stage 4 (&quot;X&quot; marks the spot). This reference point will enable you to locate the closest observation point to the SpyNet camp (final cache location). A distance and bearing from this reference point to the final cache will be provided to you in one of the stages you must visit. At the final stage you must sign the log sheet to prove that you have completed the mission. You will receive additional clues that will help you find the final SpyNet HQ location. The final cache will also contain a selection of tools and trade items you may wish to add to your tool kit.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specific Mission Details:&lt;br/&gt; • Stage 1 -Is located at the posted coordinates for this cache listing. It will contain the coordinates to stage 2 and will also contain clues required to locate the final SpyNet HQ location (Mission IV). Your Mission begins.. &lt;br/&gt;• Stage 2 - Contains the coordinates for stage 3 and will also contain clues required to locate the final SpyNet HQ location (Mission IV). It may or may not contain additional clues that would assist you in completing this mission. Stage 2 is hidden at the base of a poplar tree close to the West side of the road.&lt;br/&gt;• Stage 3 - Contains the coordinates for stage 4 and will also contain clues required to locate the final SpyNet HQ location (Mission IV). It may or may not contain additional clues that would assist you in completing this mission. When you complete Stage 3 you will have the 4 required co-ordinates necessary to calculate the &quot;Reference Point&quot; and also instructions on how to compute the Final Cache location. You may decide not to complete Stage 4 if you so choose. Remember to smile and wave for the hidden trail cameras..&lt;br/&gt;• Stage 4 - Is a &quot;Bonus Stage&quot; that you may complete if you so choose. It will contain &quot;Bonus Clues&quot; usefull when you complete the final SpyNet Puzzle Cache (Mission IV). It is located at the co-ordinates listed in Stage 3 approximately 860 meters from the calculated Reference point at a bering of 318 degrees.&lt;br/&gt; • &quot;The reference point&quot; -  This point is calculated using the actual coordinates of all four stages (1-4). It is calculated by finding the intersection of a line drawn from Stage 3 to Stage 1 and Stage 2 to Stage 4. The final cache will be located very close to this point and you will have been provided with the distance and bearing to the final cache location (you wrote down all the coordinates and clues as you visited each stage.. Right??). The reference point is clearly marked with florescent pink flagging at eye level. The estimated accuracy of this calculation should be within 10 meters.&lt;br/&gt; • The Final Cache - Is a large plastic container which contains the official log book for this mission, it also contains additional series clues and a selection of trade items you may find useful in your future missions. The final cache is at the base of a poplar tree hidden under a generous UPS (unidentified pile of sticks). Congratulations and thanks for volunteering for this mission. Good luck in your future adventures.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Additional Mission Notes:&lt;br/&gt; • The search area includes lands designated as provincial &quot;Wildlife Lands&quot;. Signs are posted as &quot;Hunting on foot only&quot;.&lt;br/&gt; • Stage 1 (the posted cache co-ordinates) is a camoed waterproof match container which contains the co-ordinates for stage 2 only.&lt;br/&gt; • Stages 2-4 are small camoed peanut butter jars and contain the coordinates to the next stage as well as mission and series hints for the next mission (Mission IV). They also contain a notebook and pencil that you may use to copy coordinates and hints to take with you to the next stage. Please only take a page or two and leave the notebook, pencil and sharpener in the cache for other cachers to use. Please replace the notebooks coil side down to avoid snagging on the lid.&lt;br/&gt; • Stage 4, &quot;The reference Point&quot; and Final Cache are located near the center of Section 27, Township 38, Range 13 West of the Third Meridian (South side of Wilson Lake). They are located on private land. Permission was received to place the caches. The land is posted as &quot;Hunting with Permission&quot; so you will require permission to &quot;hunt&quot; for these locations. Please visit the landowner co-ordinates of N52 17.897 W107 48.417 to request permission.&lt;br/&gt; • Mission planning is crucial to the sucessfull completion of the mission. Determining parking locations and roads/trails to each stage location is your responsibility. The point-to-point hiking distance may not be the best method of completion. Completing this mission may be best done with several trips.&lt;br/&gt; • You may wish to use a computer utility (such as COMPSYS21 or Google Earth) to compute the reference point location and final cache location.&lt;br/&gt; • The use of topographic maps may be an asset.&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>
