            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Overlook from near the top of a natural barrier between Rifle and Parachute.

Webster Hill has long been an impediment to travel along the Colorado River.  The first wagon roads had to stay on the south side of the river; the railroad went around a large river bend, and the first road on the north side of the river had to make a circuitous route to the top of the hill.  In 1936, the railroad punched a bypass through the hill; by the 1940's the state highway department realigned the highway so that it went through a pretty significant - for the time - cut.  Then in the 1970's, the interstate was blasted through marking the end of Webster Hill as anything but another small hill along a very scenic highway.

From the cache you can see the impact natural gas drilling has had on the ecology of the area, and can judge for yourself whether the drilling companies have lived up to their promises to reclaim the land once they were done.

There are three ways to get to the cache:  easy (from the west), difficult (from the north) and impossible (from the east).  Don't try to stop along I-70; instead, take the frontage road from either Rulison (Exit 81) or West Rifle (Exit 87).  No need to cross any fences.

Went to check on it, and the original had been muggled.  It's now a bison tube. BYOP.

A couple of years ago I stopped by our (then) new coffee house, bought a copy of the New York Times and a cappucino; driving home, I tuned into classical music on the FM radio.  &quot;This can't be Rifle!&quot; I thought to myself.  But the town is changing dramatically, and mostly for the better.  There are two brand new hotels, and with the decrease in the gas drilling activity lately, they are anxious for business.

This spot has become a rendezvous point on weekend mornings for motorcyclists (like me) who would rather ride from coffee shop to coffee shop than from tavern to tavern.

Enjoy the break and Starbuck's carb bar. </groundspeak:long_description>

On 25 June, 1876, the 7th US Cavalry found itself defending this hilltop, and their lives, against warriors of the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe Nations. As the situation became more desperate for the cavalrymen, many of their horses were sacrificed and shot in order to create a defensive breastwork.

Three years later, in 1879, a cordwood monument was erected by a detail under the command of Capt. G.K. Sanderson atop of the same hill. The surrounding area, strewn with cavalry horse skeletons, was policed and the remains collected and placed inside the monument.

In 1881, Lt. Charles F. Roe and a detail from the 2nd US Cavalry replaced the cordwood monument with the present granite one and interred the 7th Cavalry casualties around its base. In reverence for their noble companions, the cavalrymen dug a cemetary for the fallen horses and lined it with the cordwood from the original monument.

Today, the horse cemetary is marked with a white granite marker and information plaque, just east of the 7th Cavlary Monument.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
There is parking and a paved sidewalk. This listing is wheelchair accessible.

&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;

- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.
- There is a fee required to enter Little Bighorn Natinal Monument.

Out on a caching run with 64andy today in hopes to locate our 1,000th GeoCache! This was just one of many caches we visited along our route today.

Thanks for taking the time to drop off this cache for us to find. Was a great Autumn day to cache.

Just have to read a little more to see if one can import Geocaching finds here? Just how does this work, since some people will OpenCaching more than Geocaching.com &amp; visa versa. Hmm...</groundspeak:text>

He lived alone in this old house out here in the hills.
He was kind enough to start his tractor and pull 2 young fools out of a snow bank on spring evening.
Stay out of the house as it is in disrepair and dangerous.
Small lock and lock near back on side of house small items
for trade cattle in the area and be careful going
through fences.

foundation could be a problem so keep kids and pets under supervision
This is the site of an old one room school called Zealhar as
it was roughly halfway between Zealandia and Harris. My mother taught in a one room school such as this so thought it would be good place for a cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My mom also taught in several one room rural schools. My earliest recollection is when I was about 4. As there was no day care in those days I went to school.. It was the only time I ever got the strap and that was from Mom as I was a bit of a hoolegan. This one must have been a nice one. Too bad that all that's left is the foundation. The old horse barn seems to have faired a bit better, I spent up to grade one in a one room school then went to town for the rest of my schooling. I used to especially like to travel to school in the &quot;School van&quot; which was drawn by a team of hourses and had a small wood stove in it. Thanks for bringing me here and re-kindling these old memories.. TNLN.. SL.. TFTC.. </groundspeak:text>
