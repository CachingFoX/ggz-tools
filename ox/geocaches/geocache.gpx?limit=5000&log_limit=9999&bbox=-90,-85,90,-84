&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the mouth of the Apalachicola River
in Apalachicola, Florida. The path to access this cache is the
actual path of the old turn-style John Gorrie bridge which was
replaced in the 80's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Gorrie is considered the father of air conditioning and
refrigeration and represents Florida with his statue placed in the
National Statuary Hall in Washington D.C. More information about
Dr. John Gorrie can be found at http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/gorrie.cfm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to check out Dr. Gorrie's other cache location,&lt;br /&gt;

I forgot to download the cache info for this bonus cache, but after getting all of the numbers, is was easy to figure out.  Searched around for a few minutes before I found the cache on the other side of the trail.  I think that I wrote that I left a rubber duck in the cache, but I found one in my pocked later at store.  So I guess that I lied about that.  Thanks again for this great series and a bunch of fun FTFs on this otherwise dull Saturday!  Took a TB and Geocoin that have yet to be logged into the cache and wanted to leave a rubber duck.</groundspeak:text>

The lower 16 miles of the trail is managed by the Department of Environmental Protection’s Office of Greenways &amp; Trails with another 4.5 miles north of the trail head maintained by the City of Tallahassee.  The railway operated from 1836 to 1983 transporting goods like cotton, turpentine and timber and during the Civil War, transporting troops.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;Today the trail is enjoyed by runners, walkers, bikers, and in-line skaters. There is an adjacent unpaved trail for equestrian riders, too!

It was very overcast the day the caches were placed, so the hints are strong in case the GPS is inaccurate.  The coordinates will be adjusted with input from you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great opportunity to get out on the trail!  You can do the whole 16 miles in one shot and get the bonus on the way back or each one can be a park-n-grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot to Miles and Rick at the Office of Greenways &amp; Trails for their support for these caches.</groundspeak:long_description>

We decided to try and work on our personal GA Counties quest and the GA Delorme challenge (PAGE 57). My son 'bout pee'd on himself when a HUGE lizard jumped across his arm as he was reaching for the cache!  We had a good laugh! Cache is in great shape and ready for the next cacher! TNLNSL TFTH

I pass by this little park every day on my way to work have often wondered why it was here, so I finally stopped to check it out and decided to place a cache to bring others here too. It is a nice quiet place to sit and reflect. Please use stealth if muggles are near, and be careful to replace cache exactly as found in order to aid in camouflage. Tweezers or a safety pin will be helpful in extracting the log. If you have any problems with the coords please let me know.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This letterbox/geocache hybrid is located outside of our office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neighboring business owners know about this cache so feel free to search anytime. However, as with any geocache, please use reasonable stealth as to not give up the nature of the hide, especially if searching during business hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache has room for small trade items and is a safe location to drop off travel bugs and coins. Although this is an easy find, it cannot be reached from a wheelchair, thus the D/T rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a rubber stamp and ink pad in the cache. They are not swag, so please do NOT remove them. This is for letterboxers to stamp their journals with, and I hope they will stamp their signature stamps in our logbook as well. Our family enjoys both geocaching and letterboxing, and we like to see the different personalized stamps that letterboxers create. If you don't understand the name of the cache, Google it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Letterboxing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letterboxing is an intriguing pastime combining artistic ability with &quot;treasure-hunts&quot; in parks, forests, and cities around the world. Participants seek out hidden letterboxes by cracking codes and following clues. The prize: an image from a miniature piece of art known as a rubber stamp - usually a unique, hand-carved creation. Letterboxers stamp their discoveries in a personal journal, then use their own rubber stamp, called a signature stamp, by stamping it into the logbook found with the letterbox, perhaps writing a note about their adventures in finding the letterbox. Although much like geocaching, letterboxing is a relatively low-tech activity which requires following clues instead of using GPS coordinates. Secret codes, orienteering, trivia, and puzzles are among the possible clue requirements for finding a letterbox. Originating in Dartmoor, England in the mid-1800's, letterboxes can now be found around the globe, including more than 23,000 in the United States alone. </groundspeak:long_description>

The difficulty rating is because it cannot be reached from a wheelchair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I could not believe that there was not a cache in Smithville, so I felt the need to put one here! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located in the Diane Smith Memorial Park, named for and dedicated to the memory of Diane Smith, the founder of the Smithville Improvement Group and late wife of former mayor Jack Smith. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This park is the site of Smithville's annual Chicken Pie Festival, hence the name of the cache. The highlight of the festival is the chicken pie contest, in which area residents compete for top honors with their homemade chicken pie dishes. Plates of yummy chicken pie are sold after the judging and the line of hungry patrons usually stretches down the street. The festival is held on the last Saturday of October each year, so if you find yourself in the area around that time, stop by and sample the homemade chicken pie!</groundspeak:long_description>

The log is big enough to leave a short novel or a simple signature. Let me know what brought you here, tell a story if you have time!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Infantry Museum emphasizes the values that define the Infantryman, as well as the nation he protects: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Multi will take you on a trip to several often overlooked places in Columbus,  Containers include a micro, small, and regular, all camouflaged but readily accessed.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stage 1&lt;/strong&gt;: After the Union victory in the Battle of Nashville (December, 1864), Union General George H. Thomas gave orders to General James H. Wilson to march into the heart of the Deep South to bring the Confederacy to its knees by destroying all of their supply centers such as Selma, Alabama, and Columbus, Georgia.  Confederates in Columbus were preparing for the fact that Wilson's 13,000 men were heading their direction in the days leading up to the battle. Confederate Major General Howell Cobb was in charge of the forces located in Columbus, and he began to prepare to defend the city of Columbus &quot;to the last ditch.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
A Memorial to this event is placed on the intersection of 14th Street and Broadway in downtown Columbus.&lt;br /&gt;
I won't place the entire story here, but please read up on it if you haven't already! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Columbus_%281865%29#The_Battle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While in the area of stage 1 take some time to visit the monument across the street.  Visit the Mott House, just down the road too.  &quot;This house never went out of the Union&quot; is a Columbus tradition. When Union General James H. Wilson needed a headquarters after the battle of Columbus, the owner of this dwelling is reported to have said that the Union (and not the Confederate flag) had always flown in his heart. So, Wilson accepted the hospitality of Randolph Lawler Mott, whose son John was adjutant on the staff of Gen. Henry L. Benning, giving credence to the claim that many families had members who fought on opposite sides of the war. &lt;strong&gt;Some of this information will be useful for finding the second stage!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Across the street from location is the resting place of several notable Columbus natives including Brigadier General Henry L. Benning (namesake of Fort Benning) and Francis Joseph Springer&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; A local grocer who took his savings and invested it in the construction of the theater that would bear his name, the Springer Opera House.  There are also portions marked in remembrance of the fallen Confederate fighters.  This stage requires you to search above J. Edmond Moore, across the street from Henry L. Benning's memorial.  There is a field puzzle that must be solved in order to progress to the final stage. &lt;strong&gt;Keep in mind that this is stage #2 (hint hint)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3&lt;/strong&gt;: A Combat Infantryman Badge is presented to Soldiers who have personally fought in active ground combat while an assigned member of either an infantry or a Special Forces unit.  This badge was created during WWII to distinguish the men of the Infantry from any other branch; this raised esprit de corps and created Soldiers proud of their Infantry title.  This is the largest CIB I have ever seen!  Be sure to exhibit some stealth as you move in to get this cache as some construction is still going on not too far from the cache site.  Parking is a short walk away, please park in the appropriate areas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several items for FTF and whoever follows, as well as some swag!  Please keep it stocked up!&lt;br /&gt;

placed this nano cache for the greatest of all geocaching
groups!!!

After leaving the 2nd Anniversary event today, and having such a
wonderful time with these great folks, we were riding down the road
and thinking about the great time that was had by all, and somehow
came up with the idea to place this cache. I'm not sure what it was
that made me think of it. I thought I had heard my wife suggest it,
but she later admitted that she hadn't, but it was my idea. I don't
know what it could have been that made me think of it. Possibly it
was something subliminal. But since the idea had made its way
through the convoluted parts of my brain, I thought 'MIGHT AS
WELL,' so I just went back to this spot and did it. Hope you all
like it!

Another offering in the FIRE/LOOKOUT TOWER series. This tower is
kept in nearly perfect condition. It is right next to a manned
Georgia Forestry Commission station. If you like finding these neat
structures, this one is a great specimen! 
&lt;p&gt;You will find the medium size lock n' lock box in another
location a short drive from the tower. To find the final cache, go
to the above coords and find the Tower. At the tower location,
there are two driveways, one on either side of the tower. Each has
a small blue sign with a two digit number on it. You will use these
numbers to easily find the coords for the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply multiply the two numbers XX x YY = ABCD&lt;br /&gt;
Final North Coordinates: N 32-28.468 + ABCD = N 32-??.???&lt;br /&gt;
Final West Coordinates: W084-10.660 + ABCD = W084-??.???&lt;br /&gt;
(remove the decimal point to add these numbers, then place it back
where it goes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the cache box about 1.4 miles away from the tower.
The box is placed next to a fence post, and is kind of in the open.
The terrain rating on this one has to do with briars, which may get
worse as the summer wears on. There is a very nice FTF prize for
the next week or so, as there are more blackberries in the area
than you could possibly pick, so bring a bowl if you come during
this time of year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the Muscogee Fire Tower near Columbus, Georgia. It is in
better shape than any of the towers that I have seen, although it
is secured behind security fencing to keep out tresspassers. The
tower is being used for radio equipment, as are many of these old
structures. The above coords are for the tower, and the geocache
itself is an offset cache. The tower is enclosed in fence, but
there is also a chain link fence that surrounds the yard on the
North and East sides. If you look in the NE corner, about 150'+
from the tower, you will find the LNL box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Placed near Thompson Lake, this cache needed to find some shade to get out of the 100+ degree weather we have been experiencing in 2012!  Stop in and say hello to the mid-sized water tight cache if you can find it!  Please take the chance to enjoy the area and to walk the trails close to the water.  This is a nice, secluded area that more should enjoy. Several pieces of swag were left in here, as well as a geocoin for the FTF to move along! Congrats to The Fuddster for FTF!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horace King, a South
Carolina native who was born in 1807, became known as a master
builder of bridges and buildings in Alabama, Georgia, and
Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 By the 1870s, King had built his famous &quot;lattice bridges&quot; over the
Chattahoochee River (at West Point, Columbus, Ft. Gaines), the
Flint River (at Albany), and the Oconee River (at Milledgeville)
and this one at Red Oak Creek, Gay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before the end of his life, King was even known as a political
figure, having served in the post-war Alabama Legislature as a
state representative from Russell County (1868-1872).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1870s, King moved to LaGrange, Georgia, where he and his
sons prospered through the work of their construction firm. King
died in 1887 and is buried in LaGrange’s Stonewall Cemetery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. William H. Green, an authority on the life and work of Horace
King, has said of King: &quot;Laborer and legislator, his life was an
astonishing symbolic bridge - a bridge not only between states, but
between men. Like one of his stately Town lattice bridges, Horace
King’s life soars above the murky waters historical limitations, of
human bondage and racial prejudice. He did not change the currents
of social history, but he did transcend them and stands as a
reminder of our common humanity, the potential of human spirit, the
power of human respect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last
remaining example of Mr. King's skill at bridge making. A tribute
to the man and his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the First to Find!&lt;/p&gt;

      READ ALL ABOUT IT!!! -- ***The Cache is NOT at the above
      coordinates***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things in this world that can make
      Superman weak in the knees. One is a green, glowing rock that
      just happens to be a radioactive chunk of his demolished home
      planet. The other is a brunette reporter with a nose for news
      and the initials L.L. For years, Clark Kent has tried to
      balance the fact that Superman belongs to the world with his
      desire to live a normal life with the woman of his dreams,
      Lois Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lois was around from the very beginning - her first comic book
appearance was the same as Superman's. Miss Lane and the Man of
Steel both made their debut in Action Comics #1 in June of 1938.
Clark seemed to have a thing for Lois right away. He asks her on a
date in that first issue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Superman can stop bullets and leap tall
buildings, it's Lois who has proven to be a true challenge for our
hero. Right from the start, she caught the attention of one of the
most powerful men in the universe, and he's been flying after her
ever since (usually to save her from danger). No matter who has
stepped into the role over the years, there has always been one
enduring and endearing quality about Lois Lane... she is the one
who gives Superman his humanity, because his dream for a normal
life as Clark Kent only makes sense with her by his
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more SUPER faces of Lois
Lane...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT at the
coordinates above, but to find Lois you will need to visit these
coordinates... but you must use your super powers to do so...
Driving to the first stage is a real waste of your time, so don't!
This is a mystery / puzzle cache, and your job is to solve the
mystery. Don't make it harder than it really is! Decoded the name
found at the above coordinates for the coordinates to the final
stage of this cache. Use the first word of the code name and find
the numeric values of the letters (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.) Mulitply
these four numbers to find a 5 digit number and then use the digits
of that number to fill in the missing coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;

I coaxed her down and took her home and made her my trailer park queen. All my friends just stood and stared she was more than they had seen. The first few days were really fun, even down right awesome. But when I saw her with her make up off she looked more like a possum. But still I was happy with my midnight queen, she liked my pool hall hangouts and all the redneck scenes.&lt;br/&gt;Then my heart got broken at a truck stop in Atlanta when I saw her with another man. I held my cool and waited then I followed him outside. I sneeked up behind him as he climbed up in his ride. I told him dude now you look here Kitty she is mine. And he said friend just hold your cool there is something that you should know. Kitty is my brother, and served time in prision with David Allen Coe. So I left Kitty in Atlanta and went back on the road.  </groundspeak:long_description>

looking for a small cache with a little extra camo, located on some
truly great hiking trails in West Georgia.

A little coded puzzle that should be easy for you to crack. The
picture below will give you the proper coordinates for the cache. I
hope this will be an interesting puzzle and hunt for all the great
cachers in this area. There is room in the cache for small trade
items, and I have included a special FTF prize too. If you get it,
you will be the first ever to have one of these! Good luck~

and return here for your smiley! 


It's completely different so I am opening it back up to be found by
previous finders too. There was a really nice row of trees on the
edge of the parking lot that afforded an oasis from the brutal heat
on the employees car here, as well as a great hiding place for my
cache. I can't imagine why they cut those trees down, but they are
gone, so I had to move the cache to a different tree. I hope you
all like this little hide... I do!

Listed in Frommer’s 500 Places to Visit with Your Kids Before They Grow Up and cited by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as one of “35   Natural Wonders in Georgia You Must See Before You Die,” Stone Mountain Park is located just 16 miles east of downtown Atlanta. The five square mile park is Georgia’s most visited attraction. Home to the world’s largest piece of exposed granite and this location was chosen because of its family friendly atmosphere, the cache will be fairly easy to find for new or veteran geocacher because of the kids that where at the park and aware of Geocaching. </groundspeak:long_description>

Whereas... I found a neat container in one of the caches that I
plundered today (hint for someone out there)... and Whereas so many
of my hometown caches are temporarily archived now... I decided to
place yet another cache on the SCT.

Most of my caches are very simple ones, so I am not going to give
any additional information on this one for now. Let's see how this
one goes... It's more difficult than most of my others, but was
found the first morning it was available by &lt;b&gt;AtlantaGal&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;Cymbaline&lt;/b&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;FTF!!!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

cache, and so with proper credit given to the originator of said
catchy name, I want to hide microcaches at many of these locations,
for that is where I have been employed for the last 27+

Log only, BYOP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The serpent tempted man to disobey God and brought sin and death into the world. Thus this cache is located between where many are laid to rest as a result of earthly death and where many, many others have discovered and celebrate the ultimate gift of eternal life. &lt;br/&gt;Note: It is NOT in the cemetary, please be respectful of those at rest and their families. Permission granted to place this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although snakes are generally found at ground level, this one isn't so there is no need to disassemble walls or piles of bricks. It will make sense when you find it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware of muggles during school hours and Sundays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to doctor mole for the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Go for a hike and grab an easy smiley. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Big Creek Greenway. Presently the Greenway extends approximately seven miles from McFarland Road to Bethelview Road – passing through Fowler Park along Highway 9. &lt;br/&gt;This is the first cache along the newest section of the Big Creek Greenway. Only attempt to access this cache from the Greenway – DO NOT attempt access from the adjacent business properties. The nearest trailhead parking coordinates are listed below. Traffic along the Greenway may require an exceptional amount of stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path to the Greenway from the parking lot is not complete and currently consists of a large gravel path. Once you reach the Greenway it is a nice concrete/boardwalk stroll until you approach the cache – where you have to leave the Greenway. Walking/biking distance to the cache is well over half a mile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greenway is subject to flooding, however, the cache should be protected from all but the most severe flood conditions. Access to the Greenway may be closed during flood conditions requiring that you delay your caching gratification until another day – at least for this particular cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have seen deer along the Greenway and you may encounter other furry, feathered, or scaled creatures. Also watch out for vicious plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to andy2049 for FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trailhead parking is at N 34° 06.513 W 084° 13.090.</groundspeak:long_description>

Presently the Greenway extends approximately seven miles from McFarland Road to Bethelview Road – passing through the future Fowler Park along Highway 9.  Only attempt to access this cache from the Greenway – DO NOT attempt access from the adjacent business properties or GA 400.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traffic along the Greenway may require an exceptional amount of stealth.  Many people like to walk their dogs along the greenway.  As you proceed about a mile down the greenway, your GPS will detect the chirp™ and give you the required information to proceed to your final destination.  Remember to keep your dog on a leash and always be considerate of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trailhead parking is at N34-06.513 W084-13.090.  </groundspeak:long_description>

About a mile from the Bethelview Road parking lot you will make a slight detour off the paved path to find the hidden bounty.  Watch out for muggles and crazy cyclists during peak hours.  Carefully choose your path and you will meet little resistance, choose poorly and the difficulty may be a 4! </groundspeak:long_description>

I was rather disappointed to note that there is not a cache here anymore.  So, in an effort to encourage my Georgia caching friends to come up to Chattanooga, I placed this cache here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you're just passing through, you can stop here and find this cache too.  This is a good place to stop and stretch your legs.  There's extra bathroom facilities here, in case it's busy... and there's lots of parking!  You can even stop for a picnic here, lots of picnic tables.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy this quick and easy cache and if you're planning on caching in Chattanooga... let me know! ;)

He started telling me that most of the time this is just a regular dam but when there's a full moon out it starts acting strange and transforms into a weir dam. Give me a break!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for an ammo can hidden in a likely spot. The trail up is a little slippery so be careful. Please hide it back better than you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just because 1 person did not find cache, does not mean it needs maintenance.  I will check on it soon to make sure it is still there.</groundspeak:text>

I'm not going to quote the plaque, you can read it yourself but this man had a lot to do with the creation of the Tellico Wildlife Management Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some reason I couldn't get very good coords here so I'll leave a &quot;giveaway&quot; hint for you. Bring a pen or pencil and please use stealth if people are near. You're looking for a large bison tube.</groundspeak:long_description>

Campbell who died in 1936 after making Troop 74 one of the most prominent scout troops in East Tennessee. Troop 74, established in 1926 and chartered in 1927, is one of the oldest continually running scout troops in the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scout lodge served for many years as the headquarters for Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Cub Scouts, and has been instrumental in molding the character of many children in the Etowah area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NYA was one of many agencies created during the Great Depression by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and whose main goal was to provide aid to unemployed young people. The NYA was a moral booster and provided the means for those who wanted to continue their education beyond high school but would not have been able to do so without this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scout lodge project, as well as many other NYA projects in the county, paid for the labor while various donors provided the materials. The Scout Lodge produced one of the best projects undertaken in the county. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You know exactly what happens when you’re riding around on the back roads with a bag of cache containers. Welcome to a new series of caches that are way out of the way. You are riding down Citico Rd. You can park within 100ft of the cache. You park pretty close to a nice looking, un-named waterfall. I take that back, it has a name now, Geologynut Falls (lol). You don't have to cross the creek to get to the cache (we did) but you do need to climb up a little hill. You are looking for a Lock&amp;Lock container with a log and some trade items but NO PEN (sorry). Enjoy the ride!</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was hoping to ride my dual sport motorcycle right up to the hidden cache...not to be.  The hill climb was short but tough, at least for this, out of shape, 64 year old grand-pa.  This was my attempt at finding a geo-cache....pretty cool.

I brought my own pen and signed the little log book with my name, cell phone # and date.  I was the first entry.  I took nothing out and didn't add anything, either.

I think I'll move on to Mt Pleasant caches next.   </groundspeak:text>

After using it on about 80-something caches, I was informed that the ink bleeds off the page when the log got wet. Sooooo, after a lot of checking and rechecking of my gsak info, I left the house with a list in hand to go back and resign those caches.

Every trip out here has been at night but someday I'd like to come back in daylight to enjoy the area as well as more caching. Thanks for placing caches for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Snake Boy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a boy who used to go bird hunting every day, and all the
birds he brought home he gave to his grandmother, who was very fond
of him. This made the rest of the family jealous, and they treated
him in such fashion that at last one day he told his grandmother he
would leave them all, but that she must not grieve for him. Next
morning he refused to eat any breakfast, but went off hungry to the
woods and was gone all day. In the evening he returned, bringing
with him a pair of deer horns, and went directly to the hothouse
(âsï), where his grandmother was waiting for him. He told the old
woman he must be alone that night, so she got up and went into the
house where the others were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At early daybreak she came again to the hothouse and looked in, and
there she saw an immense uktena that filled the âsï, with horns on
its head, but still with two human legs instead of a snake tail. It
was all that was left of her boy. He spoke to her and told her to
leave him, and she went away again from the door. When the sun was
well up, the uktena began slowly to crawl out, but it was full noon
before it was all out of the âsï. It made a terrible hissing noise
as it came out, and all the people ran from it. It crawled on
through the settlement, leaving a broad trail in the ground behind
it, until it came to a deep bend in the river, where it plunged in
and went under the water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The grandmother grieved much for her boy, until the others of the
family got angry and told her that as she thought so much of him
she ought to go and stay with him. So she left them and went along
the trail made by the uktena to the river and walked directly into
the water and disappeared. Once after that a man fishing near the
place saw her sitting on a large rock in the river, looking just as
she had always looked, but as soon as she caught sight of him she
jumped into the water and was gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is in the Carson Island Boat Ramp area. A 4x4 gets you
close, an ATV gets you closer! This area is heavily used by the
less evolved so trash is everywhere. There is also poison ivy close
to the cache so beware. You are looking for a flare tube. Please
hide it back well. If you are in a hurry please skip this
one!&lt;/p&gt;

traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Red Man And The Uktena.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two brothers went hunting together, and when they came to a good
camping place in the mountains they made a fire, and while one
gathered bark to put up a shelter the other started up the creek to
look for a deer. Soon he heard a noise on the top of the ridge as
if two animals were fighting. He hurried through the bushes to see
what it might be, and when he came to the spot he found a great
uktena coiled around a man and choking him to death. The man was
fighting for his life, and called out to the hunter: &quot;Help me,
nephew; he is your enemy as well as mine.&quot; The hunter took good
aim, and, drawing the arrow to the head, sent it through the body
of the uktena, so that the blood spouted from the hole. The snake
loosed its coils with a snapping noise, and went tumbling down the
ridge into the valley, tearing up the earth like a water spout as
it rolled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stranger stood up, and it was the Asga'ya Gi'gägeï, the Red Man
of the Lightning. He said to the hunter: &quot;You have helped me, and
now I will reward you, and give you a medicine so that you can
always find game.&quot; They waited until it was dark, and then went
down the ridge to where the dead uktena had rolled, but by this
time the birds and insects had eaten the body and only the bones
were left. In one place were flashes of light coming up from the
ground, and on digging here, just under the surface, the Red Man
found a scale of the uktena. Next he went over to a tree that had
been struck by lightning, and gathering a handful of splinters he
made a fire and burned the uktena scale to a coal. He wrapped this
in a piece of deerskin and gave it to the hunter, saying: &quot;As long
as you keep this you can always kill game.&quot; Then he told the hunter
that when he went back to camp he must hang up the medicine on a
tree outside, because it was very strong and dangerous. He told him
also that when he went into the cabin he would find his brother
lying inside nearly dead on account of the presence of the uktena's
scale, but he must take a small piece of cane, which the Red Man
gave him, and scrape a little of it into water and give it to his
brother to drink and he would be well again. Then the Red Man was
gone, and the hunter could not see where he went. He returned to
camp alone, and found his brother very sick, but soon cured him
with the medicine from the cane, and that, day and the next, and
every day after, he found game whenever he went for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is in the Carson Island Boat Ramp area. A 4x4 or a 2whl
drive with good clearance gets you close. Once again those who have
not made the climb up the evolutionary ladder hang out here so
beautiful views are marred by trash. You are looking for a flare
tube. Please hide this one back well. If you are in a hurry please
skip this one!&lt;/p&gt;

Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Tsundige'wï.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once some young men of the Cherokee set out to see what was in the
world and traveled south until they came to a tribe of little
people called Tsundige'wï, with very queer shaped bodies, hardly
tall enough to reach up to a man's knee, who had no houses, but
lived in nests scooped in the sand and covered over with dried
grass. The little fellows were so weak and puny that they could not
fight at all, and were in constant terror from the wild geese and
other birds that used to come in great flocks from the south to
make war upon them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just at the time that the travelers got there they found the little
men in great fear, because there was a strong wind blowing from the
south and it blew white feathers and down along the sand, so that
the Tsundige'wï knew their enemies were coming not far behind. The
Cherokee asked them why, they did not defend themselves, but they
said they could not, because they did not know how. There was no
time to make bows and arrows, but the travelers told them to take
sticks for clubs, and showed them where to strike the birds on the
necks to kill them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The wind blew for several days, and at last the birds came, so many
that they were like a great cloud in the air, and alighted on the
sands. The little men ran to their nests, and the birds followed
and stuck in their long bills to pull them out and eat them. This
time. though, the Tsundige'wï had their clubs, and they struck the
birds on the neck, as the Cherokee had shown them, and killed so
many that at last the others were glad to spread their wings and
fly away again to the south.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The little men thanked the Cherokee for their help and gave them
the best they had until the travelers went on to see the other
tribes. They heard afterwards that the birds came again several
times, but that the Tsundige'wï always drove them off with their
clubs, until a flock of sandhill cranes came. They were so tall
that the little men could not reach up to strike them on the neck,
and so at last the cranes killed them all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You may know it better by Thunderbird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legend of the “Tlanuwa,” or the “Great Mythic Hawk,” is a Cherokee variation of the Thunderbird and Piasa Bird myths found in other Native American cultures. Tlanuwa were a pair of immense raptors said to live in the caves of a high cliff just below the mouth of Citco Creek on the north bank of the Little Tennessee River in Blount County. According to legend, they flew up and down the river in search of prey, even coming into villages and carrying off dogs and small children. In one famous incident, Daniel Boone claimed to have seen a giant raptor on the Tennessee River near where the Cherokee claimed the Tlanuwa made its home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is in the area where these sighting have been reported.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of The Corn Woman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cooking is an important part of life for the Cherokee woman. Not only is it necessary for life and nourishment, but it is part of the social fabric. Even in our traditional story of first man and first woman, Selu is known as &quot;Corn Woman.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selu lived with her husband, Kanati, and two sons. Everyday, she would go away from the house and return with a basket full of corn. The boys wondered where the corn came from, so they followed her one day They saw her go into a storehouse, and they peeked in and watched her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There they saw her place her basket and shake herself. The corn started falling from her body into the basket. They thought that their mother must surely be a witch and that they must destroy her!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selu could read the boys' thoughts. She told them that after they put her to death, they would need to follow her instructions carefully so that they would continue to have corn for nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;After you kill me, you must clear some ground in front of our house. Drag my body in a circle seven times. Then, you must stay up all night and watch.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The boys did this, but they got the instructions backwards. They cleared seven areas of ground, and drug her body twice in a circle. Where her blood dropped, corn began to grow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the boys were careless in listening to the instructions, corn must now be planted and taken care of in order for it to grow. And to this day, it only grows in certain spots and not the entire earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit any
traditional Cherokee home and the woman of the house will provide a
delicious meal. As a matrilineal society, it is the woman who
carries the clan, gives nourishment to the growing baby, continues its growth by providing her milk, and continues to nourish all who come to her home by providing lovingly prepared food.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is in the Carson Woods Public Use Area. You are looking for a sandwich sized Lock&amp;Lock. Parking coords have been provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This cache is about the Origin of the Pleiades and the Pine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, when the world was new, there were seven boys who used to spend all their time down by the townhouse playing the gatayû'stï game, rolling a stone wheel along the ground and sliding a curved stick after it to strike it. Their mothers scolded, but it did no good, so one day they collected some gatayû'stï stones and boiled them in the pot with the corn for dinner. When the boys came home hungry their mothers dipped out the stones and said, &quot;Since you like the gatayû'stï better than the cornfield, take the stones now for your dinner.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boys were very angry, and went down to the townhouse, saying, &quot;As our mothers treat us this way, let us go where we shall never trouble them any more.&quot; They began a dance--some say it was the Feather dance-and went round and round the townhouse, praying to the spirits to help them. At last their mothers were afraid something was wrong and went out to look for them. They saw the boys still dancing around the townhouse, and as they watched they noticed that their feet were off the earth, and that with every round they rose higher and higher in the air. They ran to get their children, but it was too late, for then, were already above the roof of the townhouse--all but one, whose mother managed to pull him down with the gatayû'stï pole, but he struck the ground with such force that he sank into it and the earth closed over him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other six circled higher and higher until they went up to the sky, where we see them now as the Pleiades, which the Cherokee still call Ani'tsutsä (The Boys). The people grieved long after them, but the mother whose boy had gone into the ground came every morning and every evening to cry over the spot until the earth was damp with her tears. At last a little green shoot sprouted up and grew day by day until it became the tall tree that we call now the pine, and the pine is of the same nature as the stars and holds in itself the same bright light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a 4x6x2 Lock&amp;Lock. Please hide it back good!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Gados were a species of sentient humanoids with slender, fur-covered bodies. They had elongated necks and lanky limbs, and their heads featured only two large eyes and a pair of protruding incisors. Gados internal organs ran like ribbons throughout their bodies. This arrangement meant that any injury a Gados sustained was potentially critical, with the loss of an appendage almost certainly fatal. The species was incredibly nimble; they were known throughout the galaxy for their gymnastic skills, an ability made famous by the Leaping Tee group of acrobats who toured with the Alsakan Circo-Menagerie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gados were indigenous to the planet Abregado-rae in the Abregado system of the Core Worlds. They developed a simple society independent of their homeworld's other native sentients, the Moochers, and the galactic community largely left them to their own devices for millennia. However, their world's relative obscurity and its location at the head of the Rimma Trade Route made it an ideal staging area for pirates, smugglers, and other scoundrels. Gados were known as highly amenable, overlooking major eccentricities and breaches of protocol, tolerance that encouraged immigrants from the galactic fringe to come to Abregado-rae, and the ever-amiable Gados welcomed them and learned the secrets of galactic technology. Over time, the Gados abandoned most aspects of their native culture, including the Gados language. As their culture became congruent with the galactic standard, they assimilated into the amalgamated culture of the alien inhabitants of Abregado-rae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the rise of the New Republic, a multi-species oligarchy known as the Tundei regime took control of Abregado-rae's government and instigated strict new laws that challenged the longstanding frontier nature of the world. Although the Tundei tried to shift the planet's economy from criminal endeavors to manufacturing, conditions on the world worsened, and the Gados suffered. Especially heinous were new punishments for crimes, such as amputations and executions—which, to the Gados, were essentially the same thing. Nevertheless, some Gados supported the Tundei, working as spies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why a cache about an imaginary species from an imaginary star system? Look at the name of the street you are on, perfect fit!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mrs. Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of how Flint Visits the Rabbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the old days Täwi'skälä (Flint) lived up in the mountains, and all the animals hated him because he had helped to kill so many of them. They used to get together to talk over means to put him out of the way, but everybody was afraid to venture near his house until the Rabbit, who was the boldest leader among them, offered to go after Flint and try to kill him. They told him where to find him, and the Rabbit set out and at last came to Flint's house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flint was standing at his door when the Rabbit came up and said, sneeringly, &quot;Siyu'! Hello! Are you the fellow they call Flint?&quot; &quot;Yes; that's what they call me,&quot; answered Flint. &quot;Is this where you live?&quot; &quot;Yes; this is where I live.&quot; All this time the Rabbit was looking about the place trying to study out some plan to take Flint off his guard. He had expected Flint to invite him into the house, so he waited a little while, but when Flint made no move, he said, &quot;Well, my name is Rabbit; I've heard a good deal about you, so I came to invite you to come and see me.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flint wanted to know where the Rabbit's house was, and he told him it was down in the broom-grass field near the river. So Flint promised to make him a visit in a few days. &quot;Why not come now and have supper with me?&quot; said the Rabbit, and after a little coaxing Flint agreed and the two started down the mountain together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they came near the Rabbit's hole the Rabbit said, &quot;There is my house, but in summer I generally stay outside here where it is cooler.&quot; So he made a fire, and they had their supper on the grass. When it was over, Flint stretched out to rest and the Rabbit got some heavy sticks and his knife and cut out a mallet and wedge. Flint looked up and asked what that was for. &quot;Oh,&quot; said the Rabbit, &quot;I like to be doing something, and they may come handy.&quot; So Flint lay down again, and pretty soon he was sound asleep. The Rabbit spoke to him once or twice to make sure, but there was no answer. Then he came over to Flint and with one good blow of the mallet he drove the sharp stake into his body and ran with all his might for his own hole; but before he reached it there was a loud explosion, and pieces of flint flew all about. That is why we find flint in so many places now. One piece struck the Rabbit from behind and cut him just as he dived into his hole. He sat listening until everything seemed quiet again. Then he put his head out to look around, but just at that moment another piece fell and struck him on the lip and split it, as we still see it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is on the Jackson Bend Branch Trail but is close to the road. Please use the parking coords and make the very easy 100ft or so hike to the cache. If you decide to get the cache from the side of the road next to it the terrain goes up and you have a good chance of injuring yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a 4x4x6 Lock&amp;Lock. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LEAVE THE TRAIL TO GRAB THIS CACHE so please cover it back up well from all angles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking Coords - N 35° 39.469 W 084° 13.399</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While mapping this brand new section of the East Lakeshore Trail, Pretty Little Monster and I noticed this patch of cacti. PLM thought that cacti only grew in deserts so I explained that this was probably an old home site and was planted there by the owners a long time ago. I may be wrong and it may be natural to the area. You be the judge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Jackson Bend Trail and is still under construction. It will eventually link back up with East Coast Tellico Parkway but right now it stops about .5 mile short of the road. The Lock&amp;Lock container is about 1.5 miles down the trail. If you park at the Lotterdale Trail Head (seasonal) the walk to the cache is pretty easy. Using the Jackson Bend Trail Head (year round)adds another half star to the terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you plan on exploring the whole trail I must tell you that about .4 mile past the cache site the trail gets pretty steep in places from the 2 mile marker to almost the 3 mile marker. If I were to hide a cache in this area (hint, hint) it would be a 3.5 to 4 terrain. The trail should be complete by Fall 2011 so parking a vehicle at each trailhead makes the hike easier! I update the page as needed. Things we saw and heard while mapping this trail were: deer, owls, incredible rock outcroppings and formations, we also heard an eagle but never saw it. PLEASE HIDE IT BACK GOOD!</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache From Teeters Rd!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Origin Of Strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the first man was created and a mate was given to him, they
lived together very happily for a time, but then began to quarrel,
until at last the woman left her husband and started off toward
Nûñâgûñ'yï, the Sun land, in the east. The man followed alone and
grieving, but the woman kept on steadily ahead and never looked
behind, until Une'`länûñ'hï, the great Apportioner (the Sun), took
pity on him and asked him if he was still angry with his wife. He
said he was not, and Une'`länûñ'hï then asked him if he would like
to have her back again, to which he eagerly answered yes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So Une'`länûñ'hï caused a patch of the finest ripe huckleberries to
spring up along the path in front of the woman, but she passed by
without paving any attention to them. Farther on he put a clump Of
blackberries, but these also she refused to notice. Other fruits,
one, two, and three, and then some trees covered with beautiful red
service berries, were placed beside the path to tempt her, but she
still went on until suddenly she saw in front a patch of large ripe
strawberries, the first ever known. She stooped to gather a few to
eat, and as she picked them she chanced to turn her face to the
west, and at once the memory of her husband came back to her and
she found herself unable to go on. She sat down, but the longer she
waited the stronger became her desire, for her husband, and at last
she gathered a bunch of the finest berries and started back along
the path to give them to him. He met her kindly and they went home
together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is on the Jackson Bend Branch Branch trail of the East
Lakeshore Trail System. Stealth may be needed in the Winter months
due to the cache area being somewhat visible from Teeters Rd with
the leaves off. You are looking for a 4x6x2 Lock&amp;Lock. Please
hide it back good. I would suggest using the Jackson Bend Branch
Trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a PDF trail map I made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.team-geologynut.com/images/PDFs/JACKSONBEND.pdf&quot;&gt;Click
Here&lt;/a&gt; (The red dashed lines are long driveways or unnamed
streets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This trailhead is open year round, park in grass = N 35° 40.037 W 084° 13.992

This trailhead is closed during Winter months. Park in grass close to kiosk = N 35° 40.229 W 084° 14.353

really silly name for a cache series but these little pink
“bottle cap” caches are being placed to honor National
Breast Cancer Month which is the month of October.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It would be hard to find someone who isn’t related to someone
or at least knows someone who has been diagnosed with breast
cancer. Our cheers go out to those who’ve fought and won. Our
thoughts and prayers go out to those fighting right now as well as
those who’ve lost the battle!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As mentioned above, you are looking for a pink bottle cap cache
with log only. Please BYOP and use stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is for those who can't or won't read the entire cache description. You know who you are, you find the cache at night when it says daytime only, you park in the wrong spot, you get to ground zero and don't know what you're hunting (we do that one often!) and even worse, don't read the educational part of the Earthcache, this cache is for you. The cache is not at the posted coordinates (that usually goes on top of the page so we'll see how many have already failed and are at the posted coordinates trying to not get hit by a car).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need to find the cache is in the story below. After reading it and getting the info you need, go find the .30 ammo can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few days ago, a bunch of us cachers got together to plan a cache run. After a long discussion we decided to go North. After planning the cache run, loading the waypoints, and grabbing some snacks, three days had passed. We couldn't believe how long that had taken us and we were about to starve. Luckily it was Cinco de Mayo so we ran down to the local Mexican eatery for some fajitas and tequila.&lt;br/&gt;Four days later we recovered and were ready to cache. One thing was certain, we would need a pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had a great day of caching but after four hundred miles we were pretty tired. We found a motel just West of the interstate. Some of the group wanted to swim but I had zero enegry. At about eight o'clock, four of the guys started an intense game of Uno. After three games they called it quits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At nine the next morning we started caching home. The highlight of the trip was an incredible Earthcache. It had a moderate four mile hike that made the three terrain a little low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all was said and done, this cache trip was well worth the time and effort put in it!&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
the Cherokee Creation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earth is floating on the waters like a big island, hanging from
four rawhide ropes fastened at the top of the Sacred four
directions. The ropes are tied to the ceiling of the sky, which is
made of hard rock crystal. When the ropes break, this world will
come tumbling down, and all living things will fall with it and
die. Then everything will be as if the earth had never existed, for
water will cover it. Maybe the white man will bring this
about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, in the beginning also, water covered everything. Though
living creatures existed, their home was up there, above the
rainbow, and it was crowded. &quot;We are all jammed together,&quot; the
animals said. &quot;We need more room.&quot; Wondering what was under the
water, they sent Water Beetle to look around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Water Beetle skimmed over the surface but couldn't find any solid
footing, so he dived to the bottom and brought up a little dab of
soft mud. Magically the mud spread out in the four directions and
became this island we are living on – this earth. Someone
Powerful then fastened it to the sky ceiling with ropes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the beginning the earth was flat, soft, and moist. All the
animals were eager to live on it, and they kept sending down birds
to see if the mud had dried and hardened enough to take their
weight. But the birds flew back and said that there was still no
spot they could perch on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then the animals sent Gandfather Buzzard down. He flew very close
and saw that the earth was still soft, but when he glided low over
what would become Cherokee country, he found that the mud was
getting harder. By that time Buzzard was tired and dragging. When
he flapped his wings down they made a valley where they touched the
earth; when he swept them up, they made a mountain. The animals
watching from above the rainbow said, &quot;If he keeps on, there will
only be mountains,&quot; and they made him come back. That's why we have
so many mountains in Cherokee land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At last the earth was hard and dry enough, and the animals
descended. They couldn't see very well because they had no sun or
moon, and someone said, &quot;Lets grab Sun from up there behind the
rainbow! Lets get him down too!&quot; Pulling Sun down, they told him,
&quot;Here's a road for you,&quot; and showed him the way to go....from east
to west.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now they had light, but it was much too hot, because Sun was too
close to the earth. The crawfish had his back sticking out of a
stream, and Sun burned it red. His meat was spoiled forever, and
the people still won't eat crawfish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone asked the sorcerers, the shamans, to put Sun higher. They
pushed him up as high as a man, but it was still to hot. So they
pushed him farther, but it wasn't far enough. They tried four
times, and when they had Sun up to the height of four men, he was
just hot enough. Everyone was satisfied, so they left him
there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before making humans, Someone Powerful had created plants and
animals and had told them to stay awake and watch for seven days
and seven nights. (This is just what young men do today when they
fast and prepare for a ceremony). But most of the plants and
animals couldn't manage it, some fell asleep after one day, some
after two days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among the trees and other plants, only the cedar, pine, holly, and
laurel were still awake on the eighth morning. Someone Powerful
said to them: &quot;Because you watched and stayed awake as you had been
told, you will not lose your hair in the winter.&quot; So these plants
stay green all the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After creating plants and animals, Someone Powerful made man and
his sister. The man poked her with a fish and told her to go give
birth. After seven days she had a baby, and after seven more days
she had another, and every seven days another came. The humans
increased so quickly that Someone Powerful, thinking there would
soon be no more room on this earth, arranged things so that a woman
could have only one child every year. And that's how it was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, there is still another world under the one we live on. You can
reach it by going down a spring, a water hole; but you need
underworld people to be your scouts and guide you. The world under
our earth is exactly like ours, except that it's winter down there
when its summer up here. We can see that easily, because spring
water is warmer than the air in winter and cooler than the air in
summer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is on the Lotterdale Branch trail of the East Lakeshore
Trail System. You can park on the side of the road on Carpenter
Loop close to the trail sign. The easiest way to the cache is to
follow the trail a ways till it makes a left and the old road bed
goes straight. Follow the old road bed till you get to the lake
then find the faint unmarked trail to the left. That will get you
close to the flare tube you are looking for. There is a pen in the
cache but as usual you might want to bring your own. Please take
the time to hide it back good. For a PDF trail map I made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.team-geologynut.com/images/PDFs/LotterdaleBranch.pdf&quot;&gt;Click

Welcome to the Sinking Creek Segment of the East Lakeshore Trail. This segment is a moderate hike of 4.4 miles. This cache is about .5 miles down the trail from the Sinking Creek Branch trailhead or 3.9 from the Coytee trailhead. The trail has it's ups and downs but is still pretty easy. You can park at either end of the trail or both ends with 2 or more vehicles. If you're going to hike the whole trail be sure to bring some water. Although you'll be hiking next to the water for a lot of the trail, I wouldn't drink it (Tellico Lake). I've included parking and trailhead waypoints for your caching convenience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to
wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a small Lock&amp;Lock just beyond the &quot;Kissing Bridge&quot;. There is a mechanical pencil in the cache but you may want to bring a pen as well. Please cover it back up better than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs.
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of Why the Possum's Tail is Bare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Possum used to have a long, bushy tail, and was so proud of it that he combed it out every morning and sang about it at the dance, until the Rabbit, who had had no tail since the Bear pulled it out, became very jealous and made up his mind to play the Possum a trick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was to be a great council and a dance at which all the
animals were to be present. It was the Rabbit's business to send out the news, so as he was passing the Possum's place he stopped to ask him if he intended to be there. The Possum said he would come if he could have a special seat, &quot;because I have such a handsome tail that I ought to sit where everybody can see me.&quot; The Rabbit promised to attend to it and to send some one besides to comb and dress the Possum's tail for the dance, so the Possum was very much pleased and agreed to come.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then the Rabbit went over to the Cricket, who is such an expert hair cutter that the Indians call him the barber, and told him to go next morning and dress the Possum's tail for the dance that night. He told the Cricket just what to do and then went on about some other mischief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the morning the Cricket went to the Possum's house and said he had come to get him ready for the dance. So the Possum stretched himself out and shut his eyes while the Cricket combed out his tail and wrapped a red string around it to keep it smooth until night. But all this time, as he wound the string around, he was clipping off the hair close to the roots, and the Possum never knew it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it was night the Possum went to the townhouse where the dance was to be and found the best seat ready for him, just as the Rabbit had promised. When his turn came in the dance he loosened the string from his tail and stepped into the middle of the floor. The drummers began to drum and the Possum began to sing, &quot;See my beautiful tail.&quot; Everybody shouted and he danced around the circle and sang again, &quot;See what a fine color it has.&quot; They shouted again and he danced around another time, singing, &quot;See how it sweeps the ground.&quot; The animals shouted more loudly than ever, and the Possum
was delighted. He danced around again and sang, &quot;See how fine the fur is.&quot; Then everybody laughed so long that the Possum wondered what they meant. He looked around the circle of animals and they were all laughing at him. Then he looked down at his beautiful tail and saw that there was not a hair left upon it, but that it was as bare as the tail of a lizard. He was so much astonished and ashamed that he could not say a word, but rolled over helpless on the ground and grinned, as the Possum does to this day when taken by surprise..&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The First Fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the beginning there was no fire and the world was cold. Then the
Thunders (Ani'-Hyun'tikwsla'ski) who lived up in Galun'lati, sent
their lightning and put fire into the bottom of a hollow sycamore
tree which grew on an island.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The animals knew it was there, because they could see the smoke,
but they could not get to it because of the water. They held a
council to see what to do, and every animal that could fly or swim
was anxious to go after the fire. The Raven, large and strong was
sent first. He flew to the sycamore, but while he was wondering
what to do next, the fire scorched all his feathers black and he
came back without the fire. Next, the little Screech-owl (Wa'huhu')
volunteered to go, but once in the island, a blast of hot air came
up and nearly burned out his eyes. He managed to fly back home, but
his eyes are red to this day. Then the Hooting Owl ( U'guku') and
the Horned Owl (Tskili') went, but by the time they arrived, the
fire was burning so fiercely that the smoke nearly blinded them,
and the ashes carried up by the wind made white rings about their
eyes and they were never able to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now no more birds would venture, and so the little Uksu'hi snake,
the black racer, said he would swim to the island and bring the
fire back. He swam across to the island and crawled through the
grass to the tree, and went in by a small hole at the bottom. The
heat and smoke were too much for him, and after dodging about
blindly over the hot ashes until he was almost on fire himself, he
managed to get out, but his body had been scorched black, and he
has ever since had the habit of darting and doubling on his track
as if trying to escape from close quarters. He came back, and the
great blacksnake, Gulegi, &quot;The Climber&quot;, offered to go. He swam
over to the island and climbed up tree on the outside, but when he
put his head down into the hole, the smoke choked him so that fell
into the burning stump and before he could climb out again he too
was as black as the Uksu'hi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now they held another council, but all the animals had an excuse
for not going because they were all afraid until at last Kanane'ski
Amai'yehi (the Water Spider) said she would go. This is the water
spider with black downy hair and red stripes on her body. She can
run on top of the water or dive to the bottom, so there would be no
trouble reaching the island, but the question was, How could she
bring back the fire? &quot;I'll manage that&quot; said the Water Spider. So
she spun a thread from her body and wove it into a tusti bowl,
which she fastened on her back. Then she crossed over to the island
and through the grass to where the fire was still burning. She
placed one little coal of fire into her bowl, and came back with
it. Ever since we have had fire, and the Water Spider still keeps
her tusti bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

for a couple of cars at the small parking coordinates and room for several
cars at the new Coytee Parking Area coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a cache that takes special equipment that's why the diff/ter is so high. The first thing you need is darkness (preferably night but solar eclipses may work as well) and a good LED flashlight. You will be taking an easy 3 mile round trip hike in the woods next to the lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above coordinates will take you to the trailhead. There's a ton of parking next to the trailhead. Once you start down the trail, you will be looking for 3-D Stealth Fire Tacks to guide you to the cache. If you don't know what a 3-D Stealth Fire Tack is you can look at the background of this cache page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another reason for the difficulty rating is that this area is open to hunting in the Winter so hunters have placed some reflective tacks as well but these are small round white ones, not the 3-D Stealth Tacks you are looking for. They are also only on about the first .2 mile of the trail so once you get past that it's a breeze!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the terrain rating. The hike itself is a 2.5 terrain BUT you will be in the woods at night. These are real woods so there is a chance of encountering wildlife including skunks, racoons, opossum, coyotees, and snakes. Now for the actual cache. You are looking for a large ammo can. Special thanks goes to Destitute for giving us the can. If it wasn't for them, you would've been looking for a lame .30 cal, not a cool MORTAR CAN! Caching at night is extremely fun and this one should be a treat for everyone including kids (as long as you're with your parents!) I've included some very nice trade items. No McJunk here so please trade even!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need the hint to find the cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you cache alone or you just don't care to much for the woods at night BUT want to find this cache, email us through our profile and we'll be glad to go out there with you if we're in town.</groundspeak:long_description>

It would be hard to find someone who isn’t related to someone or at least knows someone who has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Our cheers go out to those who’ve fought and won. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those fighting right now as well as those who’ve lost the battle!&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mrs. Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of the The Hunter In The Däkwä'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the old days there was a great fish called the Däkwä', which lived in Tennessee river where Toco creek comes in at Däkwä', the &quot;Däkwä' place,&quot; above the mouth of Tellico, and which was so large that it could easily swallow a man. Once a canoe filled with warriors was crossing over from the town to the other side of the river, when the Däkwä' suddenly rose up under the boat and threw them all into the air. As they came down it swallowed one with a single snap of its jaws and dived with him to the bottom of the river. As soon as the hunter came to his senses he found that he had not been hurt, but it was so hot and close inside the Däkwä' that he was nearly smothered. As he groped around in the dark his hand struck a lot of mussel shells which the fish had swallowed, and taking one of these for a knife he began to cut his way out, until soon the fish grew uneasy at the scraping inside his stomach and came up to the top of the water for air. He kept on cutting until the fish was in such pain that it swam this way and that across the stream and thrashed the water into foam with its tail. Finally the hole was so large that he could look out and saw that the Däkwä' was now resting in shallow water near the shore. Reaching up he climbed out from the side of the fish, moving very carefully so that the Däkwä' would not know it, and then waded to shore and got back to the settlement, but the juices in the stomach of the great fish had scalded all the hair from his head and he was bald ever after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is on the North Branch trail of the East Lakeshore Trail System. You are looking for a 4x6x2 Lock&amp;Lock. There is a nice place to sit and sign the log and enjoy the view but watch out for the Däkwä'!</groundspeak:long_description>

Once here, look around for a large dark red object related to the railroad. On the side of this large dark red object is an X followed by 6 numbers. This will be your template to use for finding stage 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call the 6 numbers (from left to right) RSTXYZ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now use the following formula to get your stage 2 coordinates: R - 1 = A, S + 4 = B, T - 3 = C, X - 4 = D, Y + 2 = E, and Z - 3 = F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now just plug in the numbers to this set of coordinates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N35 42.ABC&lt;br/&gt;W084 22.DEF&lt;br/&gt;Check sum is A + B + C = 14, D + E + F = 6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you're ready to find stage 2. You don't have to stop to get the required info at stage 2 unless you feel like you need to. There is a small church with parking at the 2nd stage coordinates. When you get close to the coords, slow down and look to your left. You will see another large dark red railroad related item sitting in the middle of a field (private property). There are 6 numbers on the side of this item that will be used to find the final stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, call the 6 numbers (from left to right) RSTXYZ.&lt;br/&gt;Now use the following formula to get your final coordinates: R + 1 = A, S - 3 = B, T - 2 = C, X - 7 = D, Y - 4 = E, and Z + 6 = F.&lt;br/&gt;Now just plug in the numbers to this set of coordinates&lt;br/&gt;N35 40.ABC&lt;br/&gt;W084 23.DEF&lt;br/&gt;Check sum is A + B + C = 13, D + E + F = 11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are now ready to find an ammo can at the final set of coordinates.

Welcome to Friendsville Tennessee. Friendsville was named by the Quakers, who still have a Friends Meetinghouse in the community. Middle Tennessee State University's Center for Historic Preservation has stated that Friendsville, along with nearby Greenback, were stops on the Underground Railroad. This was due in part to the presence of the Quakers, who were leaders in the abolitionist movement. There used to be a cave near the Friendsville meeting house (since filled in) that fugitive slaves were hidden by Quaker William J. Hackney. The cave, which was stocked with provisions, was also used by men who wished to escape to the north to join the Union army.(Info was taken from www.wikipedia.org)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You are looking for a matchstick container. This is a pretty busy road so stealth will be needed. BYOP!

Nothing evil or anything, just a micro in the woods. Remember, GREEN BISON TUBE. There is a pen hidden near the green bison tube but you can BYOP if you want. I even hid some swag very near the green bison tube in the woods. It will be another 26,500 years from now before another micro is hidden in the woods by Team Geologynut so please enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking Coords = N 35° 45.482 W 084° 16.180</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of The Hunter And Selu.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A hunter had been tramping over the mountains all day long without finding any game and when the sun went down, he built a fire in a hollow stump, swallowed a few mouthfuls of corn gruel and lay down to sleep, tired out and completely discouraged. About the middle of the night he dreamed and seemed to hear the sound of beautiful singing, which continued until near daybreak and then appeared to die away into the upper air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All next day he hunted with the same poor success, and at night made his lonely camp again, in the woods. He slept and the strange dream came to him again, but so vividly that it seemed to him like an actual happening. Rousing himself before daylight, he still heard the song, and feeling sure now that it was real, he went in the direction of the sound and found that it came from a single green stalk of corn (selu). The plant spoke to him, and told him to cut off some of its roots and take them to his home in the settlement, and the next morning to chew them and &quot;go to water&quot; before anyone else was awake, and then to go out again into the woods, and he would kill many deer and from that time on would always be successful in the hunt. The corn plant continued to talk,
teaching him hunting secrets and telling him always to be generous with the game he took, until it was noon and the sun was high, when it suddenly took the form of a woman and rose gracefully into the air and was gone from sight, leaving the hunter alone in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He returned home and told his story, and all the people knew that he had seen Selu, the wife of Kana'tï. He did as the spirit had directed, and from that time was noted as the most successful of all the hunters in the settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is on the 2.3 mile Whites Creek Loop Trail in the Whites Creek Small Wildlife Area (TVA)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a decent size round Lock&amp;Lock. I tried hard to get a pen in there but couldn't so BYOP. The cache is only around 400ft from the parking area.&lt;/p&gt;

I gave it a &quot;2&quot; difficulty because its hidden at the base of a pine tree and if you look around, you see a bunch of them. I used a 60CSX and took 400 readings but still only got a 11ft reading so I raised the difficulty. Should still be easy!! You can park really close but use your parking break, trust me.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Water Cannibals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides the friendly Nûñnë'hï of the streams and mountains there is
a race of cannibal spirits, who stay at the bottom of the deep
rivers and live upon human flesh, especially that of little
children. They come out just after daybreak and go about unseen
from house to house until they find some one still asleep, when
they shoot him with their invisible arrows and carry the dead body
down under the water to feast upon it. That no one may know what
has happened they leave in place of the body a shade or image of
the dead man or little child, that wakes up and talks and goes
about just as he did, but there is no life in it, and in seven days
it withers and dies, and the people bury it and think they are
burying their dead friend. It was a long time before the people
found out about this, but now they always try to be awake at
daylight and wake up the children, telling them &quot;The hunters are
among you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the way they first knew about the water cannibals: There
was a man in Tïkwäli'tsï town who became sick and grew worse until
the doctors said he could not live, and then his friends went away
from the house and left him alone to die, They were not so kind to
each other in the old times as they are now, because they were
afraid of the witches that came to torment dying people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was alone several days, not able to rise from his bed, when one
morning an old woman came in at the door. She looked just like the
other women of the settlement, but he did not know her. She came
over to the bed and said, &quot;You are very sick and your friends seem
to have left you. Come with me and I will make you well.&quot; The man
was so near death that he could not move, but now her words made
him feel stronger at once, and he asked her where she wanted him to
go. &quot;We live close by; come with me and I will show you,&quot; said the
woman, so he got up from his bed and she led the way down to the
water. When she came to the water she stepped in and he followed,
and there was a road under the water, and another country there
just like that above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They went on until they came to a settlement with a great many
houses, and women going about their work and children playing. They
met a party of hunters coming in from a hunt, but instead of deer
or bear quarters hanging from their shoulders they carried the
bodies of dead men and children, and several of the bodies the man
knew for those of his own friends in Tïkwäli'tsï. They came to a
house and the woman said &quot;This is where I live,&quot; and took him in
and fixed a bed for him and made him comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By this time he was very hungry, but the woman knew his thoughts
and said, &quot;We must get him something to eat. She took one of the
bodies that the hunters had just brought in and cut off a slice to
roast. The man was terribly frightened, but she read his thoughts
again and said, &quot;I see you can not eat our food.&quot; Then she turned
away from him and held her hands before her stomach--so--and when
she turned around again she had them full of bread and beans such
as he used to have at home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So it was every day, until soon he was well and strong again. Then
she told him he might go home now, but he must be sure not to speak
to anyone for seven days, and if any of his friends should question
him he must make signs as if his throat were sore and keep silent.
She went with him along the same trail to the water's edge, and the
water closed over her and he went back alone to Tïkwäli'tsï. When
he came there his friends were surprised, because they thought he
had wandered off and died in the woods. They asked him where he had
been, but he only pointed to his throat and said nothing, so they
thought he was not yet well and let him alone until the seven days
were past, when he began to talk again and told the whole
story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is on the Hall Bend Trail System on Tellico Lake. You are looking for a flare tube. The Bing map on the cache page shows Hall Ferry Rd right next to the cache. That road has NOT been in existence since the late seventies! I'm a cartographer (GIS Administrator for Loudon County) and this kills me to see such crap on maps these days. The road has been gone for almost 30 years yet our high tech mapping system we depend on still shows it, go figure!  &lt;/p&gt;

Welcome to The Tellico Parkway Series of caches. You seek a screw top container painted to match it's surroundings. You get a lake side view of Tellico Dam from this location. Unless we're on the water, most of us just see the river side of the dam. I thought this was a very nice spot and a nice short walk. I spooked one of the biggest deer I've ever seen while walking to the cache location. Please follow the parking rules that are posted and DON'T BLOCK THE GATE. Enjoy the hunt!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Ustû'tlï.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was once a great serpent called the Ustû'tlï that made its
haunt upon Cohutta mountain. It was called the Ustû'tlï or &quot;foot&quot;
snake, because it did not glide like other snakes, but had feet at
each end of its body, and moved by strides or jerks, like a great
measuring worm. These feet were three-cornered and flat and could
hold on to the ground like suckers. It had no legs, but would raise
itself up on its hind feet, with its snaky head waving high in the
air until it found a good place to take a fresh hold; then it would
bend down and grip its front feet to the ground while it drew its
body up from behind. It could cross rivers and deep ravines by
throwing its head across and getting a grip with its front feet and
then swinging its body over. Wherever its footprints were found
there was danger. It used to bleat like a young fawn, and when the
hunter heard a fawn bleat in the woods he never looked for it, but
hurried away in the other direction. Up the mountain or down,
nothing could escape the Ustû'tlï's pursuit, but along the side of
the ridge it could not go, because the great weight of its swinging
head broke its hold on the ground when it moved sideways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It came to pass after a while that not a hunter about Cohutta would
venture near the mountain for dread of the Ustû'tlï. At last a man
from one of the northern settlements came down to visit some
relatives in that neighborhood. When he arrived they made a feast
for him, but had only corn and beans, and excused themselves for
having no meat because the hunters were afraid to go into the
mountains. He asked the reason, and when they told him he said he
would go himself to-morrow and either bring in a deer or find the
Ustû'tlï. They tried to dissuade him from it, but as he insisted
upon going they warned him that if he heard a fawn bleat in the
thicket he must run at once and if the snake came after him he must
not try to run down the mountain, but along the side of the
ridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the morning he started out and went directly toward the
mountain. Working his way through the bushes at the base, he
suddenly heard a fawn bleat in front. He guessed at once that it
was the Ustû'tlï, but he had made up his mind to see it, so he did
not turn back, but went straight forward, and there, sure enough,
was the monster, with its great head in the air, as high as the
pine branches, looking in every direction to discover a deer, or
maybe a man, for breakfast. It saw him and came at him at once,
moving in jerky strides, every one the length of a tree trunk,
holding its scaly head high above the bushes and bleating as it
came.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hunter was so badly frightened that he lost his wits entirely
and started to run directly up the mountain. The great snake came
after him, gaining half its length on him every time it took a
fresh grip with its fore feet, and would have caught the hunter
before he reached the top of the ridge, but that he suddenly
remembered the warning and changed his course to run along the
sides of the mountain. At once the snake began to lose ground, for
every time it raised itself up the weight of its body threw it out
of a straight line and made it fall a little lower down the side of
the ridge. It tried to recover itself, but now the hunter gained
and kept on until he turned the end of the ridge and left the snake
out of sight. Then he cautiously climbed to the top and looked over
and saw the Ustû'tlï still slowly working its way toward the
summit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He went down to the base of the mountain, opened his fire pouch,
and set fire to the grass and leaves. Soon the fire ran all around
the mountain and began to climb upward. When the great snake
smelled the smoke and saw the flames coming it forgot all about the
hunter and turned to make all speed for a high cliff near the
summit. It reached the rock and got upon it, but the fire followed
and can ht the dead pines about the base of the cliff until the
heat made the Ustû'tlï's scales crack. Taking a close grip of the
rock with its hind feet it raised its body and put forth all its
strength in an effort to spring across the wall of fire that
surrounded it, but the smoke choked it and its hold loosened and it
fell among the blazing pine trunks and lay there until it was
burned to ashes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden near a small boat launch on the Tennessee
River. You are looking for a sandwich sized Lock&amp;Lock. I can't
remember if I put a pen in it or not but there is a log, I
promise!&lt;/p&gt;

This is an excellent &quot;Southern Rock&quot; song that came out in 1975. Great lyrics and killer guitar, man the 70's were great!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the song is not about marijuana, but about deceased rock and roll luminaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Green grass and high tides forever&lt;br/&gt;Castles of stone, soul and glory&lt;br/&gt;Lost faces say we adore you&lt;br/&gt;As kings and queens bow and play for you&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be in a part of Lenoir City Park that's not used that much any more but still a popular place to fish so use stealth please when looking for the keyholder.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">WHAT'S IN A NUMBER?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 2, 2010, a perfect game was thrown by Armando Galarraga of the Detroit Tigers but the perfect game will never be in the record books because of an extremely bad call by umpire Jim Joyce. After getting 26 straight batters out and needing only one more out, rookie Jason Donald hit a ground ball to first for the final out. Well, we thought it was the final out but umpire Joyce called the runner safe. Replay shows the runner being out by at least a step and a half! 99.9% of us would have yelled and screamed at the umpire but not Galarraga. He scrugged it off, got the next guy out and ended the game, not blaming anybody for what got taken away from him. With all the bad eggs in pro sports today this is one young man that is truly a professional and a role model for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find his number and you will find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***JUST A NOTE***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods that don't get found that often, go find them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks and HAPPY CACHING!</groundspeak:long_description>

After using it on about 80-somehting caches, I was informed that the ink bleeds off the page when the log got wet. Sooooo, after a lot of checking and rechecking of my gsak info, I left the house with a list in hand to go back and resign those caches.

Every trip out here has been at night but someday I'd like to come back in daylight to enjoy the area as well as more caching. Thanks for placing caches for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

Can't believe this one hadn't been found in over a year, but worked for us to log into the Ninetimes's Lonely Tennessee Cache Challenge (GC2TVKZ). Also, was great to add another find for the series. Log was wet, so added additional log in new baggie. As always, Team G, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

The coordinates take you to the entrance of Cave Creek Cave. The cache is located about 10ft inside. The cave goes back several hundred feet but unless you're experienced, I would not recommend exploring it. This cave is located right next to the road and there is a very small area to park. You seek a Lock&amp;Lock container.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Enter cave at large flat rock. About 10 ft in on your left you will find a rock self. Cache is hidden behind a couple of rocks.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to The
Appalachian Quilt Trail. This is the Loudon County segment of the
trail. This segment is so new the brochure isn't out yet! When I
get more details on these quilt squares I will update the cache
page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The square you see here is the Mariners Compass. This is located at
the Loudon County Welcome Center on Hwy 321 North or should I say,
&quot;The Lakeway to the Smokies&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You seek an ammo can full of goodies. Management and employees of
the visitor center know about the cache and look forward to
watching you find the cache. The visitors center is open Mon-Sat
from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. If you find the cache during those hours,
please go inside and say hi. You may thank them for being cacher
friendly and also sign their guest book.</groundspeak:long_description>

This was our last stop before home and it was dark and on a Sunday night so we didn't get to drop in and talk to the good folks there; though, we have visited there before we got into caching. Took one of the flyers and briefly checked out the &quot;alternative/additional&quot; option and may see you there. (Team Geologynut, if you didn't place the fliers there and don't know what I'm talking about, feel free to email me about them.)

Included a Team Semper Questio '08 pathtag for anyone that collects such. PLEASE conceal well as there can be extensive muggle traffic around the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a nice little public park. It has a playground for children, and a walking area. There is also a nice view of sailboats at Concord Yacht Club, across the water. The cache will require some stealth due to people walking around all the time. </groundspeak:long_description>

The mini league is playing baseball. These are the smallest baseball players ever! I am guessing they are under 3 years of age. They can hardly walk, let alone run. Great to watch (the parents...)

Cache found quickly; at 30ft off GZ coordinates.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Knox County Appalachian Quilt Trail is part of a larger quilt trail stretching through the Appalachian region made up of outdoor replications of quilt blocks on outbuildings. The purpose of the Appalachian Quilt Trail is to stimulate economic development through tourism in rural areas and increase sales of local arts., produce, value added products, accommodations and amenities. The project is being coordinated by Rural Conservation and Development Districts throughout the Appalachian region, supported by groups such as the East Tennessee Foundation and Knox County Parks and Recreation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knox County is part of the Smoky Mountain Resource Conservation and Development Council and is developing four loops starting in downtown Knoxville that circle out to the rural areas to cross one of the four major rivers that flow through Knox County; the French Broad, the Holston, the Clinch, and the Tennessee River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This quilt block is in honor of Carl A Cowan. Attorney, volunteer, community activist, Carl Cowan was known as a pioneer for his efforts in encouraging church, civic and professional groups to join together to peacefully integrate Knox County. Carl Cowan was successful in initiating new services for minority Knox County citizens including this park, which is named in his honor.(info was taken from monument)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, to find this easy 2 stage multi, at the listed coords, find his age at death. Be careful because on one side of the monument you find a way of determining his age but on the other side of the monument you find a more detailed way of determining his age at death. Call this 2 digit number XY. Now fill in the blanks-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N35 51.0XY&lt;br/&gt;W084 05.598&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final stage is an ammo can in the woods. Stealth will be needed most of the time.</groundspeak:long_description>

To solve this puzzle cache, I'll introduce you to some famous Tennesseans and you'll do a little research to figure the coordinates out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates are 35 5A.BCD 084 1E.FGH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Justin Timberlake (genre: pop, r&amp;b) was born in Memphis, TN on A/31/1981&lt;br/&gt;Gregg Allman (genre: rock, southern rock) was born in Nashville, TN on 12/8/194B&lt;br/&gt;Josey Scott (Saliva)(genre: metal) was born in Memphis, TN on 5/3/19C2&lt;br/&gt;Lester Flatt (genre: bluegrass) was born in Duncan's Chapel, TN on 6/D9/1914&lt;br/&gt;Aretha Franklin (genre: pop, r&amp;b) was born in Memphis, TN on E/25/1942&lt;br/&gt;Issac Hayes (genre: r&amp;b) was born in Covington, TN on 9/2F/1942)&lt;br/&gt;Tina Turner (genre: pop, r&amp;b) was born in Nutbush, TN on 1G/26/1939&lt;br/&gt;Kenny Chesney (genre: country) was born in Knoxville, TN on 3/2H/1968&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you figure out this easy puzzle, you'll be on your way to finding a .30 cal ammo can with some new and used cd's in it. There are two ways to find this cache, (1) You can park in a large, well lit parking lot with a short walk on fairly level terrain or (2) You can park on the side of a major highway, bushwack through some thick woods while cussing me the whole time, your choice!</groundspeak:long_description>

Took Barenaked Ladies cd (one of the few we don't have) and left one of our favorites -- Lyle Lovett's Joshua, Judges, Ruth to try to introduce someone else to his wonderful songs and sound. Adding this one to our favorites. TFTC!

&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a very bland description to an interesting cache... BUT, as we were hiding the cache, a car pulled up, then another. Several folks jumped out of the cars wearing quite nice attire to be hanging out in the woods, completely oblivious to us. We hid the cache and peered through the trees to see what they were doing. It became obvious to us quickly that they were spreading the ashes of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ventured closer, were spotted and they invited us into the circle. It turns out that dad/granddad/uncle/brother had died in Australia and requested that his body be shipped back here, cremated and spread at his favorite fishing hole where he had caught his largest bass. We were very honored to have been asked to participate in the proceedings even though we had never seen these people before. We shook hands w/all of the family but, regrettably because we were caught up in the moment, never got the man's name or we would have named this cache after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they told us the story, Mr. Fogie wondered if he had ever crossed paths w/ this gentleman before; Mr. Fogie likes to fish there as well and has met many folks over the years. Had we fished together? Shared tackle? Swapped stories?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were quite honored to share the experience with them, and Mr. Fogie will never fish there again without thinking about the &quot;friend&quot; he never knew, but is there with him nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the cache, look hard before posting a &quot;maintenance&quot; log. But we promise it IS at the end of the guard rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you're there, pay homage to the fisherman that spent many hours there and decided it was his favorite spot; favorite enough to be immortalized there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;
Ol'Fogies&lt;/p&gt;

BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden at the place where George Watson had his country grocery store for many years.&lt;br/&gt;When I was growing up, sometimes we would walk from the Jct. to here to buy candy. You can still see the block wall where the porch was. We used to sit out on that porch and watch the cars go by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George and Eula Watson lived in the back of the store. You can still see the concrete foundation of their living quarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can't remember if they died and the property was sold or if they just sold it and moved when they got older. It later became a TV repair shop, then sat empty for many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DOT came in and took the property for right-of-way and now all you see is the old foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and be stealthy.</groundspeak:long_description>

The place you are visiting used to be the Watt property. If you look down toward the creek, you will still see the bridge the Watt family used to cross to get to their house. It doesn't look like much now, but it was strong strong enough to hold cars and trucks when the family lived here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When it snowed, we would come here to sled down the hill. The hill was straight then. No retention pond was there. In fact, where the retention pond is now is exactly where the Watt house once stood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

As with most of the area, urban sprawl is taking over and the families who lived here are selling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Enjoy the hunt!

This was one of the 206 caches GRANPA ALEX and I found during a single 24 hour day on July 3, 2009.

Thanks for the hunt!</groundspeak:text>

This was find number 25 of 38 caches I found this weekend.  This was by far my most favorite cache of the Geoquest.  It combined a lot of my favorites all in one.  It's an Ammo can cache, there is telephone stuff here, there's a nice water feature here, and something historical.  What a great cache placement!  One of our team members looked in the spot and missed the cache. Then, a few minutes later, I was being nosy and spotted the cache!  Thanks for the fun!  </groundspeak:text>

That being said, watch your step while going after this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for an 8 oz., cammoed lock-n-lock. Has room for small trade items and contained a handheld casino game for the first to find, which was then replaced w/ some small swag items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park on a pretty quiet side street very near the coordinates. Embankment may be slippery after rain. Dog walkers and children playing could cause the need for stealth at times. Enjoy and happy hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;A substation is a high-voltage electric system facility. It is used to switch generators, equipment, and circuits or lines in and out of a system. It also is used to change AC voltages from one level to another, and/or change alternating current to direct current or direct current to alternating current. Some substations are small with little more than a transformer and associated switches. Others are very large with several transformers and dozens of switches and other equipment. There are three aspects to substations: 1) Path In, 2) Path Through and 3) Path Out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another function of substations is to provide an area for hiding geocaches. In this particular instance, you're looking for a film canister hidden near, but not inside the protection of, an LCUB substation. Parking is plentiful and you should go completely unnoticed by anyone unless an LCUB vehicle is there at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log only, byop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;

Take a short hike on this trail to find a large (5 gallon water cooler) cache camo painted and chained to a tree. This cache has some nice items in it to start so please trade up or at least trade even. Starting items include;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

an almost new rollerball mouse for laptop several 8x10 NASCAR driver photos a PS2 game a label maker (no batteries or label) a Smokies starter kit (maps and info) lots of software for PC and a whole lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The cache is chained to a tree so if you uncover the BRIGHT YELLOW lock, please cover it back up. Stealth shouldn't be to much of an issue but use your head. There are two parking areas for this trail. For this cache, the upper parking is closest.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a 3 1/2 by 3 1/2 square, tupperware container hidden next to a cool cave. A lot of people come to Melton Hill and never know this little gem is here. You don't have to go into the cave to get this cache. Right now the cave is flooded but I have been in it before when it was dry. The 3.5 terrain rating is because unless you're over 7 feet tall, you'll have to do a little rock climbing. No special equipment needed just be careful. You will also cross a slippery, dry creek bed.

You are looking for a 1.5 quart rubbermaid container with a locking top. Container is waterproof and airtight if the top is put back on correctly (hint hint).  There is a log and pen. There's a lot of tree cover so the best read I could get was with 25' accuracy so I will tell you that it's on the left side of the trail about 20 or so feet off trail. No need to do any bushwacking, just wait till you find somewhat of a clearing. If I tell you anymore I might as well be holding your hand!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in Campbell Station Park. Paved walkway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You are looking for a 1.9 quart Rubbermaid container with a locking top. Container is waterproof and airtight if the top is put back on right (hint,hint). I rated it a difficulty rating of 2 because there are a lot of places where this could be hidden. Coordinates are great but you'll still have to search a little. There is an Envelope marked FTF. The FTF can take this envelope which contains a $5 Wal-Mart card and an unactivated Travel Bug set. Besides the FTF envelope, starting contents are; glow stick, Eeyore toy, Tigger toy, Purina Beggin Chew for your best friend, and Mr. Germania Travel Bug. I walk this park everyday after work. If you get there before 5:00 PM you'll have the park to yourself most of the time. If you come after 5:00 PM the place is sometimes packed!! The trail that this is on opens at 8:30AM and closes at dusk (So the sign says!). Stealth may be needed!

Nice walk. Great hint... ahum. Had to sit down for a minute to let a couple of mugles pass by, and saw it from the sitting position. GZ was &quot; a bit&quot; off.

As Mr. Fogie was signing the log, Mrs. Fogie spotted the original container w/ wet log still inside. Debated protocol here for a few minutes as to leave it or return it to the CO. Decided to leave it there, but will be back in the area soon if owner would like for us to retrieve the original container/log.

Probably our first and last time to find the same cache twice in the same hunt! TFTC, Team G!</groundspeak:text>

A couple of years ago, I bought her a new minivan because of our expanding family. After I bought it for her I started making fun of her calling her soccer mom. She hated that! She is no soccer mom, just a good ole country girl. I felt this location fit her first cache placement. You'll understand the title when you get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You are looking for a container about the size of a 35mm with log only, BYOP.

Gave it about an hour but decided we were defeated for today and came to one of three conclusions: 1) It's been muggled, 2) It's even more evil than we gave it credit for (more likely), or 3) We suck at this (most likely).

But, our search did turn up information about a different pipkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pipkin is an earthenware cooking pot used for cooking over direct heat from coals or a wood fire. It has a handle and three feet. Late medieval and postmedieval pipkins had a hollow handle in order to insert a stick in it for manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the South Pacific Ocean. The main (largest and most populous) island is Tutuila, with the Manu?a Islands, Rose Atoll, and Swains Island also included in the territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

A couple of quick, interesting facts is that about 30 people from here (whether born here or having family from here) play in the NFL. My favorite NFL player Troy Polamalu, though born in the US has these people's blood in his veins. Many pro wrestlers come from here too! The zipcode here is 96799.

Sooooo, after a lot of checking and rechecking of my gsak info, I left the house with a list in hand to go back and resign those caches.

Every trip out here has been at night but someday I'd like to come back in daylight to enjoy the area as well as more caching. Thanks for placing caches for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

Trying to keep our streak going (this only made day 24 but OUR best streak nonetheless) and getting tougher finding some close enough to make it worth the trip when we only have time to grab one or two. Also get to scratch another one off in the series. Thanks for another great hide, Team G!</groundspeak:text>

none... yet

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We turned on the tube. Even w/ hundreds of channels,
there just wasn't anything on that grabbed our attention. So, we
decided to take the entertainment to our cable provider by planting
a cache there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a simple park and grab, though not overly
obvious. It is not in a busy area, but stealth may be required at
times if workers are around. Cache contains log only, so byop. And
tweezers are probably a good idea as well. Happy
hunting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;Archimedes Was A Principled Man&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Easy, easy find - that's not the point...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archimedes was born around 300BC and lived most of his life in Syracuse in Sicily. Very little is known about him or his life, but he may have spent some time in Alexandria, Egypt, and certainly communicated regularly with the great scholars of that city. His work in mathematics, technology, physics and astronomy earned him a great reputation both in his own time and beyond, and he is certainly considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of pi. He also defined the screw pump bearing his name (the “Archimedes Screw”, a method of elevating water efficiently), formulae for the volumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing infinitely large numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among his advances in physics are the foundations of hydrostatics, statistics and an explanation of the principle of the lever. He also described the principles of leverage in mathematical terms, and realized the full potential of the device. He is quoted as saying of the lever: “Give me somewhere to stand and I can move the Earth.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He is credited with designing innovative machines, and part of his notoriety during his lifetime was earned from his development of machines of war, which successfully helped Syracuse defend itself during attack from the Romans. The most famous of these machines, “Archimedes’ Claw”, was a counterweighted lever with a grappling hook on one end: this machine was used to seize the bows of the Roman ships and hoist them into the air. When the boats were suddenly released, they would often be sunk immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eureka!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Eureka!&quot; is the expression supposedly used by Archimedes when he discovered his most famous principle. The story goes that he had been asked by his king, Heiron II of Syracuse, to determine whether a gold crown he had commissioned was made of pure gold. Or had the goldsmith pulled a fast one, and diluted the gold with silver? The crown was sacred, and so could not be destroyed, so how to find out if it was pure gold or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allegedly the answer came to Archimedes as he enjoyed a common daily ritual. So delighted was he with the idea that came to him, he ran through the streets, naked, shouting the immortal word, which means “I have it!” What he had discovered later became called &quot;Archimedes’ Principle&quot;. History does not relate whether the goldsmith was cheating the king or not, and what happened to him if he was, but the discovery has lived on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Such intellect and yet he still forgot to get dressed before streaking down the streets of Syracuse... or so legend has it - Eureka!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archimedes died during the second Roman attack on his home city. When the enemy ransacked the city after its fall, an unnamed soldier killed Archimedes whilst he was working despite orders that he should not be harmed. Archimedes is said to have instructed the soldier to “leave my circles alone!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you've found the cache location - now how do you retrieve it from its hiding spot? You'll need to think like Archimedes in order to solve this cache, which is hidden in plain view!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no need to dismantle the cache holder and attempts to do so will not be logged. So, to avoid the need for multiple visits, it is highly recommended that you decode the hint and prepare appropriately. We can't forbid PAFs, but you'll enjoy the find much more if you figure it out for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;
Ol'Fogies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is a micro so BYOP. If you have found one of these cache containers it will be a simple find. If there is a game going on, good luck!! There are park hours on the entrance sign so please observe them. I think it's 7:00 AM to 9:30 PM. The cache is not in the ball field.

Forget about the numbers for a second and actually get out of the car to grab a cache. Who knows, you may enjoy the area as much as I did and decide to place a cache out here yourself!! There is a silver dime for the FTF. BYOP as there is just a log and an FTF prize.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This
&lt;i&gt;WAS&lt;/i&gt; our tailgate spot for football games at nearby UK
Commonwealth Stadium from 1994 until 2005, but they paved paradise
and put up a parking lot! Back then this area was full of mature
oak trees, not lamp posts and blacktop. And squirrels would pepper
us with acorn shells as we tossed the corn bags. Good times. I'm
happy to keep this cache online for the 2003,
2004, 2005,
2006, 2007,
2008, 2009,
2010, 2011 season and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;
It's
just a key-card away from being a drive-up and an excellent night
cache for obvious reasons (it apparently moves from LP to LP
depending on muggles).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Barton Warren Stone&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therestorationmovement.com/stone,bw.htm&quot;&gt;LINK:
Biography of BARTON WARREN STONE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barton Warren Stone was an Ordained Presbyterian minister and
is credited with founding the Christian Church (see link
above).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barton Warren Stone died at Hannibal, Mo., in November, 1844.
He was buried at Cane Ridge, Ky. A marble monument bearing this
inscription marks the spot:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The church of Christ at Cane Ridge and other
generous friends in Kentucky have caused this monument to be
erected as a tribute of affection and gratitude to Barton W. Stone,
minister of the gospel of Christ and the distinguished reformer of
the nineteenth century. Born December 24, 1772: died November 9,
1844. His remains lie here. This monument erected in
1847.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barton Stone's older cousin, Thomas Stone, signed the
Declaration of Independence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Barton Warren Stone was my great+ uncle and I share his
name.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cane Ridge Meeting House&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therestorationmovement.com/caneridge.htm&quot;&gt;LINK: History
of CANE RIDGE MEETING HOUSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;The preserved Cane Ridge Meeting House, built in 1791, is
the largest one-room log structure in North America and is
preserved/protected inside a limestone superstructure (see link
above). There is a museum of related items located here as
well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The property closes at 5:00pm. Security is present.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cane Ridge was pioneered and named by Daniel Boone for the
vast stands of wild cane growing in the area. Cane is still present
in abundance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache, a camoed decon container, is placed with permission.
Please replace cap tightly. Enjoy the visit.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our favorite place to come
have some fun. They have great concerts on the weekends and the
food in nice also. If you are in a gaming mode, they will help you
there also with the casino riverboat with all the games and
slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo'd
waterproof match container in the front park. It is well hid in the
hedge behind a bench. So be stealthily while going after this one.
A 2.5 because of the placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the casino and
cache..........'Rubicon' Wooly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE.....Follow your GPS'r and
then the hint you will be fine. Belterra knows the cache is there,
but if mess too much in the bushes, they will visit
you............


Have Fun...both at the casino and caching!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache is there (OR close nearby) and up and running

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache is there (OR close nearby) and up and running

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

Per their website the trail is 2.3 miles long with 70% single track (mountain bike speak) with 58 feet of elevation change.  They rate it as easy and I would tend to agree.  When I rode it the trail was bone dry, but I’ve read online warnings about how bad the trail can be for bikes when even slightly wet.  You can, of course, hike on this trial as well.  Parking for all 3 mountain bike trails is available at:  N39 00.408 W84 08.526.  With the tree cover I’ll tend to give extensive hints to guide you to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache is there (OR close nearby) and up and running

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache is there (OR close nearby) and up and running

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

It is ride-able for most but the beginner may find themselves walking a few areas. This section of trail is ~2.5 miles. There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.  Compared to the other 2 tails the margin for error is less and the consequences greater (steep hills!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking at both ends  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N39 00.408 W84 08.526&lt;br/&gt;N 39 0.859, W 84 8.304&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also ride you bike between the two parking places via roads as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache is there (OR close nearby) and up and running

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

&lt;b&gt;Confluence of
the Ohio and Licking Rivers&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The posted
coordinates will take you to an overlook at General James Taylor
Park at Newport, Kentucky (image above). There before you is the
confluence of the Licking and Ohio
rivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

as viewed from the 4th Street bridge pedway in Newport,KY.
&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What is a &lt;b&gt;CONFLUENCE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Confluence&lt;/b&gt;, in geography, describes &lt;i&gt;the meeting of two or
more bodies of water.&lt;/i&gt; It usually refers to the point where a
tributary joins a more major river, called the mainstem, when that
major river is also the highest order stream in the drainage
basin.
&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Licking River&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Licking River&lt;/b&gt; is a tributary of the Ohio River,
approximately 320 mi long in northeastern Kentucky in the United
States. The river and its tributaries drain much of the region of
northeastern Kentucky between the watersheds of the Kentucky River
to the west and the Big Sandy River to the east. The Licking River
rises in the Cumberland Plateau of eastern Kentucky, in
southeastern Magoffin County. It flows northwest in a highly
meandering course past Salyersville and West Liberty. In Rowan
County in the Daniel Boone National Forest it is impounded to form
the large Cave Run Lake reservoir. Northwest of the reservoir it
receives Fleming Creek approximately 8 mi northwest of Carlisle and
flows across the Bluegrass region of northern Kentucky. It receives
the North Fork from the east approximately 10 mi northwest of Mount
Olivet and the South Fork from the south at Falmouth. It joins the
Ohio opposite Cincinnati, Ohio, where it separates the cities of
Covington and Newport.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ohio River&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Ohio River&lt;/b&gt; is the largest tributary by volume of the
Mississippi River. It is approximately 981 miles long and is
located in the eastern United States. The river had great
significance in the history of the Native Americans. It was a
primary transportation route during the westward expansion of the
early U.S. It flows through or along the border of six states, and
its watershed encompasses 14 states, including many of the states
of the southeastern U.S.&lt;br /&gt;
The Ohio River is young from a geologic standpoint. The river
formed on a piecemeal basis beginning between 2.5 and 3 million
years ago. The earliest Ice Ages occurred at this time and dammed
portions of north flowing rivers. The Teays River was the largest
of these rivers, and the modern Ohio River flows within segments of
the ancient Teays. The ancient rivers were rearranged or consumed
by glaciers and lakes.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

________________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To log this earthcache, take a photo of yourself &lt;i&gt;or your
GPSr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the posted coordinates on the Newport Riverwalk
overlook with the confluence in the background (my photo above
right was washed out by glare, but the confluence is out
there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;________________________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And, to demonstrate the educational value of the
Earthcache,email the answers to these three questions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. What is the larger of the two streams of a confluence
called?&lt;br /&gt;
2. Determine &lt;i&gt;FLOW RATES&lt;/i&gt; for the two rivers in feet per
second (FPS). This may be accomplished by measuring a distance
along each of the river banks, floating an object from your
starting point to the ending point, and recording the time it takes
the object to float the distance. Once the &lt;i&gt;distance&lt;/i&gt;
and&lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; are determined, calculate the FPS for each waterway.
You may be surprised. &lt;b&gt;If there is no current just say so and
pass on this exercise.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. At the base of the &lt;b&gt;From Newport&lt;/b&gt; ironwork is an inscribed
tile in the walkway (above center) which reads, &lt;b&gt;'The valleys,
plains and salt licks of Kentucky have attracted human settlement
for at least&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;blank&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;years&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;How many?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________

&lt;br /&gt;
Please
email your answers to :
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do
not wait on a reply from me. FOUND IT logs which do not meet
requirements will be quietly deleted.&lt;br /&gt;

Greetings from nj

Came back this morning to collect addition information and to take better pictures.  Second day of adventuree starts on the NJ-PA-OH-KY-OH-IN-IL-WI trip.

I enjoyed this earthcache and enjoyed thinking about the answers.


This place is a lot quieter in the morning!


Cheers!</groundspeak:text>

He's a miniture poodle we got from the Sharonville SPCA.  This is the first dog any of us has every owned and now I know what they mean when people write that their dog was their &quot;constant companion&quot;!  He is a &quot;people&quot; dog and will follow you anywhere (better close that bathroom door!)  He's a great dog and we were very lucky to find him at the shelter.  Only only bad habit he has is trying to sneak outside to have at the chipmunks and squirrels in the neghborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is his favorite park because of the dog park here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are interested in adopting a dog or cat - you can contact me and I can ask my daughter to keep and eye out for any particular breed - she volunteers at the SPCA.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The coordinates above are where you can park in the northbound curb
lane of Central Parkway (except 4-6 weekdays). It is very near the
cache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true! Cincinnati started building a subway in the 1920’s
but abandoned the concept shortly afterwards. Mostly what is left
are the tunnels. This cache brings you to a place to view the
entrance of two of the tunnels. The puzzle is easy with the answers
on the related website above or pick
HERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You cannot approach the tunnels or enter them. They are
fenced off by the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did construction start on the subway? 192B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did construction stop? 19Z5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long was the system going to be? C6 miles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many miles of track were laid? X&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many subway cars were ordered? Y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big was the 1916 bond issue? $A million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on

Geochecker.com. Summer 2009 update: Just wanted to pass along
the fact that once a year the Cincinnati Muesum Center does a short
hike through part of the subway. I went this year - pretty neat!

It measures about 1/3 mile in length with a 19ft. bore and originally served two narrow gauge tracks but was later converted to single track standard gauge. The north portal is located under the NE corner of Oak St. and May St., two blocks east of Bethesda Hospital and just east of I-71. The tunnel's south portal emerges in a cut between William Howard Taft and McMillan St., parallel to the N 71 entrance ramp. There is a short underpass of identical brick construction under McMillan St. just south of the southern tunnel portal which is visible from I-71 during the winter months. The south approach to the tunnel parallel to I-71 ascended a 3.4% grade but the tunnel itself is level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1920's this line reportedly generated more freight in a five mile stretch than any other in the Cincinnati area. One 1927 proposal called for construction of a double-track elevated line over the CL&amp;N for use by the Rapid Transit Loop, however the line would have had to diverge from the existing railroad alignment in the tunnel vicinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tunnel was still in operation when I-71 was constructed and until the late 1980's. Other remaining pieces of the line include a pair of bridges over I-71, one near the old Natural History Museum (now Channel 9) and the other just north of Blair Ave. and south of Victory Parkway. The wooden approaches of an overpass at Florence Ave. north of Dorchester also remain. The CL&amp;N right-of-way has been purchased by SORTA and part will almost certainly be used eventually by rail transit north of Dana Ave. What if any right-of-way between downtown and that point will be used is unclear.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is still some possibility that the tunnel will return to active status, as it and some remaining right-of-way have periodically been reconsidered as an alternate route for the downtown approach of a new light rail transit line. However the single track bottleneck may once again eliminate the tunnel from mass transit consideration, although for some time a single track arrangement on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge was considered for the I-71 line, so anything is possible.</groundspeak:long_description>

Bring pen to sign the log, and it is about a 10-15 minute hike from parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The easiest way to get to this cache is follow the paved walking trail past the concession stand straight back all the way to the end past the play ground.  At this spot, turn right, go straight, (you will pass &quot;Why is this Here?&quot; cache.  Take the path to the left, head all the way to the trees.  Walk through some grass to find the start of the dirt trail in the woods which leads to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:  500' south of this cache is a broad topographic high area that reportedly was created and used to supply fill materials during the construction of I-275.  The area is relatively void of trees and can be seen on Google maps as a broad circular feature surrounded by trees.  I wouldn't recommend walking that way because it might be private property. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lised on geocaching.com under same name.</groundspeak:long_description>

These will require zero bushwacking, but some stealth (especially with muggle hikers as the muggle bikers will tend to be zipping by and not take much notice) since portions of the trail can be quite popular and the caches will be located on the trail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note while the bike trail is open 24 hours some of the parking isn't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache with confidence - cache was place with permission of the Alan Ferguson, Park Manager, Cowan Lake Region - Ohio State Parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have yet to see any deer on the this portion of the trail (I have on the less travled northern sections), but in this location the fencing is lowered so it must be true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The grab can be made while on the trail.  You don't need to be wandering off the trail property to make the grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1Z9BV - Terrace Pl./New St. Public parking (24 hours)&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 09.980 W 084° 18.241&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PQ1Z9BV - Milford Parking (24 hours)&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 10.276 W 088° 17.982&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PX1Z9BV - Avoca Park parking (dawn to dusk)&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 08.356 W 084° 20.492</groundspeak:long_description>

Have fun trying to find the cache and reset the cache just as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's another cache at another marker (97) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?pf=&amp;guid=25967585-5fa1-4e73-8076-6745fed07b7e&amp;decrypt=y&amp;log=&amp;numlogs=&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's about, oh, 9 miles up the trail.... :-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1ZY1P - Terrace Pl./New St. Public parking (24 hours)&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 09.980 W 084° 18.241&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 09.980 W 084° 18.241</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A  sinkhole, also known as a sink, shake hole, swallow hole, or swallet is a natural depression or hole in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock, often both, by water. Sinkholes may vary in size from less than a meter to several hundred meters both in diameter and depth, and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. They may be formed gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide. These terms are often used interchangeably though many will distinguish between those features into which a surface stream flows and those which have no such input.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Mechanisms of formation may include the gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Sinkholes are usually but not always linked with karst landscapes. In such regions, there may be hundreds or even thousands of sinkholes in a small area so that the surface as seen from the air looks pock-marked, and there are no surface streams because all drainage occurs sub-surface.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia defines Karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock, usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite. [1]&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Due to subterranean drainage, there may be very limited surface water, even to the absence of all rivers and lakes. Many karst regions display distinctive surface features, with sinkholes or dolines being the most common. However, distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled, such as by glacial debris, or confined by a superimposed non-soluble rock strata. Some karst regions include thousands of caves, even though evidence of caves that are big enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log is there water in the sinkhole?</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Want to get into
geo-biking?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All you need is some info about riding trails and one answer is
the&lt;br /&gt;
Rails to Trail
Conservancy.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages trails
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the&lt;br /&gt;
best&amp;lt; site features for geocachers is the ability to download a
GPX&lt;br /&gt;
file&amp;lt; of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include
restrooms, parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the
trail itself can be downloaded into many software packages. For
instance you could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or
use the GPX file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to
export to your GPS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is accessible via the Little Miami Bike Trail Trail.
start geobiking!&lt;/p&gt;

I'll try to cache so so you can stop and check things out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tiny park dedicated to the history of Camp Dennison.  The camp was established during the Civil War as a training camp.  It was named after the governor of Ohio at the time.  Later it was turned in a hospital camp.  Morgan's raiders came near it, but avoided it thinking it was still a training camp.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park has a sign with more history, a cannon, and other signage.  If you are there on a Sunday stop by the Waldschmidt house.  He was a German-American vertern of the Civil war who moved here afterwards and started many businesses in the area.  His house and a small civil war museum are open ever Sunday 1-4.  It's worth and hour side trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a 35mm film canister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1ZY1W - Camp Dennison Parking (Dawn to Dusk)&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 11.422 W 084° 17.587</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Please rehide well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The historical house is just down the street.  My son and I went for a tour of it and the civil war museum they have there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 1794, Christian Waldschmidt, a veteran of the American Revolution, moved his family to a site on the Little Miami River and built a new community called New Germany. In 1804, he built his home, which included a store. Waldschmidt was a businessman and encouraged new settlement, staffing a church and helping to found a school, and beginning industries vital to the survival of his new home, such as Ohio's first paper mill, a cooperative distillery, woolen mill, sawmill, and a blacksmith shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Civil War, the house and surrounding grounds were part of Camp Dennison, used primarily as a general training center, recruiting depot, and hospital post, and named in honor of Governor William Dennison. The main house, now known as Waldschmidt House, served as the headquarters for General Joshua Bates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, the house fell into disuse and near ruin. In 1941, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Kroger of Cincinnati, who had purchased the property, gave the house to the Ohio Society Daughters of the American Revolution (OSDAR) and donated $5,000 to start the restoration. Immediately following WWII, OSDAR began the restoration. In 1953, the house was dedicated and opened to the public as a museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OSDAR purchased adjoining property including a smaller fieldstone house that Christian Waldschmidt built for his daughter when she married. This house was used as a guard house for Camp Dennison during the Civil War and was restored and opened as the Camp Dennison Civil War Museum in 1998. The Ohio Society continues to collect objects of interest to the period, as we establish this new museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1989, the Ohio Society completed the construction of a memorial museum barn honoring the Bicentennial of the Northwest Ordinance. It now houses an extensive collection of primitive stone cutting and farm tools, as well as a restored Conestoga wagon. The Memorial Barn is used for meetings and other programs of the Ohio Society DAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Christian Waldschmidt House is considered one of the best examples of Pennsylvania Dutch architecture west of the Allegehenies. Since opening, DAR members have researched and collected pieces of early Americana, and the furnishings include many original pieces used by the Waldschmidt family. Criteria for acceptance of items as gifts to the house are: 1) prior to 1831; 2) Civil War period relating to Camp Dennison; 3) any artifact belonging to Christian Waldschmidt or his descendants.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">These little suburban oasises deserve a cache too.  Most are wide open play fields with few places to hide and tend to be wide open and require some stealth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A lot has changed in this park since I was a boy - mostly for the better.  The artillery pieces are still there, but part of a very nice veterns memorial.  There's 2 groups of play sets now and and built in &quot;corn hole&quot; set.  The tiny pool was filled in years ago.  But I miss the suicidal monkey bars [banned from all parks since Bill Cosby's comedy albums :-) - albums, you know, the vinyl kind?], the 30 foot high slide, and a merry-go-around you could spin so fast you and your buddies could get dizzy - or go flying off of it! And &quot;Old Betsy&quot; (background) and antique firetruck you could play on, is replaced with a fire truck playset.  Oh well, times change.  Now the entire park is immaculate.  So well manicured it's hard to hide a cache.  I hope this hide survives.</groundspeak:long_description>

in Sycamore Township. It has been updated much since I was a kid:
Shelterhouse with a fireplace, all updated play equipment, and a
creek. It has it all. I do miss the old Patton tank they used to
have there, but it would look kind of out of place now. 
&lt;p&gt;I found the clues for this cache in the first chapter of a most
popular book a New American gave me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39 deg 13. [1:9] [45:11] [1:31]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;084 deg 23. [2:10] [8:4]&lt;/p&gt;

The are signs here telling the story.  Apparently, the money to bill this park came from the EPA pay-off when they forced Reading to close down their company and use CWW water system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However it got funded - it's a pleasant place to sit and eat your lunch on a sunny day.</groundspeak:long_description>

micro-park nestled next to an older subdivision of the same name.
Note: my GPS reception was a little iffy when hid - may need to use
hint and expand the search a little. &lt;br /&gt; As recently as 1996, this park had one of those 30 foot high
tort-magnet slides. Now a more liability-friendly one sits in it's
place. There's a playset here, basketball court, and tennis court.
While the park is for kiddies, the hide isn't. I'd suggest
approaching it from the south (= from below). 
&lt;p&gt;The final cache:&lt;/p&gt;

I felt feel to&lt;br/&gt;put this cache anywhere the far end solar system because Eris orbit&lt;br/&gt;ranges from 38 to 97 AU from the Sun.  Eris is called a plutoid or&lt;br/&gt;trans-Neptunian dwarf planet.  A number of these have been&lt;br/&gt;found: Seda, Orcus, Makemake, Haumea.  It is due to these other&lt;br/&gt;discoveries that it became apparent that Pluto fell into this&lt;br/&gt;family of object much better than the planets – hence&lt;br/&gt;it's &quot;demotion&quot; from planet status.&lt;br/&gt;This cache had to be a multi due to proximity of another cache. The final cache is at 1 of 3 places depending on what you see EAST of coordinates as you are standing there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you see nothing but trees the final is at: N39 38.141 W83 59.438&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If you see a HUGE &quot;No Hunting&quot; sign - the final is at: N39 38.073 W83 59.526&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If you see a long railing/fence - the final is at:N39 38.399 W83 59.129&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caches in the series are:&lt;br/&gt;Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM &lt;br/&gt;Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR &lt;br/&gt;Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV&lt;br/&gt;Earth   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKW&lt;br/&gt;Mars      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM1&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM3&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMA&lt;br/&gt;Saturn    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMD&lt;br/&gt;Uranus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMJ&lt;br/&gt;Neptune   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMM&lt;br/&gt;Pluto    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYNB&lt;br/&gt;And bonus caches&lt;br/&gt;Eris http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN7&lt;br/&gt;Comets http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN5&lt;br/&gt;Meteors   http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYN2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The goal is a cache that is convenient for Cincinnati commuters and interstate travelers.  So local tbugs/coins can go for long rides and some far away travelers might visit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I lucked out with this location.  It has it all: close to the highway interchange, off street parking, close to my home (so I can keep it stocked), and a muggle resistant hide for a decent size container.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much interesting at this site.  On the east side of the highway there's a neat spot and a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache belongs behind the tree, against the fence under the geopile. There's a short and easy geo-trail in. Please replace as you find it!</groundspeak:long_description>

I once found the cache in the open, but all seemed OK.  Every time I check on it though, it is not well hidden.  So I moved a little south.  Upgraded the container (ammo can) and hid better.  I've marked every TB not in the cache as of today as &quot;missing&quot; they may not have been logged by someone who grabbed them.  Please rehide well - I'm concerned about a serial muggling.</groundspeak:text>

It wasn't muggled, but just misplaced.  The cache belongs behind the tree, against the fence under the geopile.  There's a short and easy geo-trail in.  Please replace as you find it!</groundspeak:text>

I understand paper not sure about the paperless yet I got a venn diagram on the map has circles around my location, my home, my destination and it beeps at me,when i get close gotta set the circle size dont know how close i came didnt see a lake.
may have missed by 1/4 mile or so looking at the little map on the page here .......................when i cant find it on the qps map its about 6 feet( naut/1000)</groundspeak:text>

It has easy access for commuters and interstate travelers to drop off and pick up trackables. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's easy access through the honeysuckle about 30' north of GZ.</groundspeak:long_description>

PC3PC4 wants to make it to Germany and MR8A6T wants to go to amuement park roller coasters (maybe north toward Cedar Point or south towards 6 Flags in Lexington.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The highest part of this park overlooks the Mill Creek valley.  It's a beautiful view - bring your camera!  This is a multi-puzzle hybrid.  A 3 part multi-stage would COULD take as little as a 1/2 hour from finding the 1st stage to back on the road. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; NOTE:  I have added another style of key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates above are the first stage.  A small container with some keys in it.  The keys hold the clues to the second and third stages.  (You do not have to do the stages in order.  There is no clue at stage 2 to help with stage 3.)   All 3 caches are in the same park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2 is located at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 39 15. _ _ _&lt;br/&gt;W 084  24._ _ _&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the key gives you the last six numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 3 : The key gives you the clues for this stage as well.  These clues are more graphical in nature versus numerical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: there are 2 keys in the 1st stage to minimize the chance that you show up and some one else has &quot;checked out&quot; the key and is busy using it.  If both are checked out, you might want to wait 5 minutes and they should be back.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: You CANNOT read the keys with the device you would normally use to write to them. There are at least two places within 1/4 mile (5 minute drive) where the keys can be used - one is open 24 hrs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: AV1HZTQ - Stage 3&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: QQ1HZTQ - Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were going after some other cache n out caches in the Sharonville area and swang over here since this one looked interesting as well! What a creative geocache! After grabbing the first stage, we met a curious sheriff from the nearby sheriff's office. He didn't know what geocaching was and seemed to think we were idiots to be out here at 4am to do this. *shrugs* He didn't really tell us to leave, only asked where our car was. We went back to the car and went after some park and grabs and then came back. We dropped Meggorie off at the first stage to return the container with the keys (We knew we probably shouldn't take the container, but at 4am on Christmas Eve, who else would be crazy enough to be out and about caching!?) and Capness and I attacked the final stage. Didn't take too long, but I'm glad that I had my gloves on! Thanks for a super creative geocache. I really enjoyed myself here!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Deleted a couple of DNF logs.  They DID find stage 1, but declined to finish the multi for their own reasons.  That isn't a DNF - that's a DNA  Did Not Attempt.  Those should be logged as a &quot;note&quot;.  The cache stages are in fine shape.

Updated:  Well these two seem intent on logging a &quot;DNF&quot;.  Using their logic I could come to a tall tree hide - not be able to see the cache up in the tree - not being willing to &quot;risk&quot; climbing it - and log a DNF.  Or a puzzle that is too hard that I didn't want to do or felt it was &quot;dangerous&quot; - DNF.

In my book DNF means you were at the coordinates of where the final was (or at least where you think it is), looked and couldn't find it - implying possibly its gone. 

All the cache stages are fine.

I now have 2 smaller varmit resistant containers there with the coordinates of the final.  I replaced the final container too and replaced the log, since they  got wet.  To prime the pump I've place a prize at the final.  PLEASE, only new finders.  You'll have to contact me in order to activate it.</groundspeak:text>

The forst stage gives to clues to the final too.  The stage in the woods is the one that affords you the best view of the valley below (that's the point - hence the name....)</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Checked on the keys.  They are fine, but the issue is that the device that you would normally write data to a key cannot read the data on the key.  You must bring it somewhere to read the key.  There is a place nearby.  I'm dropping the difficulty on this one by adding more hints in the listing.</groundspeak:text>

of. It’s so well hidden that it hasn’t been cached yet. The Shuff
family have many graves here dating back to the civil war. To the
west is the start of a long stretch of greenspace surrounding a
creek. &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;CHANGED
10/30/2008  - New hide
location (the old one was too easy, too small, and too out in the
open) and therefore new clues. Changes in RED.&lt;/p&gt;

entrance is across the street from 10692 Sharondale Road&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoyed exploring and collecting the clues. Bob slid in the mud twice and pretty much looked like a homeless person after that cache.

i came very close...
... looking here &quot;No one has logged an attempt to find this geocache yet.&quot;
but reading many logs from that other site gives me lotsa clues...
think maybe ill bring a leatherman and some woodscrews just in case.</groundspeak:text>

You only need 100 in a day twice to sign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are finished with the challenge simply log all your finds and make  bookmark(s) and than come grab this one or provide the date(s) you did the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not as hard as it sounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this cache isn't a 3.5/1.5, but finding 100 easy ones in one day will fell like it....</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This coordinates above bring you to Patriot
Pointe in Sharonville. 
There are clues there to give you coordinates at the final cache
and a trailhead.  The
final cache is within a short drive of Patriot Pointe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clues are on signs on the wall and
monuments on the area above and behind the
wall.  Note: I have
referred to some the coordinate numbers more than once – just in
case you (or I!) get one wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

This memorial is gorgeous and at night, even more so. It was a spectacular place to explore. The final stage was also a really neat place to explore. Thanks for a very well thought out geocache!</groundspeak:text>

They won't do you much good anyway.  The only way to locate the cache is knowing that it's in the third vertical tube when approaching from the West Trailhead while &quot;in&quot; the trail.  (From the East side you are on your own!) This tube is generally dry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain:&lt;br/&gt;Here's the details.  Might be soggy during rains. I think you are pretty much guaranteed to get wet (maybe up to your knees!)  There may be some debris to side step.   Flashlight required.  If you are tall you'll be bent over a good part of the way.  Is this fun or going too far?  You be the judge and log it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wouldn't do this alone and do follow all gc.com safety suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring writing instrument.  You may be able to open the cache and extract the log without detaching the cache.

&lt;p&gt;This coordinates above bring you to Patriot
Pointe in Sharonville. 
There are clues there to give you coordinates at the final cache
and a trailhead.  The
final cache is within a short drive of Patriot Pointe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clues are on signs on the wall and
monuments on the area above and behind the
wall.  Note: I have
referred to some the coordinate numbers more than once – just in
case you (or I!) get one wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located at the Sharonville Depot Square. There’s a
play train with fountain and an actual train caboose for the kids
to climb on. There are several restaurants nearby and soon the
Sharonville Fine Arts center. There’s a Sharonville Historical
Center 1 block away across from the Ameristop. There’s free public
parking behind Cliff’s Hardware. Busy area, so unless you are bold,
it’ll be best in the evening or weekends.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Also on Depot Square are round plaques detailing Sharonville
history. You’ll get the final coordinates from these plaques. The
first one is located near the caboose at coordinates listed above
and they run in front of Cliff’s Hardware. The clues below give the
missing numbers above (and below). Each plaque has a date listed on
the bottom (in parentheses below) as well as info in the text.
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is located at N 39 16.ABC W 084 24.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Henry Runyan purchased settled here around 1791.
(178D-17ZA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Adrian Hageman settles on how many acres? 8EY (1794)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The town of Sharon was started with 71 lots and F7 people
(18RX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Erie Canal was located just west of Sharon (18SD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Crescentville came into existence. By 189A there were 1B
houses. In 18Z7 there was a 2 -room school house. (18SX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Sharon began its railroad history. (187Q)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) When Sharon changed to “Sharonville” (187C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) Sharonville had a racetrack! (19RF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) Sharonville became a city when its population reached 5BEY
(19CQ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note I list the # multiple times in case you got a number
mistaken. You should get the same # twice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a micro cache in the area that contains a hint for
the final cache. It’s located at ( N 39 16.QRW W 084 24.XYZ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is within easy walking distance. The hint below is
for the micro cached hint. I tried to theme the cache with railroad
and Sharonville items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And no fair asking the ice cream lady where it is! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do your research online you can check it here.&lt;/p&gt;

She mentioned a couple of the early cachers asking her where the cache was (no fair!  [;)] ).  She knows where it is, but will probably charge you for a cone or coffee for the clue.

I derived my questions from this:&lt;br/&gt; http://rps3.com/Files/AGW/Rutan.AGWdataAnalysis%20v11.pdf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;…or are you getting warmer?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The coordinates above are bogus and maybe you’ll think this puzzle is too.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This puzzle merely requires answering questions about AGW (human caused global warming.)  Now we’ve all heard from the media how everything is melting, the polar bears are dying and we better do something about it.  Here’s a link to some info that might get you thinking about it.  It is compiled by Burt Rutan, aviation pioneer.  The question below can all be answered going to:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;http://rps3.com/Pages/Burt_Rutan_on_Climate_Change.htm&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The data can be found elsewhere, but this compilation is the best I’ve seen.  The basic questions are:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1)      Is the earth getting warmer?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2)      Are we humans causing it?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Question A:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Based on the UN/IPCC own data in presented in 1990, has it ever been warmer in the last 1000 years than it is now?  Has it ever been much cooler?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1)  Yes, Yes&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;2)  Yes, No&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3) No, Yes&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;4)  No, No&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Question B:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Has the RATE of warming ever  been as great as it is now?  And if so, when?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;7)  Nope, no way.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;8)  Yes,    300 BC – 200 BC&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;9) Yes,  1860 - 1880&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;0)  Yes,   1940- 1960&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Question C: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From 2002-2008 has it been getting warmer or cooler based on MSU and Hadley data?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;6)  No change&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;7)  Warmer&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;9)  Cooler&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Question D:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Based on the temperature data from the Vostok ice cores – what is the nature of the world’s climate in the past 400,000 years&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;6) Mostly ice ages with small warm periods in between&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;7)  Most moderate with occasionally ice ages&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;8)  Climate was about what it is now.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;9)   Generally, is was warmer than it is now&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Question E:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Global warming is supposed to have other atmospheric impact.

bridge, but it's nice (and easy). The bridge itself is on private
property, the cache is located on City of Sharonville
property.(Note: one of the houses on the hill is for sale. You
could drive across the bridge and do a &quot;drive by&quot; of the real
estate....) The cache is a park and grab camoflaged nano. You can
park on the side of the road and walk 10' to the hide. Watch for
the arrows on the &quot;No Parking&quot; signs, you can park between some,
and not between some others. (These spots go fast when Mass is on.)
There's a fair amount of traffic on the road, but the cache will
aid you in making a stealthy grab. People frequently park here, so
that won't seem unusal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Use the hint below if you are nervous about making a quick
stealthy grab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Per the publishers request, I'll mention that I have contacted the
nearby (2 blocks) school about the cache. The cache itself is
located on City of Sharonville Property and I have their explicit
permission to locate the cache here. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s the cache container&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes it’s the puzzle&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes it’s the hide&lt;br /&gt;
 This time it’s the location - so I want the hide and grab to be
easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE REPLACE THE CACHE EXACTLY WHERE YOU FOUND IT !!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It's a fake magnetic hollow bolt in the No Parking Sign (about midway up).</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

He has also turned me down for many a request too.

So many thanks to Matt - he is the hardest working geocache approver around! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Shaker Trace Trail.

Crosley Field was reconstructed by using the blueprints from the original stadium, including the same field dimensions, grass infield, the infamous outfield terrace, and the same dimensions, height, and angles of the outfield wall. To add to the authenticity of the reconstruction project, the 400+ seat stands on the 3rd baseline comprise of the original stadium seating from Crosley Field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoreboard was reconstructed to simulate the original scoreboard from Crosley when the &quot;last pitch&quot; was thrown on June 24, 1970. No detail was left out in the reconstruction process, including the original sponsors of the Reds and the scores from around the league at that time (see left).</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;
This
is a multi-cache going through little known trails in Sharon Woods
(the county park requires entry fee $3/day $5/year). The
coordinates above bring you to the first clue. There are developed
trails all back through here. This cache only touches a small
portion. There is really no bushwacking involved, but the some of
the later trails have some undergrowth - you might want long pants.
There are no physical caches until the final, all stages are
getting coordinates off signs/posts. BYO pencil/pen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE:
Areas around the trails are reservable. Please be considerate and
not wander into their parties (and mooch snacks!). Also the trail
isn't available from Mid-November through Jan
1st&lt;/b&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

STOP #1 At the coordinates listed above, there is a sign with 3
lines of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
xxxxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;

 xxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;
HIKERS PERMITTED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 A= # of letters in 2nd word top line&lt;br /&gt;
B= # of times the letter &quot;R&quot; 's in 2nd word top line&lt;br /&gt;
C= # of letters in the last word on the second line&lt;br /&gt;
D= # of times the letter &quot;T&quot; 's in the last word on the second
line&lt;br /&gt;
E= # of letters in the last word on the second line&lt;br /&gt;
F= # of vowels in the first word on the top line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Start
your trek to Stop #2 using the trailhead below - just south of
where you are now. You MIGHT be able to get to Stop #2 going up the
road, but the trail &quot;will make all the difference&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#2 is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N
16.ABC W 24.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Stop #2: Deer Exclusion Area:&lt;br /&gt;
There is a small sign here with a phone # on it to call for more
information on the area: (It's such a small fenced in area you
could ask what plants are in there they don't want the deer to
eat!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Phone
# :ABC-72FG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#3 is located at N 16.A(A+B+C)F W 24.(C-1)(G)(A-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#3 : Yellow Sign Post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On
this sign there are two phone #'s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OH:
ABC-DEFG&lt;br /&gt;
KY: QRS-TUVW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#4 is located at: N 16.GRA W 24.VBG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#4: Another Yellow Sign Post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This
stage has given people trouble so here goes... no tricks here - the
coordinates are posted ON the post. It's the same type of post as
the last stop with the telephone #. If the coordinates you get from
the last stage seem a little off - just continue to follow the
trail and look on any posts you see. Since I've gotten som much
feedback I've marked the coordinates of the final cache twice on
the post at the coordinates and also on the post across the road
from the coordinates. I hope this makes it do-able - it's not
supposed to be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoyed this one. Loved the hidey-hole. In fact, I gave it a Favorite Point on the other website.

&lt;p&gt;Want to get
into&lt;br /&gt;
geo-biking?  All you need is some info about riding trails
and&lt;br /&gt;
one answer is the Rails to Trail
Conservancy.  This&lt;br /&gt;
is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages
trails&lt;br /&gt;
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the
best&lt;br /&gt;
site features for geocachers is the ability to download a GPX
file&lt;br /&gt;
of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include
restrooms,&lt;br /&gt;
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail
itself&lt;br /&gt;
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance
you&lt;br /&gt;
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the
GPX&lt;br /&gt;
file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to export
to&lt;br /&gt;
your GPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join now and start&lt;br /&gt;
geobiking!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on the Shaker Trace bike trail at the Hamilton County Miami Whitewater Forest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I've found there are several accessories that can make geobiking nicer.  An extra water bottle holder is good.  (I do this trick where I freeze the water and gatorade - nothing like a cold drink on the trail...)  A GPS mount is essential.  I broke down and bought a rear bike rack and bad to hold repair tools, spare inner tube, pump, geocache containers, logs .....  :-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Shaker Trace Trail. This trail runs through the Hamilton County Park District’s Miami Whitewater Forest. There’s parking near N39 15.657 W84 44.686&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outer loop is 8 miles long&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2CBEW - GC2CBEW Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 15.639 W 084° 44.678&lt;br/&gt;N39 15.639 W84 44.678</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Want to get
into&lt;br /&gt;
geo-biking?  All you need is some info about riding trails
and&lt;br /&gt;
one answer is the &quot;http://www.railstotrails.org/index.html&quot;&amp;gt;Rails to
Trails&lt;br /&gt;
Conservancy.  This&lt;br /&gt;
is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages
trails&lt;br /&gt;
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the
best&lt;br /&gt;
site features for geocachers is the ability to download a GPX
file&lt;br /&gt;
of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include
restrooms,&lt;br /&gt;
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail
itself&lt;br /&gt;
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance
you&lt;br /&gt;
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the
GPX&lt;br /&gt;
file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to export
to&lt;br /&gt;
your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Dig up some history while you're caching. &lt;br /&gt; There are trails up to the cache. I added one trailhead below (head
towards cell phone tower to the left facing the hill). Or head to
the right towards the Trilobite sign. Or you can do a little light
bushwacking straight up the hill. Cache is near the trail.

The answer the Rails to Trails Conservency. 
http://www.railstotrails.org/index.html
You can join for free. There are many features to the website, but one of the best is the ability to download a GPX file of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include restrooms, parking etc. The &quot;track&quot; of the trial itself can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance you could do a PQ in GC.com with it. Or use the GPX file in GSAK to select caches along a bike trail to export to your GPS. Join now and start geobiking!

This park named &quot;Thornton&quot; reminded me of one of my favorite movies...The Quiet Man....starring John Wayne. Large Cache in honor of the Duke. Plenty of room for swag and travelers. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actor, John Wayne, played Sean Thornton who has returned from America to reclaim his homestead and escape his past. Sean's eye is caught by Mary Kate Danaher, a beautiful but poor maiden, and younger sister of ill-tempered &quot;Red&quot; Will Danaher. The riotous relationship that forms between Sean and Mary Kate, punctuated by Will's pugnacious attempts to keep them apart, form the main plot, with Sean's past as the dark undercurrent.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are large hubs of trails in Dayton and Xenia - old railroad hubs in the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I used to be able to occasionally ride my bike to work.  Wish we had a complete system of trails and areas on the side of roads like they do in other places.  Ah, maybe some day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Lebanon Countryside YMCA trail. This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail. There’s parking near either end. Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA. Near geocache GC235X5 .&lt;br/&gt;The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 . The trail is about 5 miles long. The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caches in the series are:&lt;br/&gt;Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM &lt;br/&gt;Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR &lt;br/&gt;Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV&lt;br/&gt;Earth   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKW&lt;br/&gt;Mars      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM1&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM3&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMA&lt;br/&gt;Saturn    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMD&lt;br/&gt;Uranus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMJ&lt;br/&gt;Neptune   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMM&lt;br/&gt;Pluto    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYNB&lt;br/&gt;And bonus caches&lt;br/&gt;Eris http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN7&lt;br/&gt;Comets http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN5&lt;br/&gt;Meteors   http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYN2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Only you can answer that question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the following quiz to help put your geocaching in perspective. If you end up answering &quot;yes&quot; to three or more questions, you may want to take a good look how your life is affected by geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Have you missed classes or work because of geocaching?&lt;br/&gt;2. Along those same lines, have you ever taken an entire afternoon for your lunch break because of geocaching?&lt;br/&gt;3. Do you have trouble going anywhere without first checking to see if there is a geocache in that area you have not yet found?&lt;br/&gt;4. Does the sport of geocaching come up in almost all conversations you have?&lt;br/&gt;5. Do you consider the number of geocaches you have found to be guiding your self-confidence?&lt;br/&gt;6. Do you use geocaching to help you relax?&lt;br/&gt;7. Have you left home without something you are supposed to bring (like your spouse) but never without your Geocaching bag?&lt;br/&gt;8. Do you log in to Geocaching.com as soon as you wake up to see if there is a new cache in your area (OK, then how about just before you go to bed)?&lt;br/&gt;9. Do you forget your spouses name, but remember the cache number to your favorite geocache?&lt;br/&gt;10. Have you begged your spouse to take you to the local dollar store to get more &quot;log books&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;11. Do you lie to others about how often you geocache?&lt;br/&gt;12. Has anyone asked you to &quot;Sit down, we need to talk&quot; about your geocaching?&lt;br/&gt;13. We're here to help. This cache is a test to see how addicted to geocaching you really are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to not find this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you resist searching out this cache?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show the world how strong you are. You can stop Geocaching anytime you want. Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really you can...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Fiiiind meeee...&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you hear something off in the distance... ? Never mind. It must have been the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(BTW  I can quit at anytime...

&lt;p&gt;Want to get into
geo-biking?  All you need is some info about riding trails and
one answer is the Rails to Trails
Conservancy.  This
is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages trails
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best
site features for geocachers is the ability to download a GPX file
of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include restrooms,
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail itself
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance you
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the GPX
file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to export to
your GPS. This cache is accessible via the Lebanon Bike
Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join now and start
geobiking!&lt;/p&gt;

This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail.  There’s parking near either end.  Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA.  Near geocache GC235X5 .&lt;br/&gt;The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 .  The trail is about 5 miles long.  The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caches in the series are:&lt;br/&gt;Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM &lt;br/&gt;Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR &lt;br/&gt;Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV&lt;br/&gt;Earth   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKW&lt;br/&gt;Mars      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM1&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM3&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMA&lt;br/&gt;Saturn    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMD&lt;br/&gt;Uranus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMJ&lt;br/&gt;Neptune   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMM&lt;br/&gt;Pluto    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYNB&lt;br/&gt;And bonus caches&lt;br/&gt;Eris http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN7&lt;br/&gt;Comets http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN5&lt;br/&gt;Meteors   http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYN2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable.

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods

are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the

While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods
mountain biking.  There
are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for the main mountain bike trails is
at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N39 35.214 W84 46.098&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods
mountain biking.  There
are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for the main mountain bike trails is
at:&lt;/p&gt;

are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for the main mountain bike trails is
at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N39 35.214 W84 46.098&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods
mountain biking.  There
are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for the main mountain bike trails is
at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N39 35.214 W84 46.098&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The caches in the series are:&lt;br/&gt;Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM &lt;br/&gt;Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR &lt;br/&gt;Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV&lt;br/&gt;Earth   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKW&lt;br/&gt;Mars      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM1&lt;br/&gt;Asteroids    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXM3&lt;br/&gt;Jupiter    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMA&lt;br/&gt;Saturn    http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMD&lt;br/&gt;Uranus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMJ&lt;br/&gt;Neptune   http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXMM&lt;br/&gt;Pluto    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYNB&lt;br/&gt;And bonus caches&lt;br/&gt;Eris http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN7&lt;br/&gt;Comets http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYN5&lt;br/&gt;Meteors   http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GYN2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;American Elm (White Elm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulmus
americana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest and most
widespread elm in the United States. The tallest example in Ohio
today, growing in Hamilton County, stands 97 feet. The tall,
drooping crown growing above divided trunks gives the mature tree a
distinctive, vase-like appearance. The tree grows on rich, moist
bottomlands and in ravines, and sometimes on moist slopes and
woodlands. Although widespread in Ohio, many trees have been
destroyed by the Dutch Elm disease. In the past it extensively was
used as a shade and ornamental tree. The wood has been used in much
the same way as that of the 
Slippery Elm. Both birds and mammals feed on fruit and buds,
and mammals will the the bark and twigs of younger
trees.&lt;/p&gt;

The middle surface has a series of mill grooves. Locate&lt;br /&gt;the most horizontal of the grooves and place your paper towel tube&lt;br /&gt;in the horizontal groove.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look through the tube in the direction of the pond, with your&lt;br /&gt;eye about six inches from the tube. The view you see through the&lt;br /&gt;tube is the approximate location of the final coordinates. You'll&lt;br /&gt;have to look around a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you are in the area identified in Step 2, look for the&lt;br /&gt;final coordinates recorded on a fixed object. The coordinates are&lt;br /&gt;not well hidden but will not be obvious to bystanders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination cache is a small plastic jar covered in camo&lt;br /&gt;tape. There isn't room for much more than the log but feel free to&lt;br /&gt;leave small items such as coins or travel bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cache has no theme but if you do want to leave something,&lt;br /&gt;leave something interesting that YOU would like to find in a cache.&lt;br /&gt;Too many geocaches out there are stuffed to the gills with Happy&lt;br /&gt;Meal toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE BE DISCREET!&lt;/b&gt; Mugglepunks roam the nearby&lt;br /&gt;woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Info about the rock:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stone sculpture at your starting point is the seventh of eight&lt;br /&gt;scultures featured in the &quot;Kettering Rocks!&quot; International Stone&lt;br /&gt;Sculpting Exposition. This sculpture was created by Japanese&lt;br /&gt;artist, Keizo Ushio (hence the cache's name &quot;Ushio's Portal&quot;). His&lt;br /&gt;stone carving is recognized throughout the world for the mastery of&lt;br /&gt;the difficult technique in carving intertwining ribbons of stone&lt;br /&gt;and three-dimensional circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache was maintained by Saxmerz from 2005 until benji55545&lt;br /&gt;adopted it in March 2008.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FNK4D7 - GCK4D7 Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Waypoint added by Keystone, December 2006.&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: S2K4D7 - GCK4D7 Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Waypoint added by Keystone, December 2006.</groundspeak:long_description>

The outside should be spraypainted black, but that may have worn away in the past couple years. I'll check on it when I come home next month, but I'm pretty sure you're finding the right thing, it's just been emptied by some muggles.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, the cache has gone missing twice now, and the tree is in&lt;br /&gt;pieces. So no more climbing. I guess its fitting that Southdale&lt;br /&gt;school nearby changed their mascot from the Purple Panthers to the&lt;br /&gt;district standard Firebirds... Ho hum. I'll leave the old&lt;br /&gt;description here for posterity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American panthers are known by many names. They are&lt;br /&gt;called cougars, mountain lions, catamounts or pumas depending on&lt;br /&gt;who you ask. Not too many panthers call Southwest Ohio home&lt;br /&gt;anymore, but Southdale Elementary has adopted Panthers as their&lt;br /&gt;mascot nonetheless. American panthers are usually about 10 times&lt;br /&gt;the size of the typical housecat. Despite this, they are classified&lt;br /&gt;in the general &quot;small cat&quot; category, since they have the ability to&lt;br /&gt;purr and not roar. They have been known to be able to jump 25 feet&lt;br /&gt;horizontally and 18 feet vertically. And like any other cat, they&lt;br /&gt;have an uncanny ability to climb trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;READ THIS!: Avoid the part without bark, it is crumbling. The&lt;br /&gt;cache is in plain view, so spot it before trying to retrieve&lt;br /&gt;it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some general rules for the cache...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Do not attempt alone! It will be much easier and safer with a&lt;br /&gt;caching partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Do not attempt in wet or foul weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Do not attempt at dawn, dusk, twilight, or any variation of&lt;br /&gt;night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Do not attempt if you are not in good physical condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -And most importantly... if you weigh over 175 lbs or so don't try&lt;br /&gt;to retrieve the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache is a small container with room only for very small trade&lt;br /&gt;items. Do not attempt to sign log and trade items at the cache's&lt;br /&gt;location. Instead, hand it to your partner and retreat from the&lt;br /&gt;cache site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Original contents: Log and pencil, shell lei, Eisenhower&lt;br /&gt;dollar&lt;/i&gt;

This park is a great spot to sit down on one of the&lt;br /&gt;park benches and watch the world drive by. Read the plaque on&lt;br /&gt;Patterson, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest parking on the east end of Thruston Blvd. and walking&lt;br /&gt;across the street.

I saw this one pop up this morning and thought about sending an e-mail to gallaghd or ghs, so they could add another FTF to their long lists, but then I thought &quot;Hey, you can grab this one on your lunch hour.&quot;  So, I popped the coords into my Garmin Dakota and off I went.  I knew within a few feet where it was, seeing that I drive by here at least 5 days each week.

I arrived, glad that there was not a service vehicle already parked there, and started my search.  I got to within 3 feet of the posted coordinates and found the cache.

All was in good shape and I was suprised when Coach said he passed this one over when he was here before working on the multi. But not today, we found it and signed in. Thanks I&amp;S for another well done geocache!</groundspeak:text>

The park is very nice and accessible all year.  You can drive your vehicle up the hill to cut down on the walk or you can hike up from the main parking lot.  Muggles may be in the area from time to time, so stealth may be required.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The container itself is a small lock n lock so it should not be difficult to locate.  Inside you will find the usual log and swag items.  For the First To Find I have included a handmade key fob.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Placed with the permission of the city.   It has been asked that I remind folks of the curfew in affect in all parks</groundspeak:long_description>

There are roots, trash, and other obsticals around the cache location.  The hill itself can be an obstical.  Just watch yourstep and you should be fine.  Free Hint:  Take the easy root when entering the tree line.  No need to go bushwacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed with the permission of the city.  The city did ask that I remind folks about the curfew in place in all of the city parks.</groundspeak:long_description>

placed this cache on 9/17/09 while paddling without
a shuttle along the Mad River.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had to hitch-hike/walk back
to my vehicle, after floating to many great
caches. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Big Thank You to a random
soul named Zach for taking a chance, and giving this crazy looking
tattooed freak a lift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  However,  the title is not
a &quot;Thank You&quot; aimed at Zach, it is a BIG &quot;THANK YOU&quot; to all of the
cachers/hiders in the Dayton area that have placed fabulous terrain
challenges for me to find.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am
pulled West by all of these great
caches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THANK
YOU:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will add to this list as time

caches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The terrain rating for this cache may need adjusted. I
came in by kayak, which may, or may not be the easy way. Please let
me know in your logging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thank
You  &lt;strong&gt;on the Mad River), as a
gesture of appreciation for all of the great terrain challenge
caches in the Dayton area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 This one is in the same spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, it would probably be close to a 4.5 even without the boat
(maybe).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you see the cache,
and say  &quot;No
Thanks&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with
bringing your own pen/writing utensil, I suggest bringing something
to tie yourself off with while making the grab. I used no equipment
when placing the cache, However, it is in a very tricky
spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE
SAFE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to

Welcome to Tecumseh Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want a trail map and other info park at the mid-trail bulliten board at Prairie Ridge: N40*06.290, W084*38.085. Be careful crossing Broadway. Please use the desinated parking and trail, avoid private property.&lt;br/&gt;This is a historically significant place...so an Ohio history/symbols/icons theme for the cache! Initial contents include Ohio history and Ohio symbols momentos. Honor the theme if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy 1/4 mile hike, The first half is fully accessable, then it may get a little muddy. The cache is just off the trail and well hidden, with tree canopy to mess with your GPS.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the second in a series of caches that I will be placing while cycling Northeast Allen County. While not required, I encourage seekers to find this the same way it was placed, via riding a bike. I cycled 17 miles one way to reach the site.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is located along one of my frequent long cycling routes. It also near the Adventure Cycling-&quot;Northern Lakes&quot; Touring Route, which connects Indiana to the U.P. and Wisconsin. If you DO ride, please take a picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you to a long abdoned one room school. I neglected to annotate the name of the school for research but I will update this listing after I return and check the site. Ironically, I road right by this site several times and never noticed the school. I was inquiring about an abandoned school north of this locaton when the farmer adjacent to this site told me about it. Very cool. There are several other caches nearby so it doesn't have to be a single find day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the country, it's definately NOT MUGGLE FREE. Be careful. The neighbors keep a vigilant eye on what happens in their neighborhood. This one has a BUNCH of trees to hide in but the neighbor across the road will most likely notice you are there. If you choose to drive your gas guzzling vehicle (grrrrrr, booooo, hissssss) please DO NOT park in front of their house. There are several sites to park. There is a parking lot a short walk away, at Pond-A-River Golf Club. CITO. There is a bit of litter. Help clean it up by taking at least one item with you. Enough room for a small tradables but not not much. Lil' Labs added an eraser but not much else will fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size is bigger than bison tube, but not much. It is fatter than a typical bison tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do ride your bike to the cache, &lt;b&gt;it would be nice if&lt;/b&gt; you'd take a picture and include it in your log (please don't reveal the exact cache location in your shot)&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first in a series of caches that I will be placing while cycling Northeast Allen County. While not required, I encourage seekers to find this the same way it was placed, via riding a bike. I cycled 14.22 miles one way to reach the site.&lt;br /&gt;
Please put back EXACTLY as you found it.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located along one of my frequent long cycling routes. It also crosses the Adventure Cycling-&quot;Northern Lakes&quot; Touring Route, which connects Indiana to the U.P. and Wisconsin. If you DO ride, be aware that there is a notorious bike chasing dog on the south western side on the Amish farm. He only seems to chase those that ride south of Notestine Road, along 101. He has never chased me when east or west bound on Notestine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While in the country, it's definately NOT MUGGLE FREE. Be careful. This is in very open territory and the Amish neighbors keep a vigilant eye on what happens in their neighborhood. There are no trees or buildings to hide behind. Please remember to CITO. Enough room for a few small tradables and I placed a few items to start it off. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you do ride your bike to the cache, &lt;b&gt;it would be nice if&lt;/b&gt; you'd take a picture and include it in your log (please don't reveal the exact cache location in your shot) 


*** 8/21/12     I stopped by to check the condition while on a 40 mile bike ride. I decided it was too easy to find so I made a few modifications to make it a bit tougher. As such, I have bumped the difficulty rating just a bit. It is a lot harder to find and the hint is really required now.***</groundspeak:long_description>

Made the FTF at 7:45 am.

Was great seeing all the nature: lots of birds, blue jays, cardinals, swans, cranes and more.  This one was the hardest for me to find, was thinking I might get my 1st DNF of the day but then I spotted it.  This was also the last cache I needed on the the trail.  K stands for Keen series.  Found cache about  3:15 PM for my 11482 find.

The Falling Water Trail is a&lt;br/&gt;10.5mile linear trail based on the old Michigan Central railroad&lt;br/&gt;bed. It runs between Weatherwax Drive, in Jackson, and the Village&lt;br/&gt;of Concord, Michigan. The Falling Water Trail is a major east-west&lt;br/&gt;component of the Jackson County Regional Trail plan, connecting&lt;br/&gt;Cascades, Ella Sharp, Lime Lake and Swains Lake parks in Jackson&lt;br/&gt;County. Your are looking for mostly Lock-N-Lock containers. PARKING&lt;br/&gt;for the trail is at both ends and in the middle. These are south of&lt;br/&gt;the trail a ways on Weatherwax in Jackson, at Teft Rd. near Spring&lt;br/&gt;Arbor, and right at the end on River St. in Concord. You are not&lt;br/&gt;allowed to park at the crossing roads. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mi-geocaching.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Falling Water Trail is a&lt;br/&gt;10.5mile linear trail based on the old Michigan Central railroad&lt;br/&gt;bed. It runs between Weatherwax Drive, in Jackson, and the Village&lt;br/&gt;of Concord, Michigan. The Falling Water Trail is a major east-west&lt;br/&gt;component of the Jackson County Regional Trail plan, connecting&lt;br/&gt;Cascades, Ella Sharp, Lime Lake and Swains Lake parks in Jackson&lt;br/&gt;County. Your are looking for mostly Lock-N-Lock containers. PARKING&lt;br/&gt;for the trail is at both ends and in the middle. These are south of&lt;br/&gt;the trail a ways on Weatherwax in Jackson, at Teft Rd. near Spring&lt;br/&gt;Arbor, and right at the end on River St. in Concord. You are not&lt;br/&gt;allowed to park at the crossing roads. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mi-geocaching.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided to come down this way and pick up the caches on the Falling Water Trail.  Was my first bike trip of the year, think I will pay for it tomorrow.  Had a very good day as I did not get any DNFs today either.  Was great seeing all the nature: lots of birds, blue jays, cardinals, swans, cranes and more.  Just as I got to this one my batteries died.  Found out that the other two sets did not work had to use the next two with my IPhone, then was able to get a set of good ones from the truck.  N stands for Number one series.  Found cache about 12:30 PM for my 11471 find.

The Falling Water Trail is a&lt;br/&gt;10.5mile linear trail based on the old Michigan Central railroad&lt;br/&gt;bed.

Your are looking for mostly Lock-N-Lock containers. PARKING&lt;br/&gt;for the trail is at both ends and in the middle. These are south of&lt;br/&gt;the trail a ways on Weatherwax in Jackson, at Teft Rd. near Spring&lt;br/&gt;Arbor, and right at the end on River St. in Concord.

The Falling Water Trail is a&lt;br/&gt;10.5mile linear trail based on the old Michigan Central railroad&lt;br/&gt;bed.

They should&lt;br/&gt;however help motivate you to get out and unlock your own way to&lt;br/&gt;adventure. It may just be me but it seems that any wooded area that&lt;br/&gt;I go too in Michigan has a cache or two placed by TreePlanter. Some&lt;br/&gt;are easy hides while others will have you scratching your head, or&lt;br/&gt;maybe pulling out your hair! This cache is not in a woods but I did&lt;br/&gt;place it in a tree. If you find yourself in a graveyard you are in&lt;br/&gt;the right place. Take time to look around especially at the stones&lt;br/&gt;marked with a flag. Many who fought in the Civil War, WW I, and WW&lt;br/&gt;II rest here. The flag nearest to the cache stands by a stone&lt;br/&gt;marking the grave of “A Soldier of the Revolution”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mi-geocaching.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Easy to get to and find. 8am&lt;br/&gt;to dusk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a nice shady spot right in the center of the village. Know&lt;br/&gt;wonder I have so many cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, great&lt;br/&gt;grandparents and others buried here. Even though it is an old&lt;br/&gt;cemetery I knew over half the people resting here. Some were very&lt;br/&gt;old when I was very young. The cache is a small yellow tube, and is&lt;br/&gt;hidden in an easy to spot and get to location which is not near any&lt;br/&gt;grave. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mi-geocaching.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

If you are poking around in Mrs. Geoaddict's flowers, you need to let your GPSr settle down first. Parking is available on Grant and Pierce streets. During non-school hours you may also park in the school parking lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people have mentioned that they feel uncomfortable hunting on private property. My family and I are okay with geocachers hunting on our property. By the way, the cache is not very far off the sidewalk and near our driveway. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Daughter Geoness and I met owner out on his front long and had a really nice chat. The cache is an extremely nice find where we traded swag for some trinkets tha Geoness likes with some of my signature first aid kits. Also traded travel bugs that I had retrieves from Raleigh, NC and will bring these back down with me.

Great Cache!

One of the first
caches in Michigan which uses Chirp technology to locate the
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache requires special equipment. In order to find
this cache you must have a Garmin Oregon, Dakota, GPSMAP 62, GPSMAP
78 or a Colorado running the latest software which supports Garmin
chirp. Note: You may need to download a software update to enable
Chirp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The posted coordinates is the entrance to the park. Make sure you
have the chirp enabled when you enter the park. I was hoping that
while driving to the parking lot you would get the CHIRP info you
need. This seemed to only work about 50% of the time. So I suggest
you walk the road from the Y in the road to the parking lot to find
it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final coordinates are given via a Chirp. There is no other way
to get the 2nd stage coordinates. If you don't have the right
equipment, I'm sure you have a friend who does.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final should be easy to find so no hint is given. Have
fun!&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: CH2H96M - CHIRP Location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FL2H96M - Cache final Location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

He was so kind to fix it all up for me and get the chrip a new home. I still am having a problem as it (chirp) would not trigger until I was within 3 feet of it. I am going to try a different chirp and see if it works any better. But until then good luck finding it. It is close to N 42 36.000 W084 35.515.</groundspeak:text>

I wasn't sure what to expect and found this to be quite fun to do. I had a non Garmin guy along with me, maybe one day he will convert.....[:D]

Please take a moment to appreciate this area.

I almost could have walked to this cache from the Pokemon Tournament today.  Drove in heavy traffic, parked, and found the cache relatively easily.  Noticed a muggle in a car afterwards.  Hope he didn't see me!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes, it's true... the family of Zombies you used to know as &lt;b&gt;thevidas&lt;/b&gt; have come back from beyond...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
... from beyond the borders of Michigan, to help place this cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MWAAHAAHAAAAA ! ! !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is only one in a series of mysterious ZOMBIE caches&lt;br /&gt;
placed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=03f97758-6a0a-4e3a-bae1-4194dca469fb&amp;amp;wid=bcf3cfd7-772c-462c-808b-30c3ea45a249&amp;amp;ds=2&quot;&gt;chevyjim&lt;/a&gt; and others around the Lansing area.&lt;br /&gt;
* The posted coordinates are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; the location of this cache *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your best bet in finding the cure, and putting an end to the Zombie plague&lt;br /&gt;
once and for all, is finding clues hidden in the zombie caches like this one.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To4solve the puzzle and locate the hidden1clue you need to know a little something&lt;br /&gt;
about zombies. Try to find out about things like, what do zombies wear on the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;weekends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;
what to zombies eat during &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;... and what is the minimum legal age for&lt;br /&gt;
zombies to get married in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;western&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; half of the state of Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you3have gathered all the possible information you can find about3the lifestyle and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;habits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of zombies, you will need to quickly make an &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;alphabetical&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; list of all4the information gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
Now take that list and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;number&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; them from bottom to top,&lt;br /&gt;
in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;reverse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; alphabetical order (for example, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Z=1, A=26&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now3comes the hard part... still trying to be as quick as you can, as you never know when one&lt;br /&gt;
of the zombies is lurking just around the corner...3you may have to figure out some math...&lt;br /&gt;
Starting at the middle of your list, take every &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;third&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; item, in both directions, and put them on a new list.&lt;br /&gt;
Now6take the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; letter of each line of the new list, and1write them to form a &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;single&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; word.&lt;br /&gt;
This word should give you the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;last&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; clue8you need to solve this puzzle.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may have gotten different zombie stats from the start, which can throw off your list a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
If your final clue word makes absolutely no sense, go back and make sure you have gathered all&lt;br /&gt;
the included information, and use the necessary clues on the cache page.&lt;/p&gt;

After Homebru twisted my arm and threatened me I decided to go out and do a couple of caches today.  Ya right.  All it took was a hint that he was thinking about it and I was on my way to pick him up.  We decided to head to this one first, just in case no one else had done it yet.  Got there and found a brand new log.  Can not figure out where everyone else is, could it be that some have to work.  To bad.  We logged the FTF at 12:20pm.

the name Patriarche Park (formerly Alton Park).
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache was placed with relaxation in mind. Take some time while
caching to enjoy this park's many amenities such as tennis courts,
softball fields, basketball, beach volleyball, a huge playscape,
and great picnic places. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located only a few feet off the trail that cuts
through the park and about 350 feet from the closest parking. Cache
is a small tupperware camouflaged container. Contents include a
Blockbuster of a first time finder's gift, small trading items, and
log book. There is poison ivy in the area, so please be careful.
Cache has only ankle high poison ivy in its general vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Depending on where you park to find this cache, the terrain is fairly easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small container that containes small trading items, the log book, and a first time finder's prize. The park is located next to a beautiful golf course and named after a former director of the Lansing Parks and Recreation Department. The park has a short paved loop that is nice for walking or jogging. Picnic tables and playground equipment are located within the park as well as a large open baseball fields with backstops. The park closes at dusk and dogs are welcome at this park, but must be on a leash. Winter accessible. Short distance from US-127.</groundspeak:long_description>

And the way gas prices are now, its starting to cost move to drive around looking for a parking spot.  Anyway Great cache.  I did not end up parking in the park after all.  Found it after I was done.  TN. Left SI.

This is a great park with volleyball courts, basketball, horseshoe pits, playgrounds, and picnic areas. As is the case many times, the most direct path is not the best so be adventurous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to claim this cache as found, you must physically find the cache and sign the log sheet. it is a micro so it only has a log in it. bring your own pen or pencil. Congrats to The Allen Cachers on first to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could easily spend an afternoon here. There are several caches along the trails and the total hiking loop can be a scenic 2.5 miles long. It's a great hike on a well groomed trail. Park Hours are Dawn to Dusk&lt;br/&gt;Bring your gear and cover up your skin. Ya never know what kind of terrain you will come across or what you will need to get to your destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have started charging admission fee for this park. they started charging in may of 2012.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in a park &amp; ride off of I-69.  It is a camo'd lock n lock container.  To get the cache out of it's hiding spot you might have to either be very small or crawl on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We chose this cache location because there are not any other caches nearby and because we have family that lives nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be stealthy as this seems to be a busy location.  Perhaps there is even a person living in their car at this location.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original contents are all themed around playing games (Monopoly, cards, dice games etc.) If you do not have any game related trading items feel free to trade whatever you wish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to find prize is a &quot;first to find&quot; Signal tin of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Cache had apparently been muggled, or at least had come up missing.  We have made it a smaller container, with room for only small trade items. We did still try to keep the theme.&lt;br/&gt;Sorry, no FTF on this one, as it's just a replacement at the original coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Who would have ever thought... the original container was never lost.  It apparently was hidden better than we had placed it, and a few people, including us, could not find it.  Then suddenly after there was a new container for a few months, we get reports of 2 containers.  Sure enough, the original container is there!&lt;br/&gt;We have since removed the second, smaller container.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to all those that let us know there were 2. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The cache is a black ammo can hidden a little bit off the ground. It should be easy to spot once you get near the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the specific hide location so that fellow cachers can go through the contents and sign the log without being in view of the parking lot, even in the winter. The cache should be safer that way, but as a result, there could be a little bushwhacking and/or you could encounter a few thorns on the way to the cache depending on where you enter the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that you enjoy your rest stop.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tribbles (Polygeminus grex) are fictional animals of the Star Trek universe. They are small, soft and gentle and produce a soothing purring sound. These traits are said to endear them to most sentient beings which encounter them, including GEOCACHERS. They also reproduce at an amazing rate, leading to the expression &quot;multiplying like tribbles&quot; and thus to the theme of this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Cache:This cache is only one of the baby tribbles spawned by &quot;Tribble Your Pleasure; Tribble Your Fun&quot; (GC2BY2G). This &quot;tribble&quot; has found a home of its own just like so many tribbles that have gone before. this cache is hiding near the restaurant. The more they eat the faster they reproduce at an amazing rate, leading to the expression &quot;multiplying like tribbles&quot; and thus to the theme of this cache. They will eat all kinds of food. If we are not careful we will have a lot of little tribbles around. This is the 15 in a series to improve the caching in the vernon and near by areas. as always watch out for muggles while searching for this cache as it is in a high traffic area. stealth is required to find this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;List of Tribble Trove offspring on www.geocaching.com&lt;br/&gt;GC20VYY - Spock's Tribble Trouble, born 14-Nov-2009 thanks to HoofNHand&lt;br/&gt;GC213CG - Tribble Liberation, born 17-Nov-2009 thanks to sir-cachealot&lt;br/&gt;GC22C1B - A Tribble in the Woods, born 30-Dec-2009 thanks to tessandfriends&lt;br/&gt;GC22EY5 - Don't Forget the Milk, Eggs, and Tribble!, born 01-Jan-2010 thanks to greenearth124&lt;br/&gt;GC24Y02 - Tribble 7.0 - Lakeland Trail, born 11-Mar-2010 thanks to D.A.D.D.&lt;br/&gt;GC23YY2 - What a Tribble Reads, born 15-Mar-2010 thanks to sir-cachealot&lt;br/&gt;GC26ANA - A Tribble at Play, born 07-Apr-2010 thanks to Covert_Ops&lt;br/&gt;GC25B16 - Music to a Tribble's ears, born 12-Apr-2010 thanks to geo_string&lt;br/&gt;GC27KGX - A Tribble in Dibbleville, born 28-Apr-2010 thanks to mmc881&lt;br/&gt;GC28NRB - Tribbled Waters, born 26-May-2010 thanks to jefrank&lt;br/&gt;GC27NC8 - What a Tribble Collects, born 04-Jun-2010 thanks to Paddling Pirates&lt;br/&gt;GC2A8X3 - Where No Tribble Has Gone Before, born 18-Jun-2010 thanks to Team_FMA&lt;br/&gt;GC2AX6T - I Love Tribbles; Some Think They Taste Great!, born 28-Jun-2010 thanks to Skrip&lt;br/&gt;GC2BY2G -Tribble Your Pleasure; Tribble Your Fun, born 18-Jul-2010 thanks to Sludge_Shoveler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to claim this cache as found, you must physically find the cache and sign the log sheet. it is a micro so it only has a log in it. bring your own pen or pencil.

Got some great new ideas for this one form a couple of other caches i seen and done here. So keep your eyes on this one. During the summer of 2012 look for a more challenging and interesting cache here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Terrain is a 1.5 only because of&lt;br /&gt;stairs and gravel grade which would make it not easily accessable&lt;br /&gt;for those with chairs/walkers. The grade is not steep, and other&lt;br /&gt;than wandering through some weeds, it should be easy walking. No&lt;br /&gt;swamping, or serious bushwhacking needed, but who knows what'll&lt;br /&gt;happen once things green up :) Good luck and enjoy. Cache is a&lt;br /&gt;small (Micro) container, with log book and pencil however no room&lt;br /&gt;for trade items. It is NOT similar to it's surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

It seems that wanted to make this area a little easier to see, so they've installed steps, a viewing platform, a few benches, and restroom facilities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a simple one, but will involve many stairs, hence the 1.5 rating. No off trail travel will be needed. Please respect the area, it gets more beautiful each time I stop by.

&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a black, 16 ounce, ointment jar concealed with natural
materials. &lt;b&gt;This cache will be difficult to locate in the winter
snow--Park is gated late fall-spring. Tree cover affects GPSr
accuracy....thus the 1.5 difficulty rating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Located in one of the most beautiful, non-freeway, roadside parks
in mid-Michigan. It's a very peaceful and scenic place. You'll have
to watch out for muggles, but not as many as you might
expect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kiddie friendly, but keep an eye on your children as there is a
small lake nearby that may arouse their curiousity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please sign the log book, and if you take something, please leave
something of &lt;b&gt;equal&lt;/b&gt; value. Please
reconceal this cache well, but don't make the hiding spot
obvious............this &quot;natural&quot; hide is part of the majic of this
adventure&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please rehide this cache well.&lt;/b&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Homebru and i decided to get away and find a few caches today.  We were glad the weatherman was wrong again and we did not get rained out.  But on the other hand we did get some warm temps and at least it was not HOT again.  Homebru made the find while I was off looking in all the wrong places.  Cache is in good shape.  Found cache about  6:00 PM for my 9848 find.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In order to claim this cache as found, you must physically find the cache and sign the log sheet. it is a micro so it only has a log in it. bring your own pen or pencil. Congrats to ... on first to find.&lt;br /&gt;

P.S. If u have better Coordinates please post them or email them to me. thanks.</groundspeak:long_description>

Before 1900, no one in their right mind would have wanted to
live in this God-forsaken lumber town on the border of Clare and
Gladwin Counties. Most Michigan ghost towns started with a sawmill,
railroad or a mine. Meredith was different- it started with a
saloon. Maybe that's why people said it was doomed from the start.
Yet as many as 2,000 people lived there briefly because it was
where the work was, felling and hauling the timber from the immense
forests that spread into parts of three counties. Per capita, it
was probably the roughest, toughest town in all of lower Michigan
in those days.  With scores of barroom fistfights, a daily
occurrence, along with numerous gunfights and murders. Meredith had
it's lumber boom hayday in the 1880s and early 1890s, then the town
up and died. Now it quietly sits along  M-18 minding it's own
business, a ghost town that has come back a little over the last
fifty years.
&lt;p&gt;Among the many uncertainties about Meredith is how it got it's
name. Local legend has it that early lumbermen called it that in
honor of the area's first saloon which was near Frank Meredith's
lumber camp. The saloon was started by one Tom McClennon who
followed the railroad in from Harrison and in 1881 also built a
hotel called Corrigan House, named after the railroad conductor.
Pine timbering in Clare County reached a peak in the late 1870s and
1880s. There were fifty lumber camps in the northern townships and
the woods were crawling with lumberjacks. Most of the big
operators- Wells, Stone and Company, Hoyt, Murphy Dorr and
Roscommon among them- hauled logs south to Meredith and the new PM
railroad. Grand Haven Lumber Company brought in it's own logging
railroad and used it to get the timber from the woods to the
connecting railroads. Some years, more than 3,000 men worked in the
cold and clammy camps for weeks on end. Meredith became the
commercial center for the main things most men wanted- a hot meal,
a warm place to sleep, booze and women. With this main menu, the
town had a reputation as Sin City, USA. For those who controlled
their liquor and tempers, fistfights and gunfights were free and
regular entertainment. There were no lawmen to speak of. It was
said this came about as a result of disputes over the location of
the county seat and the subsequent refusal of the majority of the
voters to pay for most county expenses, including the jail. The
sheriff stopped making arrests when the county supervisors wouldn't
reimburse him for taking prisoners to jails in adjacent counties.
There were no prosecutions for thievery, murder and other crimes.
To complicate matters, Meredith was on the border of townships in
two counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 1881, Meredith grew up fast around the depot and hotel.
Within a year, the village had forty businesses including a score
of hotels, saloons and boarding houses (many of ill repute).
Prostitution, gambling and fighting got so bad that Corrigan and
others put out a call for a missionary to come and help clean
things up. That lasted a few months until the church was burned
down. Other types of commerce prevailed for a while.  The
village in 1887 had a railroad roundhouse for engine repair, two
general stores, two jewelry stores, a meat market, livery stable,
sawmill, three restaurants and eventually twelve saloons, a city
hall and opera house that seated 700 people. At least 500 people,
including many respectable folks who ran legitimate stores, shops
and other businesses, lived in town year-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McClennon had the monopoly on booze. Not only did he supply the
other saloons, but each lot in Meredith had the restriction that
nobody except McClennon could sell whiskey or beer in Meredith
without paying him a $400 annual fee in addition to the regular
$300 license. McClennon was a big man, intimidatingly strong, and
only one man ever challenged him on this. Dewey Allen leased a lot,
erased the restriction and sub-leased it to a Mount Pleasant saloon
keeper by the name of O'Brien, who opened a tavern on it. As soon
as he heard, McClennon boarded the next train for Meredith from his
Saginaw home and gave O'Brien exactly one hour to get out of town.
O'Brien emptied his shelves, packed his goods in a hired livery rig
and cleared the city limits with twelve minutes to spare. Nobody
argued with Tom McClennon. McClennon never was prosecuted and soon
was long gone, taking his bag of badness to Seney an spreading his
lawless ideas into the upper peninsula. McClennon was it's founder,
but the story of Meredith is basically the story of Jim Carr. Carr
was one of Michigan history's worst scoundrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in New York state in 1855, Carr came to Clare County's
north woods in 1878. After working three years in a lumber camp he
turned up in Harrison seeking easier ways to make money then
cutting down trees. In 1881, he formed an unholy alliance with a
prostitute named Maggie Duncan which, while they disdained
matrimony, nevertheless lasted until they died together a decade
later. That same year Carr built a combined saloon, dance hall and
brothel- with Maggie as madam- on a hill just outside of Harrison.
In two years he made so much money selling whiskey and women,
rolling drunks and cashing lumberjacks' time cards at a 25%
discount that in 1884 he opened a branch saloon and &quot;stockade&quot; in
Meredith, installing one of the Harrison girls as den mother. By
this time Carr had acquired a considerable reputation for murder,
arson and various other felonies. He was said to have been involved
in the murder of at least three men, and that with two accomplices
he had burned down a rival &quot;stockade&quot; near Harrison. One of his
victims was a man who operated a bordello in Meredith before Carr
got there and whom Carr couldn't persuade to leave town. Another
was buried on the Meredith &quot;stockade&quot; premises under a dead horse.
Investigators later dug up the horse but couldn't find the man.
Carr was a mild, soft-spoken, medium-size man, quieter than a
rattlesnake but just as deadly. Jim Carr's big troubles began when
he caused the death of Frankie Osborne, one of the girls at the
Meredith &quot;stockade&quot;. In retaliation for a flippant remark, Carr
knocked the girl down using brass knuckles, kicked her and then
turning to his bouncers said &quot;Finish her off&quot;. The bouncer kicked
her into insensibility. She later died that night in her bedroom
upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brutal act was to be Carr's undoing. Up until that time,
the law in Clare County had been practically invisible. But in
1884, a reform candidate, W.A. Burritt, was elected prosecuting
attorney and he vowed to get on Carr's case and put him behind
bars. It took him tow years to do it, hurdling such obstacles as
hung juries, stuborn witnesses and venal judges, but on January 21,
1886, Carr was sentenced to fifteen years in Jackson prison for
murder. Maggie was also convicted of running a bawdy house and
sentenced to a year in the Detroit House of Corrections. Penniless,
broke and looking for trouble, they both returned to Meredith in
1887 after Carr's conviction was overturned by the State Supreme
court on the grounds that it was based on inconclusive evidence.
But Burritt continued to hound Carr with arrests and trails for
arson, murder and other crimes. By 1890, Carr was virtually
penniless after paying the fees of expensive Flint and Saginaw
attorneys. His health was also broken by alcoholism and venereal
disease. On March 15, 1892, in a wretched little lumber shanty on
an abandoned logging railroad south of Meredith, Jim and Maggie
died within hours of each other, under mysterious circumstances.
Carr was only thirty-seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom fell out of Meredith by 1893 when all the good timber
was exhausted and the big cutters and haulers moved their equipment
to other towns. The railroad tracks and depot were taken out and
most of the businesses, and saloons too closed. The post office
closed in 1895. A forest fire swept through the village in 1896,
but there was no one left to put it out. Among a few buildings that
weren't burned was the opera house which later was moved south to
Arthur Township and rebuilt as a church. Meredith became a ghost
town before 1900 and remained that way for the next fifty years.
After World War II, speculator Herbert McIntish purchased the town
for a song and sold long-abandoned properties off to forty poor
families who were looking  for cheap housing in the area.
Weathered street signs put up before 1900 mark the way to rutted
muddy roads into the woods. Today, most of the residents are
retirees, according to Judith Hopkins, Franklin Township Clerk.
Depending on which side of the county border road of M-18 they live
on, the children go to either Gladwin or Harrison schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, a number of younger families have moved to
Meredith, including several local business owners. The Meredith
General Store was rebuilt forty years ago over the original town
store that was next to the railroad station before 1900. The town
also has another, larger store and a restaurant, but still has no
church. A church was built nearby in the 1930's, but it was
mysteriously burned down around 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meredith has three cemeteries and some barely visible burial
plots in the woods. Jim and Maggie's graves are somewhere out there
in a private cemetery once owned by &quot;Good Old Tom Garrity&quot;. Garrity
obliged as he did for all &quot;no goods&quot; and for $200 provided a
private burial plot. As the barroom friends of the dead would
escort the bodies in a wagon to the burial site they would sing,
&quot;Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, If Meredith won't have them,
Garrity must&quot; All cemeteries are fenced off with &quot;Keep Out&quot; and &quot;No
Trespassing&quot; signs. This seems a bit strange since just about all
the descendants who might have wanted to visit have moved away
decades ago. Perhaps because many of the interred are there because
they didn't mind their business, the signs are a warning to
others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Town
Name:&lt;/strong&gt; Leota&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population:&lt;/strong&gt;
175&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reason For Becoming a Lost
Town:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The lumber mill closed for good in 1922 and
the remains of the Hackley &amp; Hume railroad and a later spur of
the PM were totally removed&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Town History:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The
lumber boom made short work of places like Leota.... A dam built on
the Upper Muskegon River in 1875 by B.G. Robbins led to Leota's
development after 1896. Robbins and S.C. Hall had sawmills there
for a few years, operating from camps and wanigans (small river
barges with shacks) and then out of an obscure little place in the
woods called Jonesville, long gone before 1900. Getting the logs
down to their mills was back-breaking and expensive and they gave
up. In the 1880s, Hackley and Hume built a large rollway above the
river for storing the logs, next to their logging railroad and the
began to attract others. Soon after the lumber bon collapsed for
nearby Meredith in 1896, Arthur E. Rhodes moved his mill and
equipment from Clare and started logging and sawing at the sturdy
eight-foot dam. He had 200 men working in his lumber camps... By
1899, a village had developed around the mill. Rhodes opened a
store and post office and named the place Leota after his daughter,
Leota Rhodes Green. All too soon several saloons were opened, along
with a boarding house and another store. The town was buzzing with
big saws day and night, many folks working twelve-hour shifts....
The Leota lumbermen were a rowdy bunch, some of them left over from
the mayhem at Meredith. For nearly ten years they controlled the
town. There were scores of fights and several killings and
mysterious drownings at the dame. Temperance and religion were not
welcome there. In 1908, a preacher named D.C. Jones came to lead an
anti-saloon league, talking up things like morality and education.
He was shouted down and violently run out of town every time he
came, once in a hail of rocks and bullets. After several attempts
and a fire in the village in 1909, Jones succeeded and eventually
built the first church, a United Methodist, which also served as
the first school. That year, John Cleveland built a barrel stave
mill which brought in a score of new, law-abiding workers and their
families who immediately were looking for a place to worship and a
school for their children. Nearly 300 people lived in Leota before
World War I. By 1916, Leota got it's first standard public school.
By then,however, most of the good timber had been cut out of the
woods and Leota started to die. After a few final salvos, the mill
closed for good in 1922 and the remains of the Hackley &amp; Hume
railroad and a later spur of the PM were totally removed. By 1930,
this mere shadow of the former town was nearly deserted... Better
roads in the 1950s helped bring Leota back (this is about the time
my grandfathers started coming from Alma to deer hunt near the old
site of Jonesville). Fishing and hunting and, after 1960, off-road
vehicles and snowmobiling, became the new attractions... In the
village today, there are six businesses, including a tavern,
restaurant and a canoe livery. The town got a small
non-denominational, mission church in 1932 and still has services
once a week. Up the road, the last schoolhouse, vacant for many
years after 1930, has been built over into a large private
residence. The post office was closed after twenty years way back
in 1919&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lumbering town of
Jonesville was located upstream from this bridge? Could the nearby
Lumber mill remains along a feeder creek to he Muskegon River be
part of the absent Jonesville? I am betting so. In modern times,
once the bridge grew to old for car traffic, this area was
redeveloped into an ORV trailhead and open riding area Watch for
all forms of ORV's in the area and everything but trucks on the
bridge, yet this is a great area to enjoy the river or pitch a tent
while canoeing down the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the
remains of this lumber mill. The lumber town of Jonesville was
located upstream from the emerging town of Leota. The dam in Leota
had the water levels roughly 8 feet higher then current level,
which would have made the nearby stream a power source for this
mill. By 1900, nothing was left of Jonesville and this lumber
mill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family has been hunting
here for many decades, but information about the mill name, size
and history has been nearly impossible to find. You will park at
the top of the ridge and have an easy walk down our trail to the
cache location along a small clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will be made
unavailable for the month of November&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dolph is a small, mostly
historical locale in the northeast of the township along the
Muskegon River. Dolph service men from lumber camping in the area.
Once the lumber stopped flowing down the Muskegon river, the town
slowly faded away. It was named for storekeeper Charles L. Dolph,
who became the first postmaster on April 13, 1898. The post office
was discontinued on June 15, 1926. While on private property, the
post office was located a few hundred yards west of this cache. All
that is left is a few private resident and hunting camps&lt;/p&gt;

ORIGINAL CONTENTS of final stage: Logbook, 2 Pens, 2 Pencils,
Pencil Sharpener, FTF Prize, 2 Ziploc Bags
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So i had been thinking about placing an unknown cache for awhile.
So here it is, idea of this comes from a class warm-up form a
teacher named Steve Westjohn!!! I remember doing these everyday
senior year, they were great!!!! So I've created a slightly altered
one for everyone to solve. I have included an answer checker above
if anyone really wants to use it!!! Step 1: Go to the posted
coordinates and you will be looking for a MICRO SIZED camo
container. Inside you will find sheets of paper with the same
puzzle on them, TAKE ONE AND LEAVE THE REST(please notify me if
puzzle papers are low{2 or less}but I will try to keep enough out
there)!!! Step 2: Solve the JUMBLED puzzle to find the coordinates
to the FINAL CONTAINER !!!! Step 3: Find the FINAL CONTAINER which
is a camo REGULAR SIZED and sign the logbook and log your visit
online!!!! Notes: •Cache size is unknown because start is
micro and finish is regular •FTF gets first dibs on a 40x
Illuminated Jewelers Loupe •I suggest reading the hint
•Both hides are on State Forest Land ***Thank You for viewing
or trying this cache and ANY FEEDBACK IS ALWAYS WELCOME!!!***&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2ZQBJ - GC2ZQBJ Final&lt;br /&gt;N  __ ° __ . ___ W ___ ° __ . ___ </groundspeak:long_description>

So I did a little research and found this to be State Forest Land just behind our local High School &amp; a few area businesses.  So we decided to place a cache.  Very peaceful little ride, will probably be taking the JEEP on this one every now and then. HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYS!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> Located near the Marl Lake hiking trails within the South Higgins Lake State Park. The best intended route is the hiking trails of Marl Lake, while geocaching other locations in the area, to trail checkpoint #7 continuing west on the 2-track access road, but this cache can also be easily reached from Markey Road &amp; hiking a short ways in. It's not too difficult, but be aware of the old foundation ruins near the cache that are the remains of the farm. Please do not disturb or play in the ruins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the location of the former Burleson family farm &amp; orchard dating to prior to the 1890's. The Burleson farm was well established prior to the Sharp families arrival to the Higgins Lake area in 1898. The original property was mainly an orchard extending from near the cache location where the barns, farmhouse &amp; various outbuilding formerly stood- to the corner of Markey Rd. and School Rd. where the ball field is today. There are still many apple trees standing from the orchard in the area &amp; along Markey Rd. as well.&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, the property north and east of Burleson's farm at Marl Lake, now also part of the park, was formerly owned by the Statler family... known famously in Country Music as the Statler Bros. The Marl Lake access today is where the Statler family cottage &amp; buildings once stood.&lt;br/&gt;Emil Burleson was the last of his families line to operate the farm until the late 1940's, then the Myer family occupied the farm until ~1952 when the land was granted back to the State of Michigan and attached to the parkland of the South Higgins Lake State Park.&lt;br/&gt;There are several foundations of the remains of the Burlseon farm in this area near the cache, so please be very careful of where you walk. Also, please do not disturb the foundation remains as they are very fragile- an easy way to get yourself hurt as well.&lt;br/&gt;If you park at the Marl Lake access and hike the trail loops to the location, you will need a valid State Park pass on your vehicle. You can also park on Markey Rd. near the cache location, and it is a very short hike in. The cache is in a flat medium Sterite latching waterproof container &amp; painted camouflage. Enclosed is a zip-locked bagged log book &amp; pencil... and a travel bug as a prize for the first finder. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Nothing like camping at the South Higgins Lake State Park! This geocache is located in a small hiking trail area between the east &amp; west campgrounds. If you are not a registered camper &amp; just visiting this area of the park, please use discression and stay away from the campsite lots and do not disturb the campers. This should be a fairly easy find, the cache is a medium sized rubbermaid container painted camouflage to blend into the surounding ground cover.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The South Higgins Lake State Park is one of the largest parks in Michigan, and is a very popular destination for thousands of summertime vacationers.&lt;br /&gt;
Historically speaking, the campground area of this park was once a part of the original homestead property of the Sharp family dating back to 1898. This section of land was 'given' back to the State of Michigan during the 1920's in exchange for land taxes owed- which in turn became the seed property that became the park. Adjacent properties were then purchased by the state to expand the parkland through several stages to what we know it today.&lt;br /&gt;
The area of the cache location, there are several remaining white pine stumps that were cut over 100 years ago during the lumbering era.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Camping in the park in the 1920's just after the park opened to the public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The park campground in 1928.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Camping at 'South State' in 1966!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first finder will find a nice traveling surprise inside!</groundspeak:long_description>

commission.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1903 the first state forest was set up by the
legislature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;on cut-over, burned-over lands in Roscommon
and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crawford counties. The same year also saw the
start&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;of organized forest fire protection and the
establishment of&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Higgins Lake Nursery at its present
site.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;thus began the program of reforestation in
Michigan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Under the leadership of president Franklin Delano
Roosevelt,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Civilian Conservation
Corps camps were established during&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;the early thirties.
F.D.R. recruited thousands of unemployed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;youth and sent them in
battle against the destruction and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;erosion our of natural

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From 1933 until
1942,young men from Camp Higgins Lake did&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;most of the work at the
nursery. They collected pine cones, then&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;their seeds and raised
them to saplings on this site.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workers at other camps
planted seedlings from the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This was the starting point of the Are You Geocacher Enough? Road Rally Event. Guess we were a little slow getting all the new caches loaded as we were the only one a this cache.  Made the find and it was off on a great adventure.  TNLN.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    You will need to write down
the LETTER found on the inside lid of the ammo can at each cache in
the CSI series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;    Upon finishing all 11 caches,
figure out the final cache, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2edc628d-40c9-4be3-8891-54924c5a72a6&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you
on a 3 stage cache hunt that will have you hiking about .4 mi total
round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over half of your
adventure is a nice, wide, grassy snowmobile trail. You should pull
into the old rest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;area through the grass
off  Fletcher Rd., following the old driveway. There is plenty
of room to park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and turn around, just
watch out for the old wooden posts. Dress appropriately; long pants
are best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and watch for the Poison
Ivy. I managed to stay away from it. The 1st stage is a camo lid,
lock-n-lock,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Evidence
Collection” container with cords’ written on the lid to the 2nd
stage there you will find the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coords to the resting
place of the Final cache, which is near what appears is a fresh
shallow grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not remove any
evidence you may find in the area. The authorities know about
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree cover was again an
issue but I was able to collect over 100 points with under 20'
accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roscommon that burnt to

painters had taken a into&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

finish the grape vines inside&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Durant's Castle&quot;, their
turpentine rags caught fire and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;the Castle was a
complete loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The land they owned,
aprox. 2,600 acres, is now a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;state nature preserve,
The Mason Tract. If you’re a fly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;fisherman, this is the
Holy Grail of Trout Fishing. .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The foundation remained
open until the late 80's or early 90's.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We used to be able to
explore the open foundations and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;rooms of the basement.
Yet today, you will find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

described as&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;part of the servant's
quarters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also, Cliff was an
American racecar driver and the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;son of William C.
Durant, the founder of General Motors.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cliff should also be
noted for his contribution to the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;of auto racing. Because
of his insight and financial backing the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Miller Straight Eight
Front Wheel Drive Racing Engine was&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;developed by Harry
Miller and Tommy Milton.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That engine was
revolutionary and dominated the international&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;racing scene for
approximately the next 50-75 years.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Cliff's car, the
Junior Eight, is in the Indy 500 museum.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another one of his cars
(pleasure) is in the&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auburn Cord Museum.
Miller was an automotive design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;genius and also
developed motors for airplanes and boats.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In addition to his
aviation, racing and golf he was also a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;yachtsman who sailed
around the world on his yacht,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;the Aurora. He was also
an excellent musician,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;violin, among other
instruments. Cliff was also the Vice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;President for Sales and
Marketing for Chevrolet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;of California and later
West Coast Distributor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;and General Manager of

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You will need to write down the LETTER found
on the inside lid of the ammo can at each cache in the CSI
series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upon finishing all 11 caches, figure out the
final cache, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2edc628d-40c9-4be3-8891-54924c5a72a6&quot;&gt;

provided.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well if you haven't scaled Mt Fredric, here is your chance. I
suggest a good strong heart for this one. You will definitely get
your cardiovascular workout here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foot trails up the hill, then up to the last hundred feet
are hard packed and good walking expect for the nasty incline ;)
The area has many hiding places, I think tree&lt;br /&gt;
cover will give some folks fits so I averaged the location over 300
points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This looks like it is going to be really fun and adventurous. WOW!! I really didn't want to climb that hill in the dark so I drove around figuring there has to be another way to get there.  Found some roads if you call them that! Sure wish we had 4 wheel drive.  I chose to walk up the road rather than the hill itself, and it was pretty easy going!! I can't imagine doing this one in high humidity, heat and bugs, it was nice doing it in the cool of the night with minimal bugs!! [:)] TFTC</groundspeak:text>

   they could load horse drawn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sleds with logs
like these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache points
out the answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas like this
were dug until the light gauge railroad was run a few
hundred&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yards just south
of this cache. The river was to small to float logs,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so horses and
later rail roads were used to transport the logs to the
German&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;build mill in
Deward. This is also were we hold Trout Camp on weekend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of the last
Saturday in April- yeah!!! Before the Natural River's
Act,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we used to camp
right down by the river. Yet by the acts' rules and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the recently
enforced rules of the Deward Tract we had to move our
camp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back near this
cache. No tents or camping with 75' of the river or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vehicles within
200+' of the river- thus keeping the area natural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the view of
the river. Only a few private house break up Deward,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this area is
home to thousands of protected stumps that were 1 of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last 2 virgin pine
stands to be cut in lower Michigan- Deward and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stratford. Both of
which were logged in Ten years from 1900-1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the logs were
cut, machinery was sold, houses were moved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and little was
left of one of the largest logging operations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the history of
Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is part of
the Off Beat Michigan cache series.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After you find the cache find your way to say hello to the resident African Gray Parrot at Arts and Adventure Paddlesports at BrassWind Landing. These birds can mimic any sound or voice.  He might wolf whistle at you! He also says Pretty Bird and  Good Girl. If you can whistle well he will respond. (We apologize in advance for his favorite Squeaky brake noise - it's not the door entrance alarm) Stop in the BrassWind Art Gallery and decide which bronze sculpture is your favorite.  Are hand made wood boats more your kind of art? We have those too! We are open Wednesday thru Sunday from 10am - 5pm. If you you have been to Dairy Queen or Drost's Chocolates for Ice Cream you are welcome to bring it along and browse. The cat is friendly. You can reach this cache in a wheelchair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indian River is situated along the Indian River near Burt Lake, Michigan. The Inland waterway runs from Crooked Lake through Burt Lake, Indian River, Mullett Lake and on up to Cheboygan, Michigan and Lake Huron near the Mackinac Bridge.  Lots of opportunity to walk down to the river or the lake from our cache. It's 3 blocks either way from this cache. Indian River is known as a recreational area for boating, kayaking, canoeing, paddle boarding and more. It is nestled between 2 of the largest Inland Lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just across 1 block away is the Rail Trail and bike path. Come by bike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indian River is also home to the largest wood cross in the world. The Cross in the Woods National Shrine is one of Michigan's best known and most visited shrines. The Cross in the Woods is staffed by Franciscan Friars of the Sacred Heart, St. Louis, MO Province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You can just see Burt Lake through the tunnel of trees on Mack Ave in the village of Indian River. Years ago the glaciers left ledge stone in Petoskey. Some has been transported to Indian River and has been used in landscaping along the North side of Mack Avenue just past the blue roofed kayak rental and paddlesports store and art gallery gift shop; west of Straits Highway in the village of Indian River. Look for the large rocks on right. You may park in the parking lot or along the road. Enjoy. PS. The aerial map is outdated. Landscaping and parking lot added in 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also enjoy a walk through the village on your way to find the cache. Walk 2 blocks further down Mack and you are right next to Burt Lake where you can enjoy a beautiful sunset or a swim at DeVoe Beach just to the North. (access beach by car from Witt)    </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look near vertical rocks along the large rock landscaping.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This location is simple enough to find, although being a micro size container big enough for some paper and a small pencil it's hidden quite well.  There are many possible spots where it could be.  There is no climbing involved, just be sure to wear good shoes and pants.  After you find the cache stay and enjoy the park, river and view of Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a container hikers use to store matches.  I left it bright orange so it wouldn't be too hard to find. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A cache for my native brother. After over a decade of losing track
of each other, we are in close contact again. We showed him what
geocaching was all about today and hid one in his neighbourhood for
him to look for.
&lt;p&gt;Cache container is a 35mm film container containing a toonie for
the FTF'er.&lt;/p&gt;
