North of this location (across the street), there is a monument erected in his honor which is located behind the historic Trinity Episcopal Church. West of the cache's location is the Gorrie Museum. So plan to stay a few minutes and see everything about the inventor of the ice machine.

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the mouth of the Apalachicola River
in Apalachicola, Florida. The path to access this cache is the
actual path of the old turn-style John Gorrie bridge which was
replaced in the 80's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Gorrie is considered the father of air conditioning and
refrigeration and represents Florida with his statue placed in the
National Statuary Hall in Washington D.C. More information about
Dr. John Gorrie can be found at http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/gorrie.cfm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to check out Dr. Gorrie's other cache location,&lt;br/&gt;

The location of the cache is at the old Franklin County Jail which is now a boarded up building. It was in use until some time in the 80's when a much larger and more modern facility in the adjacent town of Eastpoint started being used.

Of note is the stone work and engraving on both the Jail and the Court House next door.</groundspeak:long_description>

I haven't hidden a cache in a while so I thought I would give you a decent cache to hunt.

As with all caches, please do not leave any spoilers in your log (even if encrypted) so that others can have the same amount of &quot;fun&quot; as you did hunting this cache.

 I was out doing a bit of caching and I stumbled upon this spot.  Looked like a perfect spot to leave a pirate cache.  The tree coverage makes it a little tough in spots, find some sky and take note of the bearing.

It looks like people have been fishing out here, so if you're interested, bring your poles and wigglers.

First To Find Prize is a Piece of Fools Gold!

Happy Hunting.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In honor of the Chattahoochee Valley Cachers 2nd Anniversary we
placed this nano cache for the greatest of all geocaching
groups!!!

After leaving the 2nd Anniversary event today, and having such a
wonderful time with these great folks, we were riding down the road
and thinking about the great time that was had by all, and somehow
came up with the idea to place this cache. I'm not sure what it was
that made me think of it. I thought I had heard my wife suggest it,
but she later admitted that she hadn't, but it was my idea. I don't
know what it could have been that made me think of it. Possibly it
was something subliminal. But since the idea had made its way
through the convoluted parts of my brain, I thought 'MIGHT AS
WELL,' so I just went back to this spot and did it. Hope you all
like it!

Another offering in the FIRE/LOOKOUT TOWER series. This tower is
kept in nearly perfect condition. It is right next to a manned
Georgia Forestry Commission station. If you like finding these neat
structures, this one is a great specimen! 
&lt;p&gt;You will find the medium size lock n' lock box in another
location a short drive from the tower. To find the final cache, go
to the above coords and find the Tower. At the tower location,
there are two driveways, one on either side of the tower. Each has
a small blue sign with a two digit number on it. You will use these
numbers to easily find the coords for the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply multiply the two numbers XX x YY = ABCD&lt;br/&gt;
Final North Coordinates: N 32-28.468 + ABCD = N 32-??.???&lt;br/&gt;
Final West Coordinates: W084-10.660 + ABCD = W084-??.???&lt;br/&gt;
(remove the decimal point to add these numbers, then place it back
where it goes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the cache box about 1.4 miles away from the tower.
The box is placed next to a fence post, and is kind of in the open.
The terrain rating on this one has to do with briars, which may get
worse as the summer wears on. There is a very nice FTF prize for
the next week or so, as there are more blackberries in the area
than you could possibly pick, so bring a bowl if you come during
this time of year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the Muscogee Fire Tower near Columbus, Georgia. It is in
better shape than any of the towers that I have seen, although it
is secured behind security fencing to keep out tresspassers. The
tower is being used for radio equipment, as are many of these old
structures. The above coords are for the tower, and the geocache
itself is an offset cache. The tower is enclosed in fence, but
there is also a chain link fence that surrounds the yard on the
North and East sides. If you look in the NE corner, about 150'+
from the tower, you will find the LNL box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horace King, a South
Carolina native who was born in 1807, became known as a master
builder of bridges and buildings in Alabama, Georgia, and
Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 By the 1870s, King had built his famous &quot;lattice bridges&quot; over the
Chattahoochee River (at West Point, Columbus, Ft. Gaines), the
Flint River (at Albany), and the Oconee River (at Milledgeville)
and this one at Red Oak Creek, Gay.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Before the end of his life, King was even known as a political
figure, having served in the post-war Alabama Legislature as a
state representative from Russell County (1868-1872).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the 1870s, King moved to LaGrange, Georgia, where he and his
sons prospered through the work of their construction firm. King
died in 1887 and is buried in LaGrange’s Stonewall Cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dr. William H. Green, an authority on the life and work of Horace
King, has said of King: &quot;Laborer and legislator, his life was an
astonishing symbolic bridge - a bridge not only between states, but
between men. Like one of his stately Town lattice bridges, Horace
King’s life soars above the murky waters historical limitations, of
human bondage and racial prejudice. He did not change the currents
of social history, but he did transcend them and stands as a
reminder of our common humanity, the potential of human spirit, the
power of human respect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last
remaining example of Mr. King's skill at bridge making. A tribute
to the man and his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the First to Find!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasty
George&lt;/p&gt;

This is a simple micro-cache which needs no explanation. You are looking for a 35 mm film can. Please bring your own pencil, sign the log book, and return here for your smiley!

designed to be fun for the whole family.
Most of your walk is along a paved path,
then a few feet into a small forest area.
Plan a picnic! Schnippi is a crocodile who
loves to Geocache. Let's go find him! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;[UPDATE: June 8, 2011]:&lt;br/&gt;
VERY IMPORTANT:  The Opencaching App's internal software &quot;compass&quot; is 90 degrees off on Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the newest tablets.  Compare the compass with an ordinary handheld compass, before caching, to be sure it's correct on your phone or tablet.&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is in the soccer complex, so 
don't cross No Trespassing signs.
Park in the parking lot at:&lt;br/&gt;
N 33° 27.361 W 084° 24.679&lt;br/&gt;
and you can walk to the cache without crossing
soccer fields (which have “keep off” signs
at times). There's a high fence and wall
separating the park from private property,
so stay on the park side.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I cross-listed this Geocaching.com cache
here mainly to test my Acer A500 Android
tablet and the Opencaching App. After all
the testing, and unless you're very familiar with using an Android device and its compass, I would highly advise instead using
a handheld “hiking” style GPS (set to &quot;hiking&quot; or &quot;pedestrian&quot; mode) for caching, not an Android device, or at least bring
a printout of Google Maps' satellite view
(note that Opencaching only uses Bing Maps).
Many Android tablets have compass problems
when using caching Apps (my Android, too),
that will make some caches tough or impossible
to find.  You may contact me (kunarion) using the member messaging system on geocaching.com, but be aware that there may be no way for me to contact you on Opencaching,com, if there's an issue.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;

      READ ALL ABOUT IT!!! -- ***The Cache is NOT at the above
      coordinates***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things in this world that can make
      Superman weak in the knees. One is a green, glowing rock that
      just happens to be a radioactive chunk of his demolished home
      planet. The other is a brunette reporter with a nose for news
      and the initials L.L. For years, Clark Kent has tried to
      balance the fact that Superman belongs to the world with his
      desire to live a normal life with the woman of his dreams,
      Lois Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Lois was around from the very beginning - her first comic book
appearance was the same as Superman's. Miss Lane and the Man of
Steel both made their debut in Action Comics #1 in June of 1938.
Clark seemed to have a thing for Lois right away. He asks her on a
date in that first issue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Superman can stop bullets and leap tall
buildings, it's Lois who has proven to be a true challenge for our
hero. Right from the start, she caught the attention of one of the
most powerful men in the universe, and he's been flying after her
ever since (usually to save her from danger). No matter who has
stepped into the role over the years, there has always been one
enduring and endearing quality about Lois Lane... she is the one
who gives Superman his humanity, because his dream for a normal
life as Clark Kent only makes sense with her by his
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more SUPER faces of Lois
Lane...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT at the
coordinates above, but to find Lois you will need to visit these
coordinates... but you must use your super powers to do so...
Driving to the first stage is a real waste of your time, so don't!
This is a mystery / puzzle cache, and your job is to solve the
mystery. Don't make it harder than it really is! Decoded the name
found at the above coordinates for the coordinates to the final
stage of this cache. Use the first word of the code name and find
the numeric values of the letters (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.) Mulitply
these four numbers to find a 5 digit number and then use the digits
of that number to fill in the missing coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;___ X ___ X ___ X ___ = ABCDE&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;NORTH 3A-B6.A1D BY WEST 085-EC.A1E&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don't need X-ray
vision to find the final cache, but you might need some super
help.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Getting there is the real challenge on this one. Do NOT try to do

We (me, Team PEZ and Code Hiker) simply could not find this cache.  Phone-a-friend attempts pointed us in the direction we all thought the cache should be in, but there was no joy. Martin's name was thoroughly dragged the mud for the rest of the day today.

A Local stopped us and asked us if we were looking for a diamond ring.  Maybe he was interested in collecting a &quot;ree-ward&quot; so he could buy some replacement teeth for the ones he was missing... </groundspeak:text>

any additional information on this one for now. Let's see how this
one goes... It's more difficult than most of my others, but was
found the first morning it was available by &lt;b&gt;AtlantaGal&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;Cymbaline&lt;/b&gt; -- &lt;b&gt;FTF!!!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
*First
to Find Honors go to: &lt;b&gt;AtlantaGal
&amp;
Cymbaline&lt;/b&gt;!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Americans seem transfixed on knowing where they are, especially&lt;br/&gt;wanting to know the center of different geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the Mid-West, of course, which some call Mid-America.&lt;br/&gt;Here in our state, we call the area around Macon, Middle Georgia.&lt;br/&gt;Augusta used the moniker the Central Savannah River Area. In&lt;br/&gt;Atlanta, there is Midtown, and there's a city called Midway, which&lt;br/&gt;is halfway between Colonial Savannah and its southern outpost at&lt;br/&gt;Darien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where, then, is the center of Gwinnett County?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to go about finding it: we have to find the centroid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the geographic land parcel in the center of the&lt;br/&gt;county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some background here: in the late 1950's and early 1960's, the&lt;br/&gt;early development of Gwinnett County was focused around the county&lt;br/&gt;becoming a distribution point for Georgia and the Southeast, which&lt;br/&gt;still continues today. Because of the accessibility of&lt;br/&gt;Interstate-85 and the railroads, firms found Gwinnett County ideal,&lt;br/&gt;especially as land prices were low. Even today, 20 percent of the&lt;br/&gt;labor force is involved in distribution from Gwinnett County&lt;br/&gt;locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is fitting, therefore, that the land parcel in the exact&lt;br/&gt;center of the county is at the far back of a warehouse. It is&lt;br/&gt;located just a little west of Lawrenceville, in the right-of-way&lt;br/&gt;for SR 316.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, thousands drive by the center of Gwinnett County&lt;br/&gt;without realizing it. When entering Highway 316 south from&lt;br/&gt;Riverside Parkway, the land is on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when the founding fathers of Gwinnett at the temporary&lt;br/&gt;courthouse near Dacula were seeking property to found the county&lt;br/&gt;seat, they wanted to select a spot in the middle of the county, for&lt;br/&gt;the ease of early settlers to get to the courthouse. They wanted it&lt;br/&gt;to be within a half day's horseback ride. (That's the reason we&lt;br/&gt;have so many counties in Georgia, more than any state except Texas.&lt;br/&gt;Remember, Georgia is the largest state east of the Mississippi&lt;br/&gt;River.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early Gwinnett fathers did a pretty good job of picking the&lt;br/&gt;middle of the county. The exact center is &quot;14,339 feet from the&lt;br/&gt;Gwinnett Justice &amp; Administration Center building.&quot; That's 2.7&lt;br/&gt;miles! Pretty good siting for a county seat!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know the exact location of the center of Gwinnett&lt;br/&gt;County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTF gets a presidential reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: PK1WV7D - Parking for Centroid!&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Closest parking in the very back of the warehouse at 1300 Lakes Parkway.  This will put you about 180 ft from the cache.  That is way safer than parking on SR 316 and jumping the shallow 8 ft tributary to the Yellow River!&lt;br/&gt;TH1WV7D - Alternative Trailhead - walking on easement road&lt;br/&gt;N 33° 57.774 W 084° 02.322&lt;br/&gt;Alternative Trailhead - walking on easement dirt road.

The serpent tempted man to disobey God and brought sin and death into the world. Thus this cache is located between where many are laid to rest as a result of earthly death and where many, many others have discovered and celebrate the ultimate gift of eternal life. 
Note: It is NOT in the cemetary, please be respectful of those at rest and their families. Permission granted to place this cache.

Although snakes are generally found at ground level, this one isn't so there is no need to disassemble walls or piles of bricks. It will make sense when you find it!

Beware of muggles during school hours and Sundays.

Congratulations to doctor mole for the FTF!

Welcome to the Big Creek Greenway. Presently the Greenway extends approximately seven miles from McFarland Road to Bethelview Road – passing through Fowler Park along Highway 9. 
This is the first cache along the newest section of the Big Creek Greenway. Only attempt to access this cache from the Greenway – DO NOT attempt access from the adjacent business properties. The nearest trailhead parking coordinates are listed below. Traffic along the Greenway may require an exceptional amount of stealth.

The path to the Greenway from the parking lot is not complete and currently consists of a large gravel path. Once you reach the Greenway it is a nice concrete/boardwalk stroll until you approach the cache – where you have to leave the Greenway. Walking/biking distance to the cache is well over half a mile.

The Greenway is subject to flooding, however, the cache should be protected from all but the most severe flood conditions. Access to the Greenway may be closed during flood conditions requiring that you delay your caching gratification until another day – at least for this particular cache.

I have seen deer along the Greenway and you may encounter other furry, feathered, or scaled creatures. Also watch out for vicious plants.

Congratulations to andy2049 for FTF.

Trailhead parking is at N 34° 06.513 W 084° 13.090.</groundspeak:long_description>

Welcome to the Big Creek Greenway.  Presently the Greenway extends approximately seven miles from McFarland Road to Bethelview Road – passing through the future Fowler Park along Highway 9.  Only attempt to access this cache from the Greenway – DO NOT attempt access from the adjacent business properties or GA 400.  

Traffic along the Greenway may require an exceptional amount of stealth.  Many people like to walk their dogs along the greenway.  As you proceed about a mile down the greenway, your GPS will detect the chirp™ and give you the required information to proceed to your final destination.  Remember to keep your dog on a leash and always be considerate of others.

About a mile from the Bethelview Road parking lot you will make a slight detour off the paved path to find the hidden bounty.  Watch out for muggles and crazy cyclists during peak hours.  Carefully choose your path and you will meet little resistance, choose poorly and the difficulty may be a 4! </groundspeak:long_description>

I was rather disappointed to note that there is not a cache here anymore.  So, in an effort to encourage my Georgia caching friends to come up to Chattanooga, I placed this cache here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, if you're just passing through, you can stop here and find this cache too.  This is a good place to stop and stretch your legs.  There's extra bathroom facilities here, in case it's busy... and there's lots of parking!  You can even stop for a picnic here, lots of picnic tables.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy this quick and easy cache and if you're planning on caching in Chattanooga... let me know! ;)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No this isn't Britton Hill. It's a new series of caches exploring America's highest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, there will be no useless trivia, just the facts ma'am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida at 345ft above sea level. Many Florida skyscrapers are taller; as of 2010, the roof of the Four Seasons Hotel Miami is the highest non-natural point in Florida. Topping out at 789 feet, the tower is more than twice as high as Britton Hill. Britton Hill is the lowest state highpoint in the United States, 103 feet lower than the next lowest highpoint, Ebright Azimuth in Delaware. It is even lower than the highest point in Washington D.C., Tenleytown, at 429 feet. The lowest points of 16 U.S. states are higher than Britton Hill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Brasstown Bald.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

JUST A NOTE: If you're going after this cache you're obviously not on a numbers run so please take the time to hide this one back really well. It can be exposed on a couple of different sides. Looks like this place gets camped and hunted so PLEASE take an extra second and hide it back good!

I made the mistake of asking my dad (Team Geologynut) why they call this a weir dam. He started telling me that most of the time this is just a regular dam but when there's a full moon out it starts acting strange and transforms into a weir dam. Give me a break!!

You are looking for an ammo can hidden in a likely spot. The trail up is a little slippery so be careful. Please hide it back better than you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a wonderful memorial for a great man, Karl Edison Steinmetz. I'm not going to quote the plaque, you can read it yourself but this man had a lot to do with the creation of the Tellico Wildlife Management Area.

For some reason I couldn't get very good coords here so I'll leave a &quot;giveaway&quot; hint for you. Bring a pen or pencil and please use stealth if people are near. You're looking for a large bison tube.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mount Magazine is the highest point in Arkansas at 2,753ft above sea level. Mount Magazine is the name commonly used for the tallest mountain in the state of Arkansas and is the site of Arkansas's newest state park.

Brasstown Bald is the highest point in Georgia at 4,784ft above sea level. The mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah. It is named for the former Cherokee village of Brasstown, Georgia, located along the upper Brasstown Creek. Brasstown Bald is partly in Towns and partly in Union counties, the peak being divided by the county line. The mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, (part of the Appalachian Mountains), and within the borders of the Blue Ridge Ranger District of the Chattahoochee National Forest. The mountain is mostly made up of soapstone and dunite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Mauna Kea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Welcome to a new series of caches that are way out of the way. You are riding down Citico Rd. You can park within 100ft of the cache. You park pretty close to a nice looking, un-named waterfall. I take that back, it has a name now, Geologynut Falls (lol). You don't have to cross the creek to get to the cache (we did) but you do need to climb up a little hill. You are looking for a Lock&amp;Lock container with a log and some trade items but NO PEN (sorry). Enjoy the ride!</groundspeak:long_description>

I brought my own pen and signed the little log book with my name, cell phone # and date.  I was the first entry.  I took nothing out and didn't add anything, either.

I think I'll move on to Mt Pleasant caches next.   </groundspeak:text>

Looking for a really challenging cache? This isn't it!

Looking for a magnificent location with a beautiful view? This
isn't it!

Looking for a cache where you can drop off some travel bugs This
isn't it!

Looking for a nice, easy cache that doesn't involve a walk in the
woods? This IS it! You won't get any ticks here, your shoes won't
get dirty,and unless you are really, really directionally
challenged, you won't spend very long looking for this cache.

Convenient parking nearby.

&lt;b&gt;If you hate micros, just don't stop!&lt;/b&gt; Otherwise, I hope you
have fun, and happy caching!

In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on top of the log.


The Lesser Known Facts

1) The official state fish is the Largemouth Bass

2) Home to the first college in the World chartered to grant degrees to women

3) Home to the world’s largest infantry training center

4) Has the only natural forest within a city limit in the United States


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

Looking for a really challenging cache? This isn't it!

Looking for a magnificent location with a beautiful view? This isn't it!

Looking for a cache where you can drop off some travel bugs This isn't it!

Looking for a nice, easy cache that doesn't involve a walk in the woods? This IS it! You won't get any ticks here, your shoes won't get dirty,and unless you are really, really directionally challenged, you won't spend very long looking for this cache.

Convenient parking nearby.

&lt;b&gt;If you hate micros, just don't stop!&lt;/b&gt; Otherwise, I hope you have fun, and happy caching!

Welcome to a new series of caches that are way out of the way. This cache is across the road from a great little camping spot right on the lake made possible by Tapoco. There's a picnic table, fire pit, trash cans, and a cool little surprise I'll let you discover. You are looking for a camoed sandwich sized Lock&amp;Lock filled with some cheap goodies. Enjoy the ride!

After using it on about 80-something caches, I was informed that the ink bleeds off the page when the log got wet. Sooooo, after a lot of checking and rechecking of my gsak info, I left the house with a list in hand to go back and resign those caches.

Every trip out here has been at night but someday I'd like to come back in daylight to enjoy the area as well as more caching. Thanks for placing caches for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the state quarter series. I’ll be hiding 50 caches, one for each state quarter. In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. 


The Lesser Known Facts

1) Produces more apples than any other state in the nation

2) Home to the oldest operating gas station in the US

3) 90% of the nation’s red raspberries come from here

4) 75% of the nation’s hops are produced here

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Snake Boy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There was a boy who used to go bird hunting every day, and all the
birds he brought home he gave to his grandmother, who was very fond
of him. This made the rest of the family jealous, and they treated
him in such fashion that at last one day he told his grandmother he
would leave them all, but that she must not grieve for him. Next
morning he refused to eat any breakfast, but went off hungry to the
woods and was gone all day. In the evening he returned, bringing
with him a pair of deer horns, and went directly to the hothouse
(âsï), where his grandmother was waiting for him. He told the old
woman he must be alone that night, so she got up and went into the
house where the others were.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At early daybreak she came again to the hothouse and looked in, and
there she saw an immense uktena that filled the âsï, with horns on
its head, but still with two human legs instead of a snake tail. It
was all that was left of her boy. He spoke to her and told her to
leave him, and she went away again from the door. When the sun was
well up, the uktena began slowly to crawl out, but it was full noon
before it was all out of the âsï. It made a terrible hissing noise
as it came out, and all the people ran from it. It crawled on
through the settlement, leaving a broad trail in the ground behind
it, until it came to a deep bend in the river, where it plunged in
and went under the water.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The grandmother grieved much for her boy, until the others of the
family got angry and told her that as she thought so much of him
she ought to go and stay with him. So she left them and went along
the trail made by the uktena to the river and walked directly into
the water and disappeared. Once after that a man fishing near the
place saw her sitting on a large rock in the river, looking just as
she had always looked, but as soon as she caught sight of him she
jumped into the water and was gone.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is in the Carson Island Boat Ramp area. A 4x4 gets you
close, an ATV gets you closer! This area is heavily used by the
less evolved so trash is everywhere. There is also poison ivy close
to the cache so beware. You are looking for a flare tube. Please
hide it back well. If you are in a hurry please skip this
one!&lt;/p&gt;

Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Red Man And The Uktena.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Two brothers went hunting together, and when they came to a good
camping place in the mountains they made a fire, and while one
gathered bark to put up a shelter the other started up the creek to
look for a deer. Soon he heard a noise on the top of the ridge as
if two animals were fighting. He hurried through the bushes to see
what it might be, and when he came to the spot he found a great
uktena coiled around a man and choking him to death. The man was
fighting for his life, and called out to the hunter: &quot;Help me,
nephew; he is your enemy as well as mine.&quot; The hunter took good
aim, and, drawing the arrow to the head, sent it through the body
of the uktena, so that the blood spouted from the hole. The snake
loosed its coils with a snapping noise, and went tumbling down the
ridge into the valley, tearing up the earth like a water spout as
it rolled.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The stranger stood up, and it was the Asga'ya Gi'gägeï, the Red Man
of the Lightning. He said to the hunter: &quot;You have helped me, and
now I will reward you, and give you a medicine so that you can
always find game.&quot; They waited until it was dark, and then went
down the ridge to where the dead uktena had rolled, but by this
time the birds and insects had eaten the body and only the bones
were left. In one place were flashes of light coming up from the
ground, and on digging here, just under the surface, the Red Man
found a scale of the uktena. Next he went over to a tree that had
been struck by lightning, and gathering a handful of splinters he
made a fire and burned the uktena scale to a coal. He wrapped this
in a piece of deerskin and gave it to the hunter, saying: &quot;As long
as you keep this you can always kill game.&quot; Then he told the hunter
that when he went back to camp he must hang up the medicine on a
tree outside, because it was very strong and dangerous. He told him
also that when he went into the cabin he would find his brother
lying inside nearly dead on account of the presence of the uktena's
scale, but he must take a small piece of cane, which the Red Man
gave him, and scrape a little of it into water and give it to his
brother to drink and he would be well again. Then the Red Man was
gone, and the hunter could not see where he went. He returned to
camp alone, and found his brother very sick, but soon cured him
with the medicine from the cane, and that, day and the next, and
every day after, he found game whenever he went for it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is in the Carson Island Boat Ramp area. A 4x4 or a 2whl
drive with good clearance gets you close. Once again those who have
not made the climb up the evolutionary ladder hang out here so
beautiful views are marred by trash. You are looking for a flare
tube. Please hide this one back well. If you are in a hurry please
skip this one!&lt;/p&gt;

Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Tsundige'wï.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once some young men of the Cherokee set out to see what was in the
world and traveled south until they came to a tribe of little
people called Tsundige'wï, with very queer shaped bodies, hardly
tall enough to reach up to a man's knee, who had no houses, but
lived in nests scooped in the sand and covered over with dried
grass. The little fellows were so weak and puny that they could not
fight at all, and were in constant terror from the wild geese and
other birds that used to come in great flocks from the south to
make war upon them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Just at the time that the travelers got there they found the little
men in great fear, because there was a strong wind blowing from the
south and it blew white feathers and down along the sand, so that
the Tsundige'wï knew their enemies were coming not far behind. The
Cherokee asked them why, they did not defend themselves, but they
said they could not, because they did not know how. There was no
time to make bows and arrows, but the travelers told them to take
sticks for clubs, and showed them where to strike the birds on the
necks to kill them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The wind blew for several days, and at last the birds came, so many
that they were like a great cloud in the air, and alighted on the
sands. The little men ran to their nests, and the birds followed
and stuck in their long bills to pull them out and eat them. This
time. though, the Tsundige'wï had their clubs, and they struck the
birds on the neck, as the Cherokee had shown them, and killed so
many that at last the others were glad to spread their wings and
fly away again to the south.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The little men thanked the Cherokee for their help and gave them
the best they had until the travelers went on to see the other
tribes. They heard afterwards that the birds came again several
times, but that the Tsundige'wï always drove them off with their
clubs, until a flock of sandhill cranes came. They were so tall
that the little men could not reach up to strike them on the neck,
and so at last the cranes killed them all.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mrs. Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their traditions, stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of the Tlanuwa. You may know it better by Thunderbird.

The legend of the “Tlanuwa,” or the “Great Mythic Hawk,” is a Cherokee variation of the Thunderbird and Piasa Bird myths found in other Native American cultures. Tlanuwa were a pair of immense raptors said to live in the caves of a high cliff just below the mouth of Citco Creek on the north bank of the Little Tennessee River in Blount County. According to legend, they flew up and down the river in search of prey, even coming into villages and carrying off dogs and small children. In one famous incident, Daniel Boone claimed to have seen a giant raptor on the Tennessee River near where the Cherokee claimed the Tlanuwa made its home.

The cache is in the area where these sighting have been reported. The Lock&amp;Lock container is hidden on land once owned by the Cherokee before it was stolen by us. It now belongs to TVA. Please use the parking coords and don't completely block the gate.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of The Corn Woman.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cooking is an important part of life for the Cherokee woman. Not only is it necessary for life and nourishment, but it is part of the social fabric. Even in our traditional story of first man and first woman, Selu is known as &quot;Corn Woman.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selu lived with her husband, Kanati, and two sons. Everyday, she would go away from the house and return with a basket full of corn. The boys wondered where the corn came from, so they followed her one day They saw her go into a storehouse, and they peeked in and watched her.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There they saw her place her basket and shake herself. The corn started falling from her body into the basket. They thought that their mother must surely be a witch and that they must destroy her!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selu could read the boys' thoughts. She told them that after they put her to death, they would need to follow her instructions carefully so that they would continue to have corn for nourishment.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;After you kill me, you must clear some ground in front of our house. Drag my body in a circle seven times. Then, you must stay up all night and watch.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;

carries the clan, gives nourishment to the growing baby, continues its growth by providing her milk, and continues to nourish all who come to her home by providing lovingly prepared food.&lt;br/&gt;

***JUST A NOTE***

This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods that don't get found that often, go find them!

Jesus performed this many recorded miracles.
The atomic number for arsenic.
Pope John Paul 1 was pope for this many days.

Find the number these three have in common and you will find the cache.

***JUST A NOTE***

This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods that don't get found that often, go find them!

Thanks and HAPPY CACHING!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No this isn't Mount McKinley. It's a new series of caches exploring America's highest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, there will be no useless trivia, just the facts ma'am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Mount McKinley or Denali (Koyukon Athabaskan for &quot;The High One&quot;, Dghelaayce’e in Ahtna) in Alaska, United States is the highest mountain peak in North America and the United States, with a summit elevation of 20,320 feet above sea level. It is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Humphreys Peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This little park is called Wildcat Point. The gate closes at sunset so keep that in mind when finding this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Note: The gate to Wildcat Point remains closed from November 1st until March. This only means that the parking lot and rest rooms are closed after they have been winterized, according to the TRDA who operates the park. While the rest rooms are unavailable during this period, you may walk around the gate and take the short walk to the trail without trespassing.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mrs. Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the Origin of the Pleiades and the Pine.

Long ago, when the world was new, there were seven boys who used to spend all their time down by the townhouse playing the gatayû'stï game, rolling a stone wheel along the ground and sliding a curved stick after it to strike it. Their mothers scolded, but it did no good, so one day they collected some gatayû'stï stones and boiled them in the pot with the corn for dinner. When the boys came home hungry their mothers dipped out the stones and said, &quot;Since you like the gatayû'stï better than the cornfield, take the stones now for your dinner.&quot;

The boys were very angry, and went down to the townhouse, saying, &quot;As our mothers treat us this way, let us go where we shall never trouble them any more.&quot; They began a dance--some say it was the Feather dance-and went round and round the townhouse, praying to the spirits to help them. At last their mothers were afraid something was wrong and went out to look for them. They saw the boys still dancing around the townhouse, and as they watched they noticed that their feet were off the earth, and that with every round they rose higher and higher in the air. They ran to get their children, but it was too late, for then, were already above the roof of the townhouse--all but one, whose mother managed to pull him down with the gatayû'stï pole, but he struck the ground with such force that he sank into it and the earth closed over him.

The other six circled higher and higher until they went up to the sky, where we see them now as the Pleiades, which the Cherokee still call Ani'tsutsä (The Boys). The people grieved long after them, but the mother whose boy had gone into the ground came every morning and every evening to cry over the spot until the earth was damp with her tears. At last a little green shoot sprouted up and grew day by day until it became the tall tree that we call now the pine, and the pine is of the same nature as the stars and holds in itself the same bright light.

Unless you have a large 4X4 with a lot of meat under it I'd use my parking waypoint. Very nice walk from parkig area. You'll be walking down Riden Rd. This is Federal Land (TVA) and open tp the public but they've cut down some large trees to go across the road to keep people from dumping trash back there. There's a way to get almost all the way to this cache but like I said, you'll need something bigger than the family SUV. If you do choose the 4x4 path you'll have to find it on your own, I'm not telling where it starts. I took 1000 readings with the GPS and got it down to 7ft.

The Lesser Known Facts

1) The movie “Hard Rain” was filmed here

2) You may not know it but it’s considered a Great Lakes State

3) Home to an Olympic swimmer who won 7 gold medals in 1972

4) At one time, Duesenbergs, Auburns, Stutzes, and Maxwells were built here


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1889 the Bat Creek Stone was excavated from an undisturbed burial mound by the Smithsonian's Mound Survey project. Cyrus Thomas, the director for the project initially declared that the curious inscription on the stone were &quot;beyond question letters of the Cherokee alphabet.&quot; (Thomas 1894: 391:4),

Later, in 1960 a group confirmed that is was Semitic, specifically Paleo-Hebrew of approximately the first or second century A.D. Reading right to left it was translated &quot;for the Judeans&quot; or &quot;Only for the Judeans.&quot;

In 2002, a group of researchers announced that the Bat Creek stone is in fact inscribed with the the ancient Welsh Coelbren alphabet, and reads, in Welsh, &quot;Madoc the ruler he is.&quot; These authors identify the Bat Creek tumulus as &quot;the likely tomb of Prince Madoc&quot; (Wilson et al. 2002). Madoc was a Welsh prince who is reputed to have sailed to America in 1170 A.D. Some maintain that he was in fact a brother of King Arthur II, and sailed in 562 A.D. This would reconcile their reading of the inscription with the C-14 date of 32 A.D. - 769 A.D.

So what do you think, Cherokee, Hebrew, or Welsh? You can go to the McClung Museum on the UT campus free of charge and see the stone for yourself ( I highly recommend a visit!)

Now for the cache. You follow a really nice atv trail all the way to the cache. At the parking area your gps will say .66 to the cache. That only works if you can fly (Red Bull will not work here!) It's actually about a 2.5 mile round trip hike. Like I said, this is an atv trail so there are no switchbacks. When you come to a hill you go straight up! I've given this cache a 4 terrain rating (a little steep if you ask me, no pun intended) but you will be climbing some hills. In fact one of them is called High Top, Hmmm! You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can. The original mounds have been flattened and the woods have grown up since 1889 but from the research I've done, the cache is hidden VERY close to where the Bat Creek Stone was found in 1889. There will be 3 other caches hidden on this trail soon so you can wait and get them all or if you're an FTF hound, plan on a couple of hikes up and down this trail.

This cache is at a spot on the trail where you can view the destruction, whoops I mean the development of this beautiful area. What's funny to me is that developers try to make the destruction of beautiful land okay by naming these neighborhoods after something historical around it. You are looking at Mialaquo Point. Sorry developers, you got this one wrong, it's Mialoquo which means &quot;Big Island&quot; in the Cherokee language. Anyway, I'm bringing you here to enjoy this piece of undeveloped land.


A little history of Mialoquo if you're interested. Mialoquo (also &quot;Malaquo&quot;, &quot;Big Island&quot;, or &quot;Great Island&quot;) was a prehistoric and historic Native American site in Monroe County. The site saw significant periods of occupation during the Mississippian period (c. 1000-1600 A.D.) and later as a Cherokee refugee village. While the archaeological site of Mialoquo was situated on the southwest bank of the Little Tennessee River, the village's habitation area probably included part of Rose Island, a large island in the river immediately opposite the site. Rose Island was occupied on at least a semi-permanent basis as early as the Middle Archaic period.

Both the Mialoquo site and Rose Island are now submerged by the Tellico Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River. The area is now managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. Both sites are visible looking north from the U.S. Route 411 bridge over the river in Vonore or looking west from Wildcat Point, a cliff on the eastern bank of the river.

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Mount Elbert.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mrs. Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of how Flint Visits the Rabbit.

In the old days Täwi'skälä (Flint) lived up in the mountains, and all the animals hated him because he had helped to kill so many of them. They used to get together to talk over means to put him out of the way, but everybody was afraid to venture near his house until the Rabbit, who was the boldest leader among them, offered to go after Flint and try to kill him. They told him where to find him, and the Rabbit set out and at last came to Flint's house.

Flint was standing at his door when the Rabbit came up and said, sneeringly, &quot;Siyu'! Hello! Are you the fellow they call Flint?&quot; &quot;Yes; that's what they call me,&quot; answered Flint. &quot;Is this where you live?&quot; &quot;Yes; this is where I live.&quot; All this time the Rabbit was looking about the place trying to study out some plan to take Flint off his guard. He had expected Flint to invite him into the house, so he waited a little while, but when Flint made no move, he said, &quot;Well, my name is Rabbit; I've heard a good deal about you, so I came to invite you to come and see me.&quot;

Flint wanted to know where the Rabbit's house was, and he told him it was down in the broom-grass field near the river. So Flint promised to make him a visit in a few days. &quot;Why not come now and have supper with me?&quot; said the Rabbit, and after a little coaxing Flint agreed and the two started down the mountain together.

When they came near the Rabbit's hole the Rabbit said, &quot;There is my house, but in summer I generally stay outside here where it is cooler.&quot; So he made a fire, and they had their supper on the grass. When it was over, Flint stretched out to rest and the Rabbit got some heavy sticks and his knife and cut out a mallet and wedge. Flint looked up and asked what that was for. &quot;Oh,&quot; said the Rabbit, &quot;I like to be doing something, and they may come handy.&quot; So Flint lay down again, and pretty soon he was sound asleep. The Rabbit spoke to him once or twice to make sure, but there was no answer. Then he came over to Flint and with one good blow of the mallet he drove the sharp stake into his body and ran with all his might for his own hole; but before he reached it there was a loud explosion, and pieces of flint flew all about. That is why we find flint in so many places now. One piece struck the Rabbit from behind and cut him just as he dived into his hole. He sat listening until everything seemed quiet again. Then he put his head out to look around, but just at that moment another piece fell and struck him on the lip and split it, as we still see it.

The cache is on the Jackson Bend Branch Trail but is close to the road. Please use the parking coords and make the very easy 100ft or so hike to the cache. If you decide to get the cache from the side of the road next to it the terrain goes up and you have a good chance of injuring yourself.

You are looking for a 4x4x6 Lock&amp;Lock. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LEAVE THE TRAIL TO GRAB THIS CACHE so please cover it back up well from all angles.

***JUST A NOTE***
This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods close by that don't get found that often, go find them!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While mapping this brand new section of the East Lakeshore Trail, Pretty Little Monster and I noticed this patch of cacti. PLM thought that cacti only grew in deserts so I explained that this was probably an old home site and was planted there by the owners a long time ago. I may be wrong and it may be natural to the area. You be the judge!

This is the Jackson Bend Trail and is still under construction. It will eventually link back up with East Coast Tellico Parkway but right now it stops about .5 mile short of the road. The Lock&amp;Lock container is about 1.5 miles down the trail. If you park at the Lotterdale Trail Head (seasonal) the walk to the cache is pretty easy. Using the Jackson Bend Trail Head (year round)adds another half star to the terrain.

If you plan on exploring the whole trail I must tell you that about .4 mile past the cache site the trail gets pretty steep in places from the 2 mile marker to almost the 3 mile marker. If I were to hide a cache in this area (hint, hint) it would be a 3.5 to 4 terrain. The trail should be complete by Fall 2011 so parking a vehicle at each trailhead makes the hike easier! I update the page as needed. Things we saw and heard while mapping this trail were: deer, owls, incredible rock outcroppings and formations, we also heard an eagle but never saw it. PLEASE HIDE IT BACK GOOD!</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache From Teeters Rd!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Origin Of Strawberries.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When the first man was created and a mate was given to him, they
lived together very happily for a time, but then began to quarrel,
until at last the woman left her husband and started off toward
Nûñâgûñ'yï, the Sun land, in the east. The man followed alone and
grieving, but the woman kept on steadily ahead and never looked
behind, until Une'`länûñ'hï, the great Apportioner (the Sun), took
pity on him and asked him if he was still angry with his wife. He
said he was not, and Une'`länûñ'hï then asked him if he would like
to have her back again, to which he eagerly answered yes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So Une'`länûñ'hï caused a patch of the finest ripe huckleberries to
spring up along the path in front of the woman, but she passed by
without paving any attention to them. Farther on he put a clump Of
blackberries, but these also she refused to notice. Other fruits,
one, two, and three, and then some trees covered with beautiful red
service berries, were placed beside the path to tempt her, but she
still went on until suddenly she saw in front a patch of large ripe
strawberries, the first ever known. She stooped to gather a few to
eat, and as she picked them she chanced to turn her face to the
west, and at once the memory of her husband came back to her and
she found herself unable to go on. She sat down, but the longer she
waited the stronger became her desire, for her husband, and at last
she gathered a bunch of the finest berries and started back along
the path to give them to him. He met her kindly and they went home
together.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is on the Jackson Bend Branch Branch trail of the East
Lakeshore Trail System. Stealth may be needed in the Winter months
due to the cache area being somewhat visible from Teeters Rd with
the leaves off. You are looking for a 4x6x2 Lock&amp;Lock. Please
hide it back good. I would suggest using the Jackson Bend Branch
Trailhead.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For a PDF trail map I made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.team-geologynut.com/images/PDFs/JACKSONBEND.pdf&quot;&gt;Click
Here&lt;/a&gt; (The red dashed lines are long driveways or unnamed
streets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This trailhead is open year round, park in grass = N 35° 40.037 W 084° 13.992

This trailhead is closed during Winter months. Park in grass close to kiosk = N 35° 40.229 W 084° 14.353

The Lesser Known Facts

1) This state has the oldest population of any state (median age is 40)
2) Site of the first 4-H camp in the US
3) The first state sales tax in the US went into effect here on July 1, 1921

It would be hard to find someone who isn’t related to someone

thoughts and prayers go out to those fighting right now as well as
those who’ve lost the battle!&lt;br/&gt;

You know who you are, you find the cache at night when it says daytime only, you park in the wrong spot, you get to ground zero and don't know what you're hunting (we do that one often!) and even worse, don't read the educational part of the Earthcache, this cache is for you. The cache is not at the posted coordinates (that usually goes on top of the page so we'll see how many have already failed and are at the posted coordinates trying to not get hit by a car).

Everything you need to find the cache is in the story below. After reading it and getting the info you need, go find the .30 ammo can.

A few days ago, a bunch of us cachers got together to plan a cache run. After a long discussion we decided to go North. After planning the cache run, loading the waypoints, and grabbing some snacks, three days had passed. We couldn't believe how long that had taken us and we were about to starve. Luckily it was Cinco de Mayo so we ran down to the local Mexican eatery for some fajitas and tequila.
Four days later we recovered and were ready to cache. One thing was certain, we would need a pen.

We had a great day of caching but after four hundred miles we were pretty tired. We found a motel just West of the interstate. Some of the group wanted to swim but I had zero enegry. At about eight o'clock, four of the guys started an intense game of Uno. After three games they called it quits.

At nine the next morning we started caching home. The highlight of the trip was an incredible Earthcache. It had a moderate four mile hike that made the three terrain a little low.

After all was said and done, this cache trip was well worth the time and effort put in it!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
the Cherokee Creation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Earth is floating on the waters like a big island, hanging from
four rawhide ropes fastened at the top of the Sacred four
directions. The ropes are tied to the ceiling of the sky, which is
made of hard rock crystal. When the ropes break, this world will
come tumbling down, and all living things will fall with it and
die. Then everything will be as if the earth had never existed, for
water will cover it. Maybe the white man will bring this
about.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Well, in the beginning also, water covered everything. Though
living creatures existed, their home was up there, above the
rainbow, and it was crowded. &quot;We are all jammed together,&quot; the
animals said. &quot;We need more room.&quot; Wondering what was under the
water, they sent Water Beetle to look around.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Water Beetle skimmed over the surface but couldn't find any solid
footing, so he dived to the bottom and brought up a little dab of
soft mud. Magically the mud spread out in the four directions and
became this island we are living on – this earth. Someone
Powerful then fastened it to the sky ceiling with ropes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the beginning the earth was flat, soft, and moist. All the
animals were eager to live on it, and they kept sending down birds
to see if the mud had dried and hardened enough to take their
weight. But the birds flew back and said that there was still no
spot they could perch on.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then the animals sent Gandfather Buzzard down. He flew very close
and saw that the earth was still soft, but when he glided low over
what would become Cherokee country, he found that the mud was
getting harder. By that time Buzzard was tired and dragging. When
he flapped his wings down they made a valley where they touched the
earth; when he swept them up, they made a mountain. The animals
watching from above the rainbow said, &quot;If he keeps on, there will
only be mountains,&quot; and they made him come back. That's why we have
so many mountains in Cherokee land.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At last the earth was hard and dry enough, and the animals
descended. They couldn't see very well because they had no sun or
moon, and someone said, &quot;Lets grab Sun from up there behind the
rainbow! Lets get him down too!&quot; Pulling Sun down, they told him,
&quot;Here's a road for you,&quot; and showed him the way to go....from east
to west.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now they had light, but it was much too hot, because Sun was too
close to the earth. The crawfish had his back sticking out of a
stream, and Sun burned it red. His meat was spoiled forever, and
the people still won't eat crawfish.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Everyone asked the sorcerers, the shamans, to put Sun higher. They
pushed him up as high as a man, but it was still to hot. So they
pushed him farther, but it wasn't far enough. They tried four
times, and when they had Sun up to the height of four men, he was
just hot enough. Everyone was satisfied, so they left him
there.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Before making humans, Someone Powerful had created plants and
animals and had told them to stay awake and watch for seven days
and seven nights. (This is just what young men do today when they
fast and prepare for a ceremony). But most of the plants and
animals couldn't manage it, some fell asleep after one day, some
after two days.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Among the trees and other plants, only the cedar, pine, holly, and
laurel were still awake on the eighth morning. Someone Powerful
said to them: &quot;Because you watched and stayed awake as you had been
told, you will not lose your hair in the winter.&quot; So these plants
stay green all the time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After creating plants and animals, Someone Powerful made man and
his sister. The man poked her with a fish and told her to go give
birth. After seven days she had a baby, and after seven more days
she had another, and every seven days another came. The humans
increased so quickly that Someone Powerful, thinking there would
soon be no more room on this earth, arranged things so that a woman
could have only one child every year. And that's how it was.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now, there is still another world under the one we live on. You can
reach it by going down a spring, a water hole; but you need
underworld people to be your scouts and guide you. The world under
our earth is exactly like ours, except that it's winter down there
when its summer up here. We can see that easily, because spring
water is warmer than the air in winter and cooler than the air in
summer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is on the Lotterdale Branch trail of the East Lakeshore
Trail System. You can park on the side of the road on Carpenter
Loop close to the trail sign. The easiest way to the cache is to
follow the trail a ways till it makes a left and the old road bed
goes straight. Follow the old road bed till you get to the lake
then find the faint unmarked trail to the left. That will get you
close to the flare tube you are looking for. There is a pen in the
cache but as usual you might want to bring your own. Please take
the time to hide it back good. For a PDF trail map I made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.team-geologynut.com/images/PDFs/LotterdaleBranch.pdf&quot;&gt;Click

Welcome to the Sinking Creek Segment of the East Lakeshore Trail. This segment is a moderate hike of 4.4 miles. This cache is about .5 miles down the trail from the Sinking Creek Branch trailhead or 3.9 from the Coytee trailhead. The trail has it's ups and downs but is still pretty easy. You can park at either end of the trail or both ends with 2 or more vehicles. If you're going to hike the whole trail be sure to bring some water. Although you'll be hiking next to the water for a lot of the trail, I wouldn't drink it (Tellico Lake). I've included parking and trailhead waypoints for your caching convenience.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to
wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a small Lock&amp;Lock just beyond the &quot;Kissing Bridge&quot;. There is a mechanical pencil in the cache but you may want to bring a pen as well. Please cover it back up better than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;

Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, these will all be full size caches of various sizes and you don't have to email me anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 

Cheaha Mountain is the highest point in Alabama at 2407 ft above sea level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Mount McKinley.

This is an excellent place to have a seat and take in the beautiful view. While sitting here a hummingbird buzzed my head, hence the animated background. On topo maps, the view in front of you was called Owl Hollow. I'm sure that was a pre flood area. You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. If you are fortunate enough to come by boat, you can pull up right to the cache area. There is a TVA benchmark set in concrete close to this spot. I'll post a waypoint but you can't miss it, it's right on the trail. Please cover it back up better than you found it.

It would be hard to find someone who isn’t related to someone

As the name suggests, this cache is 3 miles down the trail from the Sinking Creek Branch trailhead or about 1.4 miles from the Coytee trailhead. You can park at either end of the trail or both ends with 2 or more vehicles. If you're going to hike the whole trail be sure to bring some water. Although you'll be hiking next to the water for a lot of the trail, I wouldn't drink it (Tellico Lake). I've included parking and trailhead waypoints for your caching convenience.

Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs.
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of Why the Possum's Tail is Bare.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Possum used to have a long, bushy tail, and was so proud of it that he combed it out every morning and sang about it at the dance, until the Rabbit, who had had no tail since the Bear pulled it out, became very jealous and made up his mind to play the Possum a trick.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There was to be a great council and a dance at which all the
animals were to be present. It was the Rabbit's business to send out the news, so as he was passing the Possum's place he stopped to ask him if he intended to be there. The Possum said he would come if he could have a special seat, &quot;because I have such a handsome tail that I ought to sit where everybody can see me.&quot; The Rabbit promised to attend to it and to send some one besides to comb and dress the Possum's tail for the dance, so the Possum was very much pleased and agreed to come.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Then the Rabbit went over to the Cricket, who is such an expert hair cutter that the Indians call him the barber, and told him to go next morning and dress the Possum's tail for the dance that night. He told the Cricket just what to do and then went on about some other mischief.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the morning the Cricket went to the Possum's house and said he had come to get him ready for the dance. So the Possum stretched himself out and shut his eyes while the Cricket combed out his tail and wrapped a red string around it to keep it smooth until night. But all this time, as he wound the string around, he was clipping off the hair close to the roots, and the Possum never knew it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When it was night the Possum went to the townhouse where the dance was to be and found the best seat ready for him, just as the Rabbit had promised. When his turn came in the dance he loosened the string from his tail and stepped into the middle of the floor. The drummers began to drum and the Possum began to sing, &quot;See my beautiful tail.&quot; Everybody shouted and he danced around the circle and sang again, &quot;See what a fine color it has.&quot; They shouted again and he danced around another time, singing, &quot;See how it sweeps the ground.&quot; The animals shouted more loudly than ever, and the Possum
was delighted. He danced around again and sang, &quot;See how fine the fur is.&quot; Then everybody laughed so long that the Possum wondered what they meant. He looked around the circle of animals and they were all laughing at him. Then he looked down at his beautiful tail and saw that there was not a hair left upon it, but that it was as bare as the tail of a lizard. He was so much astonished and ashamed that he could not say a word, but rolled over helpless on the ground and grinned, as the Possum does to this day when taken by surprise..&lt;br/&gt;

An almost 9 mile hike has been shortened to 4.4 miles. 

This bridge links the Sinking Cove Branch Trail to the Coytee Loop

here. You are looking for a magnetic Altiods tin painted to match

Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.

The name Coytee is a Cherokee word meaning gathering place. This area was once a Cherokee settlement. The Native Americans gathered in this area around a freshwater spring (now flooded) that later became known as Coytee Springs.

The Lesser Known Facts

1) In 1882 the first hydroelectric plant in the US was built here
2) The Ginseng capital of the world is here
3) The first practical typewriter was designed here in 1867
4)The jump rope capital of the world is here


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The First Fire.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the beginning there was no fire and the world was cold. Then the
Thunders (Ani'-Hyun'tikwsla'ski) who lived up in Galun'lati, sent
their lightning and put fire into the bottom of a hollow sycamore
tree which grew on an island.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The animals knew it was there, because they could see the smoke,
but they could not get to it because of the water. They held a
council to see what to do, and every animal that could fly or swim
was anxious to go after the fire. The Raven, large and strong was
sent first. He flew to the sycamore, but while he was wondering
what to do next, the fire scorched all his feathers black and he
came back without the fire. Next, the little Screech-owl (Wa'huhu')
volunteered to go, but once in the island, a blast of hot air came
up and nearly burned out his eyes. He managed to fly back home, but
his eyes are red to this day. Then the Hooting Owl ( U'guku') and
the Horned Owl (Tskili') went, but by the time they arrived, the
fire was burning so fiercely that the smoke nearly blinded them,
and the ashes carried up by the wind made white rings about their
eyes and they were never able to get rid of them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now no more birds would venture, and so the little Uksu'hi snake,
the black racer, said he would swim to the island and bring the
fire back. He swam across to the island and crawled through the
grass to the tree, and went in by a small hole at the bottom. The
heat and smoke were too much for him, and after dodging about
blindly over the hot ashes until he was almost on fire himself, he
managed to get out, but his body had been scorched black, and he
has ever since had the habit of darting and doubling on his track
as if trying to escape from close quarters. He came back, and the
great blacksnake, Gulegi, &quot;The Climber&quot;, offered to go. He swam
over to the island and climbed up tree on the outside, but when he
put his head down into the hole, the smoke choked him so that fell
into the burning stump and before he could climb out again he too
was as black as the Uksu'hi.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now they held another council, but all the animals had an excuse
for not going because they were all afraid until at last Kanane'ski
Amai'yehi (the Water Spider) said she would go. This is the water
spider with black downy hair and red stripes on her body. She can
run on top of the water or dive to the bottom, so there would be no
trouble reaching the island, but the question was, How could she
bring back the fire? &quot;I'll manage that&quot; said the Water Spider. So
she spun a thread from her body and wove it into a tusti bowl,
which she fastened on her back. Then she crossed over to the island
and through the grass to where the fire was still burning. She
placed one little coal of fire into her bowl, and came back with
it. Ever since we have had fire, and the Water Spider still keeps
her tusti bowl.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is on the Coytee Loop trail of the East Lakeshore Trail
System. You are looking for a round Lock&amp;Lock. There is room
for a couple of cars at the small parking coordinates and room for several
cars at the new Coytee Parking Area coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

The average number of heartbeats per minute for a resting adult.

Find the number these have in common and you will find the cache.

***JUST A NOTE***
This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods close by that don't get found that often, go find them!

The name of this cache comes from the very creepy cemetery that's about 500ft up the hill from this cache. It's called Douthit Cemetery. Right across for the cache site is an old road that goes up to the cemetery.

You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. It's a very easy cache to find so please cover it back up with the geo-stuff that's on or around it. If you're grabbing this one by boat it's about 3ft from shore.

Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Although not the oldest house standing in Loudon County it's builder, George Bowman, was possibly the first white man to build a permanent home among the Indians in the area.

George Bowman was born in Germany on September 20, 1772 and landed in New York in 1802. The Bowman House was built in 1828. John Bowman had good relations with the nearby Cherokee's in the Indian town of Coytee (see my cache GC1H29A which is very near where Coytee was located). They assisted him in farming and he in turn taught them to make clothing and construct wells and cisterns. Bowman was the first white man to preach the Indians of the settlement. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places.

You seek an ammo can that is hidden at the beginning of what used to be Bowman Rd or Bowman Cemetery Rd (I can't remember which). The house is surrounded by Tellico Village now and is tricky to find. I've posted the coordinates to the house so you can find it on your own. It's privately owned right now. I'll also post the coordinates to the family cemetery which is lost and forgotten amongst the enormous homes in the area.

Most of the description came from the beautiful book &quot;Landmarks of Loudon County&quot; by Joe Spence.

Coordinates for the actual house = N 35° 42.897 W 084° 15.231</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. It's a very easy cache to find so please cover it back up with the geo-stuff that's on or around it. If you're grabbing this one by boat it's about 5ft from shore.

Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.

My wife has Cherokee Indian in her but I don't. If I were an Indian, I would have probably called this tree Grandfather Tree. This tree is massive for this area. Watch for the evil three leafed goblins near this cache.

Don't let the difficulty and terrain rating scare you away from this one. This is a cache that takes special equipment that's why the diff/ter is so high. The first thing you need is darkness (preferably night but solar eclipses may work as well) and a good LED flashlight. You will be taking an easy 3 mile round trip hike in the woods next to the lake.

The above coordinates will take you to the trailhead. There's a ton of parking next to the trailhead. Once you start down the trail, you will be looking for 3-D Stealth Fire Tacks to guide you to the cache. If you don't know what a 3-D Stealth Fire Tack is you can look at the background of this cache page.

Another reason for the difficulty rating is that this area is open to hunting in the Winter so hunters have placed some reflective tacks as well but these are small round white ones, not the 3-D Stealth Tacks you are looking for. They are also only on about the first .2 mile of the trail so once you get past that it's a breeze!

Now for the terrain rating. The hike itself is a 2.5 terrain BUT you will be in the woods at night. These are real woods so there is a chance of encountering wildlife including skunks, racoons, opossum, coyotees, and snakes. Now for the actual cache. You are looking for a large ammo can. Special thanks goes to Destitute for giving us the can. If it wasn't for them, you would've been looking for a lame .30 cal, not a cool MORTAR CAN! Caching at night is extremely fun and this one should be a treat for everyone including kids (as long as you're with your parents!) I've included some very nice trade items. No McJunk here so please trade even!

You will need the hint to find the cache!



If you cache alone or you just don't care to much for the woods at night BUT want to find this cache, email us through our profile and we'll be glad to go out there with you if we're in town.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, there will be no useless trivia, just the facts ma'am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Mount Elbert is the highest point in Colorado as well as the highest point in the Rocky Mountains at 14,440ft above sea level. The mountain was named after Colorado statesman Samuel Hitt Elbert, who was active in the formative period of the State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Mount Frissell.

It would be hard to find someone who isn’t related to someone or at least knows someone who has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Our cheers go out to those who’ve fought and won. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those fighting right now as well as those who’ve lost the battle!&lt;br/&gt;

Kind of a corny name but I really like the series on the History Channel and when I saw the hiding spot I thought of it. When you put 8 caches on a 3 mile trail you run out of names!

You are looking for a .30 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Please cover it back up better than you found it.

Hunting is allowed in the area so it may be a good idea to wear some orange between September 27th - January 18th.

You will need a chirp compatible unit to locate this cache.

You'll be walking along the nature trail in Loudon Municipal Park. This is a great little trail that's about .9 miles long one way and has four caches on it. You will be walking along Sweetwater Creek for much of the trail. During the Summer this is butterfly and dragonfly heaven! Stealth will sometimes be needed but most of the time you will have the trail to yourself.

In the container you will find a small lock&amp;lock with the logbook, stamp, pad, and pen. You will also find a ziplock bag with some swag in it. There are two trailheads, the first is at the shelter to the left as you enter the park. The other is in the back of the park close to the disc golf course.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mrs. Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of the The Hunter In The Däkwä'.

In the old days there was a great fish called the Däkwä', which lived in Tennessee river where Toco creek comes in at Däkwä', the &quot;Däkwä' place,&quot; above the mouth of Tellico, and which was so large that it could easily swallow a man. Once a canoe filled with warriors was crossing over from the town to the other side of the river, when the Däkwä' suddenly rose up under the boat and threw them all into the air. As they came down it swallowed one with a single snap of its jaws and dived with him to the bottom of the river. As soon as the hunter came to his senses he found that he had not been hurt, but it was so hot and close inside the Däkwä' that he was nearly smothered. As he groped around in the dark his hand struck a lot of mussel shells which the fish had swallowed, and taking one of these for a knife he began to cut his way out, until soon the fish grew uneasy at the scraping inside his stomach and came up to the top of the water for air. He kept on cutting until the fish was in such pain that it swam this way and that across the stream and thrashed the water into foam with its tail. Finally the hole was so large that he could look out and saw that the Däkwä' was now resting in shallow water near the shore. Reaching up he climbed out from the side of the fish, moving very carefully so that the Däkwä' would not know it, and then waded to shore and got back to the settlement, but the juices in the stomach of the great fish had scalded all the hair from his head and he was bald ever after.

The cache is on the North Branch trail of the East Lakeshore Trail System. You are looking for a 4x6x2 Lock&amp;Lock. There is a nice place to sit and sign the log and enjoy the view but watch out for the Däkwä'!</groundspeak:long_description>

Lightning McQueen's number from the movie &quot;Cars&quot;.

Find his number and you will find the cache.

***JUST A NOTE***

This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods that don't get found that often, go find them!

Thanks and HAPPY CACHING!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 3 stage multi that has a railroad theme.

The listed coordinates should bring you to a gravel parking lot. Once here, look around for a large dark red object related to the railroad. On the side of this large dark red object is an X followed by 6 numbers. This will be your template to use for finding stage 2.

Call the 6 numbers (from left to right) RSTXYZ.

Now use the following formula to get your stage 2 coordinates: R - 1 = A, S + 4 = B, T - 3 = C, X - 4 = D, Y + 2 = E, and Z - 3 = F

Now just plug in the numbers to this set of coordinates

N35 42.ABC
W084 22.DEF
Check sum is A + B + C = 14, D + E + F = 6

Now you're ready to find stage 2. You don't have to stop to get the required info at stage 2 unless you feel like you need to. There is a small church with parking at the 2nd stage coordinates. When you get close to the coords, slow down and look to your left. You will see another large dark red railroad related item sitting in the middle of a field (private property). There are 6 numbers on the side of this item that will be used to find the final stage.

Again, call the 6 numbers (from left to right) RSTXYZ.
Now use the following formula to get your final coordinates: R + 1 = A, S - 3 = B, T - 2 = C, X - 7 = D, Y - 4 = E, and Z + 6 = F.
Now just plug in the numbers to this set of coordinates
N35 40.ABC
W084 23.DEF
Check sum is A + B + C = 13, D + E + F = 11

You are now ready to find an ammo can at the final set of coordinates. Have fun!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Travel along the back roads and grab this easy p&amp;g along the way. Get it from I-75 and you'll earn a night in the Loudon County Hilton catching up on old times with Bubba ;). He thinks yur purdy.

Bring a pen and a little stealth. Not a busy road but you still need to watch for muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Lesser Known Facts

1) In 1987, this state passed a bill making English the official state language
2) Home to the largest state owned sheep research center in the US
3) Grows more sunflowers than any other state
4) Max G Taubert built a 50ft high pyramid of empty oil cans here. It is believed to be the highest oil can structure in the world

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

Welcome to Friendsville Tennessee. Friendsville was named by the Quakers, who still have a Friends Meetinghouse in the community. Middle Tennessee State University's Center for Historic Preservation has stated that Friendsville, along with nearby Greenback, were stops on the Underground Railroad. This was due in part to the presence of the Quakers, who were leaders in the abolitionist movement. There used to be a cave near the Friendsville meeting house (since filled in) that fugitive slaves were hidden by Quaker William J. Hackney. The cave, which was stocked with provisions, was also used by men who wished to escape to the north to join the Union army.(Info was taken from www.wikipedia.org)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a matchstick container. This is a pretty busy road so stealth will be needed. BYOP!

After a long debate they have decided that this one is okay. I think you will like this micro in the woods. You are looking for a GREEN bison tube. Nothing evil or anything, just a micro in the woods. Remember, GREEN BISON TUBE. There is a pen hidden near the green bison tube but you can BYOP if you want. I even hid some swag very near the green bison tube in the woods. It will be another 26,500 years from now before another micro is hidden in the woods by Team Geologynut so please enjoy.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of The Hunter And Selu.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A hunter had been tramping over the mountains all day long without finding any game and when the sun went down, he built a fire in a hollow stump, swallowed a few mouthfuls of corn gruel and lay down to sleep, tired out and completely discouraged. About the middle of the night he dreamed and seemed to hear the sound of beautiful singing, which continued until near daybreak and then appeared to die away into the upper air.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All next day he hunted with the same poor success, and at night made his lonely camp again, in the woods. He slept and the strange dream came to him again, but so vividly that it seemed to him like an actual happening. Rousing himself before daylight, he still heard the song, and feeling sure now that it was real, he went in the direction of the sound and found that it came from a single green stalk of corn (selu). The plant spoke to him, and told him to cut off some of its roots and take them to his home in the settlement, and the next morning to chew them and &quot;go to water&quot; before anyone else was awake, and then to go out again into the woods, and he would kill many deer and from that time on would always be successful in the hunt. The corn plant continued to talk,
teaching him hunting secrets and telling him always to be generous with the game he took, until it was noon and the sun was high, when it suddenly took the form of a woman and rose gracefully into the air and was gone from sight, leaving the hunter alone in the woods.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He returned home and told his story, and all the people knew that he had seen Selu, the wife of Kana'tï. He did as the spirit had directed, and from that time was noted as the most successful of all the hunters in the settlement.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is on the 2.3 mile Whites Creek Loop Trail in the Whites Creek Small Wildlife Area (TVA)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a decent size round Lock&amp;Lock. I tried hard to get a pen in there but couldn't so BYOP. The cache is only around 400ft from the parking area.&lt;/p&gt;

I gave it a &quot;2&quot; difficulty because its hidden at the base of a pine tree and if you look around, you see a bunch of them. I used a 60CSX and took 400 readings but still only got a 11ft reading so I raised the difficulty. Should still be easy!! You can park really close but use your parking break, trust me.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Water Cannibals.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Besides the friendly Nûñnë'hï of the streams and mountains there is
a race of cannibal spirits, who stay at the bottom of the deep
rivers and live upon human flesh, especially that of little
children. They come out just after daybreak and go about unseen
from house to house until they find some one still asleep, when
they shoot him with their invisible arrows and carry the dead body
down under the water to feast upon it. That no one may know what
has happened they leave in place of the body a shade or image of
the dead man or little child, that wakes up and talks and goes
about just as he did, but there is no life in it, and in seven days
it withers and dies, and the people bury it and think they are
burying their dead friend. It was a long time before the people
found out about this, but now they always try to be awake at
daylight and wake up the children, telling them &quot;The hunters are
among you.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is the way they first knew about the water cannibals: There
was a man in Tïkwäli'tsï town who became sick and grew worse until
the doctors said he could not live, and then his friends went away
from the house and left him alone to die, They were not so kind to
each other in the old times as they are now, because they were
afraid of the witches that came to torment dying people.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He was alone several days, not able to rise from his bed, when one
morning an old woman came in at the door. She looked just like the
other women of the settlement, but he did not know her. She came
over to the bed and said, &quot;You are very sick and your friends seem
to have left you. Come with me and I will make you well.&quot; The man
was so near death that he could not move, but now her words made
him feel stronger at once, and he asked her where she wanted him to
go. &quot;We live close by; come with me and I will show you,&quot; said the
woman, so he got up from his bed and she led the way down to the
water. When she came to the water she stepped in and he followed,
and there was a road under the water, and another country there
just like that above.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
They went on until they came to a settlement with a great many
houses, and women going about their work and children playing. They
met a party of hunters coming in from a hunt, but instead of deer
or bear quarters hanging from their shoulders they carried the
bodies of dead men and children, and several of the bodies the man
knew for those of his own friends in Tïkwäli'tsï. They came to a
house and the woman said &quot;This is where I live,&quot; and took him in
and fixed a bed for him and made him comfortable.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
By this time he was very hungry, but the woman knew his thoughts
and said, &quot;We must get him something to eat. She took one of the
bodies that the hunters had just brought in and cut off a slice to
roast. The man was terribly frightened, but she read his thoughts
again and said, &quot;I see you can not eat our food.&quot; Then she turned
away from him and held her hands before her stomach--so--and when
she turned around again she had them full of bread and beans such
as he used to have at home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So it was every day, until soon he was well and strong again. Then
she told him he might go home now, but he must be sure not to speak
to anyone for seven days, and if any of his friends should question
him he must make signs as if his throat were sore and keep silent.
She went with him along the same trail to the water's edge, and the
water closed over her and he went back alone to Tïkwäli'tsï. When
he came there his friends were surprised, because they thought he
had wandered off and died in the woods. They asked him where he had
been, but he only pointed to his throat and said nothing, so they
thought he was not yet well and let him alone until the seven days
were past, when he began to talk again and told the whole
story.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is on the Hall Bend Trail System on Tellico Lake. You are looking for a flare tube. The Bing map on the cache page shows Hall Ferry Rd right next to the cache. That road has NOT been in existence since the late seventies! I'm a cartographer (GIS Administrator for Loudon County) and this kills me to see such crap on maps these days. The road has been gone for almost 30 years yet our high tech mapping system we depend on still shows it, go figure!  &lt;/p&gt;

The Lesser Known Facts

1) Home to the world’s smallest church (dim 3.5 ft by 6 ft)
2) Toilet paper was invented here in 1857
3) Home to the first state park in the US
4) Home to the oldest cattle ranch in America (1747)

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

Welcome to The Tellico Parkway Series of caches. You seek a screw top container painted to match it's surroundings. You get a lake side view of Tellico Dam from this location. Unless we're on the water, most of us just see the river side of the dam. I thought this was a very nice spot and a nice short walk. I spooked one of the biggest deer I've ever seen while walking to the cache location. Please follow the parking rules that are posted and DON'T BLOCK THE GATE. Enjoy the hunt!!

The Lesser Known Facts

1) The only state with all major natural resources needed to make iron and steel
2) 2,405 feet is the highest point above sea level
3) Admiral David Farragut issued his famous command,”Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead” on 8/5 1864 here

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Welcome to The Tellico Parkway Series of caches. This cache is hidden where the Little Tennessee River and the Tennessee Rivers converge. If you go by boat, the cache is only about 20ft away. We saw about 30 wild turkey, 1 skunk, and 400 piles of deer poop so wildlife is abundant here. GPS signal may be iffy here with a lower level GPS so I provided a hint. I got an 18ft accuracy with 50 readings so you'll get close. Enjoy the hunt!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Welcome to The Tellico Parkway Series of caches. You seek a Rubermaid container painted to match it's surroundings. I would park in the fishing parking lot on the lock side of the dam. This is a really nice walk in the woods. Please put the lid back on right. Enjoy the hunt!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Mrs
Geologynut's great grandmother was full blood Cherokee. We've
always had deep respect for the Cherokee people, their
traditions,stories, and legends. This cache is about the legend of
The Ustû'tlï.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There was once a great serpent called the Ustû'tlï that made its
haunt upon Cohutta mountain. It was called the Ustû'tlï or &quot;foot&quot;
snake, because it did not glide like other snakes, but had feet at
each end of its body, and moved by strides or jerks, like a great
measuring worm. These feet were three-cornered and flat and could
hold on to the ground like suckers. It had no legs, but would raise
itself up on its hind feet, with its snaky head waving high in the
air until it found a good place to take a fresh hold; then it would
bend down and grip its front feet to the ground while it drew its
body up from behind. It could cross rivers and deep ravines by
throwing its head across and getting a grip with its front feet and
then swinging its body over. Wherever its footprints were found
there was danger. It used to bleat like a young fawn, and when the
hunter heard a fawn bleat in the woods he never looked for it, but
hurried away in the other direction. Up the mountain or down,
nothing could escape the Ustû'tlï's pursuit, but along the side of
the ridge it could not go, because the great weight of its swinging
head broke its hold on the ground when it moved sideways.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It came to pass after a while that not a hunter about Cohutta would
venture near the mountain for dread of the Ustû'tlï. At last a man
from one of the northern settlements came down to visit some
relatives in that neighborhood. When he arrived they made a feast
for him, but had only corn and beans, and excused themselves for
having no meat because the hunters were afraid to go into the
mountains. He asked the reason, and when they told him he said he
would go himself to-morrow and either bring in a deer or find the
Ustû'tlï. They tried to dissuade him from it, but as he insisted
upon going they warned him that if he heard a fawn bleat in the
thicket he must run at once and if the snake came after him he must
not try to run down the mountain, but along the side of the
ridge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the morning he started out and went directly toward the
mountain. Working his way through the bushes at the base, he
suddenly heard a fawn bleat in front. He guessed at once that it
was the Ustû'tlï, but he had made up his mind to see it, so he did
not turn back, but went straight forward, and there, sure enough,
was the monster, with its great head in the air, as high as the
pine branches, looking in every direction to discover a deer, or
maybe a man, for breakfast. It saw him and came at him at once,
moving in jerky strides, every one the length of a tree trunk,
holding its scaly head high above the bushes and bleating as it
came.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The hunter was so badly frightened that he lost his wits entirely
and started to run directly up the mountain. The great snake came
after him, gaining half its length on him every time it took a
fresh grip with its fore feet, and would have caught the hunter
before he reached the top of the ridge, but that he suddenly
remembered the warning and changed his course to run along the
sides of the mountain. At once the snake began to lose ground, for
every time it raised itself up the weight of its body threw it out
of a straight line and made it fall a little lower down the side of
the ridge. It tried to recover itself, but now the hunter gained
and kept on until he turned the end of the ridge and left the snake
out of sight. Then he cautiously climbed to the top and looked over
and saw the Ustû'tlï still slowly working its way toward the
summit.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He went down to the base of the mountain, opened his fire pouch,
and set fire to the grass and leaves. Soon the fire ran all around
the mountain and began to climb upward. When the great snake
smelled the smoke and saw the flames coming it forgot all about the
hunter and turned to make all speed for a high cliff near the
summit. It reached the rock and got upon it, but the fire followed
and can ht the dead pines about the base of the cliff until the
heat made the Ustû'tlï's scales crack. Taking a close grip of the
rock with its hind feet it raised its body and put forth all its
strength in an effort to spring across the wall of fire that
surrounded it, but the smoke choked it and its hold loosened and it
fell among the blazing pine trunks and lay there until it was
burned to ashes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is hidden near a small boat launch on the Tennessee
River. You are looking for a sandwich sized Lock&amp;Lock. I can't
remember if I put a pen in it or not but there is a log, I
promise!&lt;/p&gt;

The Lesser Known Facts

1)Sevier County’s County seat is Richfield
2)The State name comes from an Indian word meaning “People of the Mountains”
3)Cervus Canadensis is the State’s official animal

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">WHAT'S IN A NUMBER?

On June 2, 2010, a perfect game was thrown by Armando Galarraga of the Detroit Tigers but the perfect game will never be in the record books because of an extremely bad call by umpire Jim Joyce. After getting 26 straight batters out and needing only one more out, rookie Jason Donald hit a ground ball to first for the final out. Well, we thought it was the final out but umpire Joyce called the runner safe. Replay shows the runner being out by at least a step and a half! 99.9% of us would have yelled and screamed at the umpire but not Galarraga. He scrugged it off, got the next guy out and ended the game, not blaming anybody for what got taken away from him. With all the bad eggs in pro sports today this is one young man that is truly a professional and a role model for all.

Find his number and you will find the cache.

***JUST A NOTE***

This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods that don't get found that often, go find them!

Thanks and HAPPY CACHING!</groundspeak:long_description>

After using it on about 80-somehting caches, I was informed that the ink bleeds off the page when the log got wet. Sooooo, after a lot of checking and rechecking of my gsak info, I left the house with a list in hand to go back and resign those caches.

Every trip out here has been at night but someday I'd like to come back in daylight to enjoy the area as well as more caching. Thanks for placing caches for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

The log is printed on water resistant paper so a fine tip Sharpie is best here. Ball points may work but remember, to claim the find your name better be on the log! You may also want to bring some hand sanitizer (he he he)!</groundspeak:long_description>

In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on the log.


The Lesser Known Facts

1) This state takes its name from a Spanish word meaning “snow-clad”

2)This state has more hotel rooms than any other place on Earth

3) Home to the Kangaroo Rat which can live its entire life without drinking a drop of liquid

4)The ichthyosaur is the official state fossil



Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

The cave goes back several hundred feet but unless you're experienced, I would not recommend exploring it. This cave is located right next to the road and there is a very small area to park. You seek a Lock&amp;Lock container.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mr. Bojangles was a country tune originally written and performed by Jerry Walker in 1968. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band covered it in 1971 and it rose to #9 on the Billboard pop chart.



&quot;I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt, and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high, jumped so high
Then he lightly touched down&quot;




We moved this one. The old hiding spot was just to high maintenance. You are looking for a magnetic keyholder. Leaving the difficulty as is so it doesn't screw up peoples grid although now it's a 1.5!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Welcome to The
Appalachian Quilt Trail. This is the Loudon County segment of the
trail. This segment is so new the brochure isn't out yet! When I
get more details on these quilt squares I will update the cache
page.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The square you see here is the Mariners Compass. This is located at
the Loudon County Welcome Center on Hwy 321 North or should I say,
&quot;The Lakeway to the Smokies&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You seek an ammo can full of goodies. Management and employees of
the visitor center know about the cache and look forward to
watching you find the cache. The visitors center is open Mon-Sat
from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. If you find the cache during those hours,
please go inside and say hi. You may thank them for being cacher
friendly and also sign their guest book.</groundspeak:long_description>

This was our last stop before home and it was dark and on a Sunday night so we didn't get to drop in and talk to the good folks there; though, we have visited there before we got into caching. Took one of the flyers and briefly checked out the &quot;alternative/additional&quot; option and may see you there. (Team Geologynut, if you didn't place the fliers there and don't know what I'm talking about, feel free to email me about them.)

Welcome to the &quot;America The Beautiful&quot; series of quarters showing off our national treasures. The first quarter and cache in this series is Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Hot Springs National Park was established on 4/20/1832 during Andrew Jackson's presidency. For more info on Hot Springs National Park check out this webpage http://www.nps.gov/hosp/index.htm.

This is a park, jump across a creek, do some minor bouldering, and grab a cache. Pretty Little Monster, who is 4 yrs old, helped me place this cache with little help! You seek a Lock&amp;Lock container. Cache is probably 200 ft from the parking area. Good luck and be careful!</groundspeak:long_description>

In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on the logsheet.

The Lesser Known Facts

1) Accounts for 25% of the oil produced in the US

2) Has a coastline that extends over 6,600 miles


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

New container is about the same size as a 35mm film canister with only a log. BYOP. Included a Team Semper Questio '08 pathtag for anyone that collects such. PLEASE conceal well as there can be extensive muggle traffic around the cache.

This is a nice little public park. It has a playground for children, and a walking area. There is also a nice view of sailboats at Concord Yacht Club, across the water. The cache will require some stealth due to people walking around all the time. </groundspeak:long_description>

The Lesser Known Facts

1) Home of the first subway system in the US
2) The first basketball game was played here in 1891
3) The birth control pill was invented here
4) The sewing machine was invented here



Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

The mini league is playing baseball. These are the smallest baseball players ever! I am guessing they are under 3 years of age. They can hardly walk, let alone run. Great to watch (the parents...)

Cache found quickly; at 30ft off GZ coordinates.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Knox County Appalachian Quilt Trail is part of a larger quilt trail stretching through the Appalachian region made up of outdoor replications of quilt blocks on outbuildings. The purpose of the Appalachian Quilt Trail is to stimulate economic development through tourism in rural areas and increase sales of local arts., produce, value added products, accommodations and amenities. The project is being coordinated by Rural Conservation and Development Districts throughout the Appalachian region, supported by groups such as the East Tennessee Foundation and Knox County Parks and Recreation.

Knox County is part of the Smoky Mountain Resource Conservation and Development Council and is developing four loops starting in downtown Knoxville that circle out to the rural areas to cross one of the four major rivers that flow through Knox County; the French Broad, the Holston, the Clinch, and the Tennessee River.

This quilt block is in honor of Carl A Cowan. Attorney, volunteer, community activist, Carl Cowan was known as a pioneer for his efforts in encouraging church, civic and professional groups to join together to peacefully integrate Knox County. Carl Cowan was successful in initiating new services for minority Knox County citizens including this park, which is named in his honor.(info was taken from monument)

Now, to find this easy 2 stage multi, at the listed coords, find his age at death. Be careful because on one side of the monument you find a way of determining his age but on the other side of the monument you find a more detailed way of determining his age at death. Call this 2 digit number XY. Now fill in the blanks-

N35 51.0XY
W084 05.598

The final stage is an ammo can in the woods. Stealth will be needed most of the time.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the state quarter series. I’ll be hiding 50 caches, one for each state quarter. In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on top of the logsheet.


The Lesser Known Facts

1) The first woman mayor was elected here in 1887
2) The geographical center of the 48 contiguous states is here
3) There are 27 Walnut Creeks in the state
4) This state has the largest population of wild grouse in North America
5) Home to the American Institute of Baking


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

You are looking for an ammo can. Please park near or at the provided parking coordinates and be very very careful crossing the road. I don't know how kid friendly this one is. My son who is 13 came with me to hide this and had no problems but he is used to this terrain (Update 8/4/11 my 7 yr old daughter made it as well but she's not your typical Barbie playing girl either). There are about a 1000 places to break your ankle, alot of rock hopping, sheer drops, and slippery slopes to deal with. You can make this anywhere from a 3 terrain to a 5+ terrain. The cache IS &lt;b&gt;NOT DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT.&lt;/b&gt; Coords were taken with a 6ft accuracy with 400 readings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

There is a reason that this cache is a 4 1/2 difficulty so don't look for 5 minutes and assume the cache is not there. It took us about 8 minutes to get from car to cache. Have fun and be very careful!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The Lesser Known Facts

1) The first successful parachute jump made from a moving plane was made here in 1912
2) Iced tea was invented here in 1904
3) The ice cream cone was invented here in 1904 as well
4) The first state to free it’s slaves


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

Welcome to the Tennessee Jukebox. Tennessee is known for it's country singers but this state has produced some Grammy winning artists in other genres as well. To solve this puzzle cache, I'll introduce you to some famous Tennesseans and you'll do a little research to figure the coordinates out.

The coordinates are 35 5A.BCD 084 1E.FGH

Justin Timberlake (genre: pop, r&amp;b) was born in Memphis, TN on A/31/1981
Gregg Allman (genre: rock, southern rock) was born in Nashville, TN on 12/8/194B
Josey Scott (Saliva)(genre: metal) was born in Memphis, TN on 5/3/19C2
Lester Flatt (genre: bluegrass) was born in Duncan's Chapel, TN on 6/D9/1914
Aretha Franklin (genre: pop, r&amp;b) was born in Memphis, TN on E/25/1942
Issac Hayes (genre: r&amp;b) was born in Covington, TN on 9/2F/1942)
Tina Turner (genre: pop, r&amp;b) was born in Nutbush, TN on 1G/26/1939
Kenny Chesney (genre: country) was born in Knoxville, TN on 3/2H/1968

Once you figure out this easy puzzle, you'll be on your way to finding a .30 cal ammo can with some new and used cd's in it. There are two ways to find this cache, (1) You can park in a large, well lit parking lot with a short walk on fairly level terrain or (2) You can park on the side of a major highway, bushwack through some thick woods while cussing me the whole time, your choice!</groundspeak:long_description>

Took Barenaked Ladies cd (one of the few we don't have) and left one of our favorites -- Lyle Lovett's Joshua, Judges, Ruth to try to introduce someone else to his wonderful songs and sound. Adding this one to our favorites. TFTC!

The cache is hidden at the place where George Watson had his country grocery store for many years.
When I was growing up, sometimes we would walk from the Jct. to here to buy candy. You can still see the block wall where the porch was. We used to sit out on that porch and watch the cars go by.

George and Eula Watson lived in the back of the store. You can still see the concrete foundation of their living quarters.

I can't remember if they died and the property was sold or if they just sold it and moved when they got older. It later became a TV repair shop, then sat empty for many years.

The DOT came in and took the property for right-of-way and now all you see is the old foundation.

Good luck and be stealthy.</groundspeak:long_description>

The place you are visiting used to be the Watt property. If you look down toward the creek, you will still see the bridge the Watt family used to cross to get to their house. It doesn't look like much now, but it was strong strong enough to hold cars and trucks when the family lived here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When it snowed, we would come here to sled down the hill. The hill was straight then. No retention pond was there. In fact, where the retention pond is now is exactly where the Watt house once stood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

As with most of the area, urban sprawl is taking over and the families who lived here are selling out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This was find number 25 of 38 caches I found this weekend.  This was by far my most favorite cache of the Geoquest.  It combined a lot of my favorites all in one.  It's an Ammo can cache, there is telephone stuff here, there's a nice water feature here, and something historical.  What a great cache placement!  One of our team members looked in the spot and missed the cache. Then, a few minutes later, I was being nosy and spotted the cache!  Thanks for the fun!  </groundspeak:text>

When our Labrador was little he became affectionately known by our family as &quot;Poopie Puppy&quot;. Since then, we've just sort of called all dogs poopies instead of puppies.

In the middle of a West Knoxville neighborhood is a large grassy area where many of the residents walk their dogs and is now known to us as &quot;Poopie Park&quot;. That being said, watch your step while going after this one.

You're looking for an 8 oz., cammoed lock-n-lock. Has room for small trade items and contained a handheld casino game for the first to find, which was then replaced w/ some small swag items.

You can park on a pretty quiet side street very near the coordinates. Embankment may be slippery after rain. Dog walkers and children playing could cause the need for stealth at times. Enjoy and happy hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

We're not big fans of Elton John but his song &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; is a pretty good one.



&quot;The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side,
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die.

It doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey,
If I don't change the pace,
I can't face another day.

And love lies bleeding in my hand,
It kills me to think of you with another man.
I was playing rock-n-roll and you were just a fan,
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band.
Love lies bleeding in my hands.

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you,
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through.

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now,
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow.&quot;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in a Knoxville Park, 0.7 miles from the parking area. The cache is a regular size ammo box. As the name implies, the cache is located just off trail near a Mtn. Bike technical section of trail. 


The cache is hidden in an area of the Park that has an abundance of trails that wonder over wooded hills with some near Ft. Loudon Lake. Mountain Bikers as well as hikers use these trails and can be quite active in the warmer months.
The parking area and trailhead sign are near these coordinances:
35 51.852 N
084 07.572 W
Just inside the gate at the trailhead is a nice map of the Sinking Creek Trail system.
This is typical East Tennessee woods, so wear the proper clothes and shoes for the occasion, it can be a little muddy.
It’s a short walk if you arrive by boat…..hint hint.

The Lesser Known Facts

1) Kool-Aid was invented here
2) Birthplace of the Reuben sandwich
3) The E911 system was developed and first used here
4) Home to the worlds largest hand-planted forest

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

I've been here three times and each time a cute little dog has met me at the bottom of the hill and climbed to the top with me. Yes I said hill. Hope it hasn't rained recently if you're planning to grab this one. Might be fun though to watch! You are looking for an ammo can. Stealth may be needed. Do not attempt this one at night. The old bridge across the water has holes in it and you may not see them at night. Perfectly safe during daylight!</groundspeak:long_description>

There shouldn't be very many muggles around but you may need to use stealth as cars pass by. Please use both sides of the log and just date and initial it. This cache is in plain site and can be seen when you pull up next to it. Experienced cachers should have no problem. Please place it back where you took it because it looks like it belongs where I have it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No this isn't Humphreys Peak. It's a new series of caches exploring America's highest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 

Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, there will be no useless trivia, just the facts ma'am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 

Humphreys Peak is the highest point in Arizona at 12,637 ft above sea level. It is located within the Kachina Peaks Wilderness in the Coconino National Forest, about 11 miles north of Flagstaff, Arizona. Humphreys Peak is the highest of a group of extinct volcanic peaks known as the San Francisco Peaks. The summit can be most easily reached by hiking the 4.8 miles long Humphreys Trail that begins at the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort in the Coconino National Forest. The last 1 mile of the trail traverses the only region of tundra in Arizona, at an elevation of more than 11,500 feet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Humphreys Peak was named in about 1870 for General Andrew A. Humphreys, a U.S. Army officer who was a Union general during the American Civil War, and who later became Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, a General Land Office map from 1903 showed the name San Francisco Peak applied to this feature (apparently borrowed from San Francisco Mountain on which the peak stands). Thus the United States Board on Geographic Names approved the variant name in 1911. In 1933, the application of the names was rectified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Mount Magazine.

Take a short hike on this trail to find a large (5 gallon water cooler) cache camo painted and chained to a tree. This cache has some nice items in it to start so please trade up or at least trade even. Starting items include;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

an almost new rollerball mouse for laptop several 8x10 NASCAR driver photos a PS2 game a label maker (no batteries or label) a Smokies starter kit (maps and info) lots of software for PC and a whole lot more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is chained to a tree so if you uncover the BRIGHT YELLOW lock, please cover it back up. Stealth shouldn't be to much of an issue but use your head. There are two parking areas for this trail. For this cache, the upper parking is closest.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is a 3 1/2 by 3 1/2 square, tupperware container hidden next to a cool cave. A lot of people come to Melton Hill and never know this little gem is here. You don't have to go into the cave to get this cache. Right now the cave is flooded but I have been in it before when it was dry. The 3.5 terrain rating is because unless you're over 7 feet tall, you'll have to do a little rock climbing. No special equipment needed just be careful. You will also cross a slippery, dry creek bed.

You are looking for a 1.5 quart rubbermaid container with a locking top. Container is waterproof and airtight if the top is put back on correctly (hint hint).  There is a log and pen. There's a lot of tree cover so the best read I could get was with 25' accuracy so I will tell you that it's on the left side of the trail about 20 or so feet off trail. No need to do any bushwacking, just wait till you find somewhat of a clearing. If I tell you anymore I might as well be holding your hand!!

The Lesser Known Facts

You are looking for a 1.9 quart Rubbermaid container with a locking top. Container is waterproof and airtight if the top is put back on right (hint,hint). I rated it a difficulty rating of 2 because there are a lot of places where this could be hidden. Coordinates are great but you'll still have to search a little. There is an Envelope marked FTF. The FTF can take this envelope which contains a $5 Wal-Mart card and an unactivated Travel Bug set. Besides the FTF envelope, starting contents are; glow stick, Eeyore toy, Tigger toy, Purina Beggin Chew for your best friend, and Mr. Germania Travel Bug. I walk this park everyday after work. If you get there before 5:00 PM you'll have the park to yourself most of the time. If you come after 5:00 PM the place is sometimes packed!! The trail that this is on opens at 8:30AM and closes at dusk (So the sign says!). Stealth may be needed!

Nice walk. Great hint... ahum. Had to sit down for a minute to let a couple of mugles pass by, and saw it from the sitting position. GZ was &quot; a bit&quot; off.

This was find number 22 of 38 caches I found this weekend.  Since I'm the resident gun expert, I was sent out along with BlessedbyGod to go find this cache.  I stopped for a minute and talked guns with the shooter while BBG ran off ahead of me.  Nice Chinese rifle he was shooting.  So, I headed off to go find the cache... and headed UP the hill... finally made it to top where we found the cache and the easier way out.  Lots of thorns on the easier way out though.  As soon as we got back in the car, another GeoQuest team pulled up!  Thanks for the fun!  </groundspeak:text>

A couple of years ago, I bought her a new minivan because of our expanding family. After I bought it for her I started making fun of her calling her soccer mom. She hated that! She is no soccer mom, just a good ole country girl. I felt this location fit her first cache placement. You'll understand the title when you get here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The Lesser Known Facts
1) Home to the world famous Mashed Potato Wrestling contest
2) The battleship named after this state was the most decorated battleship during WWII
3) Tom Brokaw graduated high school here


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

You are looking for a micro pretty much the same as a bison.



YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISASSEMBLE ANYTHING, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TEAR THROUGH THE LANDSCAPING, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE ANY STONES OR ROCKS. IN OTHER WORDS DON'T TEAR THE PLACE UP!!

The Lesser Known Facts

1) Leads the nation in copper production

2) Blue and gold are the official state colors

3) Home to a fountain believed to be the tallest in the world

4)Home to architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s studio built in 1939



Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

The Piano Man by Billy Joel. In my younger days I spent many a night with far too many in me singing this song (badly out of tune) with several other intoxicated friends. This song has to be one of the best sing along songs out there!


&quot;Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, &quot;Bill, I believe this is killing me.&quot;
As the smile ran away from his face
&quot;Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place&quot;

This is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the South Pacific Ocean. The main (largest and most populous) island is Tutuila, with the Manu?a Islands, Rose Atoll, and Swains Island also included in the territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

A couple of quick, interesting facts is that about 30 people from here (whether born here or having family from here) play in the NFL. My favorite NFL player Troy Polamalu, though born in the US has these people's blood in his veins. Many pro wrestlers come from here too! The zipcode here is 96799.

After using it on about 80-somehting caches, I was informed that the ink bleeds off the page when the log got wet. Sooooo, after a lot of checking and rechecking of my gsak info, I left the house with a list in hand to go back and resign those caches.

Every trip out here has been at night but someday I'd like to come back in daylight to enjoy the area as well as more caching. Thanks for placing caches for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question. The title also may be a clue. When you find the cache, there will be a picture of the state quarter on the log.


The Lesser Known Facts

1) This state was the first to list their website URL on a license plate

2) Home of the first zoological garden in July 1874

3) Home to the longest stone arch bridge in the world

4) The first Little League World Series was held here in 1946

Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the state quarter series. I’ll be hiding 50 caches, one for each state quarter. In the cache description below, you will find some hopefully lesser known facts about the state in question.
The title also may be a clue.


The Lesser Known Facts

1) 63% of this state is public land managed by the federal government
2) 85% of all the commercial trout sold in the US came from here
3) Home to the largest private two year college in the nation
4) Has a state law that prohibits a citizen to give another citizen a box of candy weighing more than 50 pounds


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

Welcome to the &quot;America The Beautiful&quot; series of quarters showing off our national treasures. The fourth quarter and cache in this series is Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Grand Canyon National Park was established on 2/20/1893 during Benjamin Harrison's presidency. For more info on Grand Canyon National Park check out this webpage http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Please respect times of worship and go find another one if services are going on.

You are looking for a Lock&amp;Lock container. The cache hiding spot isn't very good but the purpose of this cache is to take you very near a magnificant tree. The cache is about 10ft away from a RECORD Hackberry Tree. I don't know if it's a World record or State record, the sign doesn't say. The sign does say &lt;b&gt;DO NOT DISTURB&lt;/b&gt; and I'm also telling you to &lt;b&gt;DO NOT DISTURB&lt;/b&gt; this tree. View it, admire it, take a picture of it, but &lt;b&gt;DO NOT TOUCH OR DISTURB IT!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

To find the coordinates, just find the 6 caches on this greenway. Look in the lid of each ammo can and you will find a number. You are looking for the number that is surrounded by a square. Plug the numbers into this;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The Lesser Known Facts

1) More turkeys are raised here than in any other state
2) This state has a law on the books establishing a $500 fine for molesting butterflies
3) Home to the Raisin Capital of the world
4) I was born here


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

This park looks like it has everything. Tons of picnic tables, a swimming area with bath house, boat ramp, covered pavilions, lots of fishing spots, lots of places for sports, and lots of trails!! You are looking for an ammo can located about 40ft off the greenway trail. You will have to cross a small creek but it's not that difficult at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

There are 2 different places to park for the caches on the greenway, 1 for Summer and 1 for Winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Summer Parking = N 35° 57.448 W 084° 14.929&lt;br/&gt;

The Lesser Known Facts

1) The car theft capital of the world
2) The largest chemical producing state in the nation
3) Home to the tallest water tower in the world
4) This state has a spoon museum featuring over 5,400 spoons from every state and almost every country


Don’t worry, if you don’t figure out the trivia, just look on the logsheet.

Find all 50 and you qualify for the State Quarter Series - The Final Cache

I'll let you decide which route to take. You are looking for a Lock&amp;Lock in the shadow of a really cool geological formation, Big Foot's Bunion. Please cover it back up better than you found it and enjoy this wonderful place!</groundspeak:long_description>

2) The only state that still refers to the Napoleonic Code in it’s state law
3) In this state, biting someone with your natural teeth is considered a simple assault, but biting someone with your false teeth is considered an aggravated assault

This is a micro so BYOP. If you have found one of these cache containers it will be a simple find. If there is a game going on, good luck!! There are park hours on the entrance sign so please observe them. I think it's 7:00 AM to 9:30 PM. The cache is not in the ball field.

Not too tough of a hide but you will need something to extract the log with. The cache itself is bigger than a nano but smaller than a bison tube. Parking is across the road. Be VERY careful when crossing the road!

&lt;br/&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these

would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

Simple &lt;b&gt;Park and Grab&lt;/b&gt;. You’re looking for a micro
container with log only.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
My inspiration for this series is rooted in the yard sale my wife
drags me to every year along this same stretch of Hwy 127.
“Worlds Longest Yard Sale” they claim, running 675
miles from Michigan to Alabama along route 127.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So I thought to myself as I’m yard-sailing along,
“Wouldn’t it be great if there were as many caches as
there were yard sale stops along the way… that would
certainly make it more worthwhile.” “And what if these
caches extended from the beginning of Hwy 127 to the end, that
would be 675 miles of caches!!!”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So get out there, enjoy the caches I have placed, but please bring
along a bucket of caches to add to the &lt;b&gt;POWER TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; while you
are out there. Head North, Head South, any State along HWY 127 will
count.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A great
place to watch&lt;br/&gt;
 the 'big boats' go through the locks or just have a picnic on the
beautiful Ohio&lt;br/&gt;
 River. You are looking of a 35mm camo'd container beside the
parking lot with a&lt;br/&gt;
 log only. So bring your own writing utensil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy the

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our favorite place to come
have some fun. They have great concerts on the weekends and the
food in nice also. If you are in a gaming mode, they will help you
there also with the casino riverboat with all the games and
slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo'd
waterproof match container in the front park. It is well hid in the
hedge behind a bench. So be stealthily while going after this one.
A 2.5 because of the placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the casino and
cache..........'Rubicon' Wooly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE.....Follow your GPS'r and
then the hint you will be fine. Belterra knows the cache is there,
but if mess too much in the bushes, they will visit
you............


Have Fun...both at the casino and caching!&lt;/p&gt;

 I decided to try my hand at mountain biking – and why not drop some caches on the way….


The cache is located on the East Fork Lake South Trail.  Per their website the trail is 2.3 miles long with 70% single track (mountain bike speak) with 58 feet of elevation change.  They rate it as easy and I would tend to agree.  When I rode it the trail was bone dry, but I’ve read online warnings about how bad the trail can be for bikes when even slightly wet.  You can, of course, hike on this trial as well.  Parking for all 3 mountain bike trails is available at:  N39 00.408 W84 08.526.  With the tree cover I’ll tend to give extensive hints to guide you to the cache.

 Near the cache is a &quot;bridge&quot; to get over a damp drainage area.  Fortunately for me is was bone dry the day I was here and went around.  This mountain biking is a whole new mindset....

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

 A few things I learned on my first mountain biking trip.

1) Keep the pedals even - not one down.
2) Put the water bottle somewhere it'll stay clean
3) Don't hit the brakes too hard!

The cache is located on the East Fork Lake South Trail.  Per their website the trail is 2.3 miles long with 70% single track (mountain bike speak) with 58 feet of elevation change.

 The north trail is the most technical and advanced of the three mount bike trails at East Fork Lake. It is ride-able for most but the beginner may find themselves walking a few areas. This section of trail is ~2.5 miles. There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.  Compared to the other 2 tails the margin for error is less and the consequences greater (steep hills!)

There is parking at both ends  

N39 00.408 W84 08.526
N 39 0.859, W 84 8.304

You can also ride you bike between the two parking places via roads as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The cache is located on the East Fork Lake Middle Trail.  Per their website the trail is 2.9 miles long with 100% single track (mountain bike speak) with 70 feet of elevation change.  They rate it as intermediate and I would say it isn’t much more difficult than the “easy” South trail.  When I rode it the trail was bone dry, but I’ve read online warnings about how bad the trail can be for bikes when even slightly wet.  You can, of course, hike on this trial as well.

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

More trail details and a downloaded gpx “track” available at:

http://www.mtbguru.com/trip/show/15377-north-trail-east-fork-lake-ohio-state-park 

 The north trail is the most technical and advanced of the three mount bike trails at East Fork Lake. It is ride-able for most but the beginner may find themselves walking a few areas. This section of trail is ~2.5 miles. There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.  Compared to the other 2 tails the margin for error is less and the consequences greater (steep hills!)

There is parking at both ends  

N39 00.408 W84 08.526
N 39 0.859, W 84 8.304

You can also ride you bike between the two parking places via roads as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The cache is located on the East Fork Lake Middle Trail.  Per their website the trail is 2.9 miles long with 100% single track (mountain bike speak) with 70 feet of elevation change.  They rate it as intermediate and I would say it isn’t much more difficult than the “easy” South trail.  When I rode it the trail was bone dry, but I’ve read online warnings about how bad the trail can be for bikes when even slightly wet.  You can, of course, hike on this trial as well.  Parking for all 3 mountain bike trails is available at:  N39 00.408 W84 08.526.  With the tree cover I’ll tend to give extensive hints to guide you to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

 The north trail is the most technical and advanced of the three mount bike trails at East Fork Lake. It is ride-able for most but the beginner may find themselves walking a few areas. This section of trail is ~2.5 miles. There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.  Compared to the other 2 tails the margin for error is less and the consequences greater (steep hills!)

There is parking at both ends  

N39 00.408 W84 08.526
N 39 0.859, W 84 8.304

You can also ride you bike between the two parking places via roads as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am “disabling” to point out I hope to upgrade (larger containers – by popular demand!) some of the caches on the South and Middle East Fork Mountain bike trails.  My plan is to do this on Sunday Sept. 26th  early in the morning.

To UP the size of some of these caches will require relocating some of them.  If you go to find these before I have had a chance to post the new cords – here’s some hints to where the look:

-	I doubt I’ll move more than 25’-50’ tops.  Spacing between caches will become and issue beyond that.  That being said it’s a good guess I’ll have to relocate towards the outside of the trail loop and not the inside.
-	The cache size will be larger than whatever is listed on the webpage.  There probably won’t be TOO many places to hide a cache that is small or regular within that distance.
-	I hate briars and bushwacking.  Any relocated caches will be a reasonable deviation off the trail.
-	NOTE:  I probably won’t/can’t up the size and relocate all the caches.  Some will be right where this webpage says it is….

 The north trail is the most technical and advanced of the three mount bike trails at East Fork Lake. It is ride-able for most but the beginner may find themselves walking a few areas. This section of trail is ~2.5 miles. There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.  Compared to the other 2 tails the margin for error is less and the consequences greater (steep hills!)

There is parking at both ends  

N39 00.408 W84 08.526
N 39 0.859, W 84 8.304

You can also ride you bike between the two parking places via roads as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

http://www.mtbguru.com/trip/show/15376-middle-trail-east-fork-lake-ohio-state-park 

 The cache is located on the East Fork Lake Middle Trail.  Per their website the trail is 2.9 miles long with 100% single track (mountain bike speak) with 70 feet of elevation change.  They rate it as intermediate and I would say it isn’t much more difficult than the “easy” South trail.  When I rode it the trail was bone dry, but I’ve read online warnings about how bad the trail can be for bikes when even slightly wet.  You can, of course, hike on this trial as well.  

Parking for all 3 mountain bike trails is available at:  N39 00.408 W84 08.526.  With the tree cover I’ll tend to give extensive hints to guide you to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

More trail details and a downloaded gpx “track” available at:

http://www.mtbguru.com/trip/show/15377-north-trail-east-fork-lake-ohio-state-park 

 The north trail is the most technical and advanced of the three mount bike trails at East Fork Lake. It is ride-able for most but the beginner may find themselves walking a few areas. This section of trail is ~2.5 miles. There is more climbing than the other two trails combined and a dry creek bed crossing made of flat rock. This trail flows as well as the middle loop but has many more roots, climbs, and rocks to challenge even the best riders.  Compared to the other 2 tails the margin for error is less and the consequences greater (steep hills!)

There is parking at both ends  

N39 00.408 W84 08.526
N 39 0.859, W 84 8.304

You can also ride you bike between the two parking places via roads as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The cache is located on the East Fork Lake Middle Trail.  Per their website the trail is 2.9 miles long with 100% single track (mountain bike speak) with 70 feet of elevation change.  They rate it as intermediate and I would say it isn’t much more difficult than the “easy” South trail.  When I rode it the trail was bone dry, but I’ve read online warnings about how bad the trail can be for bikes when even slightly wet.  You can, of course, hike on this trial as well.  Parking for all 3 mountain bike trails is available at:  N39 00.408 W84 08.526.  With the tree cover I’ll tend to give extensive hints to guide you to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

 I noticed this bike trail on the map and saw no caches :-(

It took some doing since the CRC who manages this area didn't have a geocaching policy/permitting system. They do now!  Even though this is the only sizable property they manage (mostly ball fields etc) they put together a permitting system - just for us.

Needless to say, I'll put more than a few along the trail to make it worth everyone's time.

 I, like a million other kids, wanted to grow up to be an Air Force pilot.  Well, at least I'm still in the aviation business. Still love airplanes and its great just to be around an airport like this.  Have a seat, take in the view, and maybe think about what you wanted to be when you grow up!  (I geocacher perhaps? :-)

 I think geocaching by bike is the most enjoyable method.  You get to see more scenery faster and cover move distance. While you can walk on the trail - it's a PNG for a biker.

&lt;b&gt;Confluence of
the Ohio and Licking Rivers&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The posted
coordinates will take you to an overlook at General James Taylor
Park at Newport, Kentucky (image above). There before you is the
confluence of the Licking and Ohio
rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

______________________________________________________

&lt;br/&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;confluence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the Licking and Ohio Rivers
as viewed from the 4th Street bridge pedway in Newport,KY.
&lt;br/&gt;

______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What is a &lt;b&gt;CONFLUENCE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Confluence&lt;/b&gt;, in geography, describes &lt;i&gt;the meeting of two or
more bodies of water.&lt;/i&gt; It usually refers to the point where a
tributary joins a more major river, called the mainstem, when that
major river is also the highest order stream in the drainage
basin.
&lt;br/&gt;

______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Licking River&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Licking River&lt;/b&gt; is a tributary of the Ohio River,
approximately 320 mi long in northeastern Kentucky in the United
States. The river and its tributaries drain much of the region of
northeastern Kentucky between the watersheds of the Kentucky River
to the west and the Big Sandy River to the east. The Licking River
rises in the Cumberland Plateau of eastern Kentucky, in
southeastern Magoffin County. It flows northwest in a highly
meandering course past Salyersville and West Liberty. In Rowan
County in the Daniel Boone National Forest it is impounded to form
the large Cave Run Lake reservoir. Northwest of the reservoir it
receives Fleming Creek approximately 8 mi northwest of Carlisle and
flows across the Bluegrass region of northern Kentucky. It receives
the North Fork from the east approximately 10 mi northwest of Mount
Olivet and the South Fork from the south at Falmouth. It joins the
Ohio opposite Cincinnati, Ohio, where it separates the cities of
Covington and Newport.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ohio River&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Ohio River&lt;/b&gt; is the largest tributary by volume of the
Mississippi River. It is approximately 981 miles long and is
located in the eastern United States. The river had great
significance in the history of the Native Americans. It was a
primary transportation route during the westward expansion of the
early U.S. It flows through or along the border of six states, and
its watershed encompasses 14 states, including many of the states
of the southeastern U.S.&lt;br/&gt;
The Ohio River is young from a geologic standpoint. The river
formed on a piecemeal basis beginning between 2.5 and 3 million
years ago. The earliest Ice Ages occurred at this time and dammed
portions of north flowing rivers. The Teays River was the largest
of these rivers, and the modern Ohio River flows within segments of
the ancient Teays. The ancient rivers were rearranged or consumed
by glaciers and lakes.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To log this earthcache, take a photo of yourself &lt;i&gt;or your
GPSr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at the posted coordinates on the Newport Riverwalk
overlook with the confluence in the background (my photo above
right was washed out by glare, but the confluence is out
there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;________________________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And, to demonstrate the educational value of the
Earthcache,email the answers to these three questions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. What is the larger of the two streams of a confluence
called?&lt;br/&gt;
2. Determine &lt;i&gt;FLOW RATES&lt;/i&gt; for the two rivers in feet per
second (FPS). This may be accomplished by measuring a distance
along each of the river banks, floating an object from your
starting point to the ending point, and recording the time it takes
the object to float the distance. Once the &lt;i&gt;distance&lt;/i&gt;
and&lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; are determined, calculate the FPS for each waterway.
You may be surprised. &lt;b&gt;If there is no current just say so and
pass on this exercise.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
3. At the base of the &lt;b&gt;From Newport&lt;/b&gt; ironwork is an inscribed
tile in the walkway (above center) which reads, &lt;b&gt;'The valleys,
plains and salt licks of Kentucky have attracted human settlement
for at least&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;blank&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;years&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;How many?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Greetings from nj

Came back this morning to collect addition information and to take better pictures.  Second day of adventuree starts on the NJ-PA-OH-KY-OH-IN-IL-WI trip.

I enjoyed this earthcache and enjoyed thinking about the answers.


This place is a lot quieter in the morning!

 Biking around the Lunken trail there's plenty to look at: modern aircraft in operation, the flat plain of the field before the surrounding hills, - even a glimpse of the Little Miami and Ohio rivers when the leaves are down.

Near this spot if you look there's an F86 Sabre jet being refurbished (I hope).  Beautiful craft and one of the most lethal in its day.

Enjoy the views.

&lt;p&gt;One of the best

of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include restrooms,
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail itself
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance you
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the GPX

Please replace the cache exactly where you found it (about 1' off the ground in a cubby hole - if that's NOT where you found it!  :-)  It's a bit of a hike from the parking (so bring the dog), but you can use a bike on the path. 

 This cache is in tribute to the newest member of our family - Duke.  He's a miniture poodle we got from the Sharonville SPCA.  This is the first dog any of us has every owned and now I know what they mean when people write that their dog was their &quot;constant companion&quot;!  He is a &quot;people&quot; dog and will follow you anywhere (better close that bathroom door!)  He's a great dog and we were very lucky to find him at the shelter.  Only only bad habit he has is trying to sneak outside to have at the chipmunks and squirrels in the neghborhood.

This is his favorite park because of the dog park here.

If you are interested in adopting a dog or cat - you can contact me and I can ask my daughter to keep and eye out for any particular breed - she volunteers at the SPCA.</groundspeak:long_description>

lane of Central Parkway (except 4-6 weekdays). It is very near the
cache. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true! Cincinnati started building a subway in the 1920’s
but abandoned the concept shortly afterwards. Mostly what is left
are the tunnels. This cache brings you to a place to view the
entrance of two of the tunnels. The puzzle is easy with the answers
on the related website above or pick
HERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You cannot approach the tunnels or enter them. They are
fenced off by the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did construction start on the subway? 192B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did construction stop? 19Z5&lt;/p&gt;

The container is a match safe painted a flat dark gray.  It contains a log scroll and a prize for the FTF.  The log scroll is secured with a twist-tie to make it easier to get out.  Please re-secure it for the other cachers that will come along after you.  Be sure to bring your own writing instrument to sign the log.

The cache is located in a high-muggle area, so plenty of stealth is required.  Be sure to cap the cache securely and place it back as you found it.

 Located at the north end of this tunnel.

CL&amp;N RR Tunnel

This tunnel was built by the Cincinnati, Lebanon, &amp; Northern Railroad in 1881. It measures about 1/3 mile in length with a 19ft. bore and originally served two narrow gauge tracks but was later converted to single track standard gauge. The north portal is located under the NE corner of Oak St. and May St., two blocks east of Bethesda Hospital and just east of I-71. The tunnel's south portal emerges in a cut between William Howard Taft and McMillan St., parallel to the N 71 entrance ramp. There is a short underpass of identical brick construction under McMillan St. just south of the southern tunnel portal which is visible from I-71 during the winter months. The south approach to the tunnel parallel to I-71 ascended a 3.4% grade but the tunnel itself is level.

In the 1920's this line reportedly generated more freight in a five mile stretch than any other in the Cincinnati area. One 1927 proposal called for construction of a double-track elevated line over the CL&amp;N for use by the Rapid Transit Loop, however the line would have had to diverge from the existing railroad alignment in the tunnel vicinity.

The tunnel was still in operation when I-71 was constructed and until the late 1980's. Other remaining pieces of the line include a pair of bridges over I-71, one near the old Natural History Museum (now Channel 9) and the other just north of Blair Ave. and south of Victory Parkway. The wooden approaches of an overpass at Florence Ave. north of Dorchester also remain. The CL&amp;N right-of-way has been purchased by SORTA and part will almost certainly be used eventually by rail transit north of Dana Ave. What if any right-of-way between downtown and that point will be used is unclear.   

There is still some possibility that the tunnel will return to active status, as it and some remaining right-of-way have periodically been reconsidered as an alternate route for the downtown approach of a new light rail transit line. However the single track bottleneck may once again eliminate the tunnel from mass transit consideration, although for some time a single track arrangement on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge was considered for the I-71 line, so anything is possible.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No, the cache is not buried.  &quot;Underground&quot; like a subway.  This is the second Cincinnati subway tunnel located near Central Parkway. 

 It's an easy park and search a little.  You can park across the street on Central Parkway (except 4-6 weekdays).  The coordinates are near the concrete fence, but you do not need to cross the fence to get the cache.

The best viewing of the tunnel entrance is a little further north of the cache.  There's another hide/tunnel south of here (link above):

Permission was obtained from HVL POA, as this is property of HVL subdivision. Bring pen to sign the log, and it is about a 10-15 minute hike from parking area.

  The easiest way to get to this cache is follow the paved walking trail past the concession stand straight back all the way to the end past the play ground.  At this spot, turn right, go straight, (you will pass &quot;Why is this Here?&quot; cache.  Take the path to the left, head all the way to the trees.  Walk through some grass to find the start of the dirt trail in the woods which leads to the cache. 

History:  500' south of this cache is a broad topographic high area that reportedly was created and used to supply fill materials during the construction of I-275.  The area is relatively void of trees and can be seen on Google maps as a broad circular feature surrounded by trees.  I wouldn't recommend walking that way because it might be private property.

 I hope to hide a series of caches along the Little Miami bike trail to encourage one of my favorite forms of caching - geobiking! These will require zero bushwacking, but some stealth (especially with muggle hikers as the muggle bikers will tend to be zipping by and not take much notice) since portions of the trail can be quite popular and the caches will be located on the trail. 

Note while the bike trail is open 24 hours some of the parking isn't.

Cache with confidence - cache was place with permission of the Alan Ferguson, Park Manager, Cowan Lake Region - Ohio State Parks.

I have yet to see any deer on the this portion of the trail (I have on the less travled northern sections), but in this location the fencing is lowered so it must be true.

Note: The grab can be made while on the trail.  You don't need to be wandering off the trail property to make the grab.

 The coordinates listed will bring you to a place to retrieve the coordinates for the final.

If you start at Avoca Park it'll be about a 3.5 mile round trip.

You do not need to leave the trail to make the grab on either cache.  (Although near the final is a neat old train drainage tunnel.  Each stone is labeled for placement!)

Since people have had some trouble finding here are coordinates I had from a different GPS reading:

When you get to the final I think you'll understand WHY this was done as a multi!

 Just in case you didn't know. The bike trail was once the path of the little miami railroad system.  I'll have to add some history to one of these caches.

At this location you'll see some evidence of the rail system.

Note: to make the grab you do not need to leave the trail or cross the railing.

There is a very small gravel spot to park right by the sign &quot;Moeller Park&quot;.  This is a park that is primarily used for boaters getting to and from the lake down there.

This is kind of steep in spots, but at least I didn't make you walk all the way down!

 The Little Miami Railroad was chartered on March 11, 1836.  This cache is located on one of the last mile post markers left from the RR.  The marker is the type used by the PennCentral Railroad about 100 years ago.  It is MP 106,This marker is 106 miles to the train station in Columbus Ohio.  Have fun trying to find the cache and reset the cache just as you found it.

There's another cache at another marker (97)

It's about, oh, 9 miles up the trail.... :-)

 I hope to hide a series of caches along the Little Miami bike trail to encourage one of my favorite forms of caching - geobiking! These will require zero bushwacking, but some stealth (especially with muggle hikers as the muggle bikers will tend to be zipping by and not take much notice) since portions of the trail can be quite popular and the caches will be located on the trail.

Note while the bike trail is open 24 hours some of the parking isn't.

Cache with confidence - cache was place with permission of the Alan Ferguson, Park Manager, Cowan Lake Region - Ohio State Parks.

You see some bike riders listening to music on the trail.  Not really a good idea - better to listen for that faster pedaler coming up behind you.  Even at 15 MPH I can hear the birds that don't frequent my suburb, or a loud creek nearby.  So be sure to cache without your headphones.

A  sinkhole, also known as a sink, shake hole, swallow hole, or swallet is a natural depression or hole in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock, often both, by water. Sinkholes may vary in size from less than a meter to several hundred meters both in diameter and depth, and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. They may be formed gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide. These terms are often used interchangeably though many will distinguish between those features into which a surface stream flows and those which have no such input.
 
 
 
Mechanisms of formation may include the gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table.
 
 
 
Sinkholes are usually but not always linked with karst landscapes. In such regions, there may be hundreds or even thousands of sinkholes in a small area so that the surface as seen from the air looks pock-marked, and there are no surface streams because all drainage occurs sub-surface.
 
Wikipedia defines Karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a layer or layers of soluble bedrock, usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite. [1]
 
Due to subterranean drainage, there may be very limited surface water, even to the absence of all rivers and lakes. Many karst regions display distinctive surface features, with sinkholes or dolines being the most common. However, distinctive karst surface features may be completely absent where the soluble rock is mantled, such as by glacial debris, or confined by a superimposed non-soluble rock strata. Some karst regions include thousands of caves, even though evidence of caves that are big enough for human exploration is not a required characteristic of karst.

&lt;br/&gt;
All you need is some info about riding trails and one answer is
the&lt;br/&gt;
Rails to Trail
Conservancy.&lt;br/&gt;
This is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages trails
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the&lt;br/&gt;
best&amp;lt; site features for geocachers is the ability to download a
GPX&lt;br/&gt;
file&amp;lt; of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include
restrooms, parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the
trail itself can be downloaded into many software packages. For
instance you could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or
use the GPX file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to
export to your GPS.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is accessible via the Little Miami Bike Trail Trail.

 I hope to hide a series of caches along the Little Miami bike trail to encourage one of my favorite forms of caching - geobiking! These will require zero bushwacking, but some stealth (especially with muggle hikers as the muggle bikers will tend to be zipping by and not take much notice) since portions of the trail can be quite popular and the caches will be located on the trail. 

Note while the bike trail is open 24 hours some of the parking isn't.

Cache with confidence - cache was place with permission of the Alan Ferguson, Park Manager, Cowan Lake Region - Ohio State Parks

Although there is a covered picnic table here, it tends to be muggle free.

 Nothing fancy here, just a serious hike.  If you've been here before you know what the name means.  From the parking it is pretty much due east - and UP and then DOWN and then UP again.  A great view from the last UP.

Sometimes it's the hide
Sometimes it's the container
Sometimes it's the puzzle
This time it's the view.

There's a nontrackable version of my geocoin for the FTF!

 It's all to easy to buzz down the trail at 13 MPH and miss the sights.  I'll try to cache so so you can stop and check things out.

This is a tiny park dedicated to the history of Camp Dennison.  The camp was established during the Civil War as a training camp.  It was named after the governor of Ohio at the time.  Later it was turned in a hospital camp.  Morgan's raiders came near it, but avoided it thinking it was still a training camp.  

The park has a sign with more history, a cannon, and other signage.  If you are there on a Sunday stop by the Waldschmidt house.  He was a German-American vertern of the Civil war who moved here afterwards and started many businesses in the area.  His house and a small civil war museum are open ever Sunday 1-4.  It's worth and hour side trip.

You are looking for a 35mm film canister.

The historical house is just down the street.  My son and I went for a tour of it and the civil war museum they have there. 

 In 1794, Christian Waldschmidt, a veteran of the American Revolution, moved his family to a site on the Little Miami River and built a new community called New Germany. In 1804, he built his home, which included a store. Waldschmidt was a businessman and encouraged new settlement, staffing a church and helping to found a school, and beginning industries vital to the survival of his new home, such as Ohio's first paper mill, a cooperative distillery, woolen mill, sawmill, and a blacksmith shop.

During the Civil War, the house and surrounding grounds were part of Camp Dennison, used primarily as a general training center, recruiting depot, and hospital post, and named in honor of Governor William Dennison. The main house, now known as Waldschmidt House, served as the headquarters for General Joshua Bates.

Over the years, the house fell into disuse and near ruin. In 1941, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Kroger of Cincinnati, who had purchased the property, gave the house to the Ohio Society Daughters of the American Revolution (OSDAR) and donated $5,000 to start the restoration. Immediately following WWII, OSDAR began the restoration. In 1953, the house was dedicated and opened to the public as a museum.

OSDAR purchased adjoining property including a smaller fieldstone house that Christian Waldschmidt built for his daughter when she married. This house was used as a guard house for Camp Dennison during the Civil War and was restored and opened as the Camp Dennison Civil War Museum in 1998. The Ohio Society continues to collect objects of interest to the period, as we establish this new museum.

In 1989, the Ohio Society completed the construction of a memorial museum barn honoring the Bicentennial of the Northwest Ordinance. It now houses an extensive collection of primitive stone cutting and farm tools, as well as a restored Conestoga wagon. The Memorial Barn is used for meetings and other programs of the Ohio Society DAR.

The Christian Waldschmidt House is considered one of the best examples of Pennsylvania Dutch architecture west of the Allegehenies. Since opening, DAR members have researched and collected pieces of early Americana, and the furnishings include many original pieces used by the Waldschmidt family. Criteria for acceptance of items as gifts to the house are: 1) prior to 1831; 2) Civil War period relating to Camp Dennison; 3) any artifact belonging to Christian Waldschmidt or his descendants.</groundspeak:long_description>

 No puzzle this time.  This little park could use the extra traffic. There are 2 parking lots.  One you enter from Montogomery Road to the North and another from Plainfield Road to the west.

 A lot has changed in this park since I was a boy - mostly for the better.  The artillery pieces are still there, but part of a very nice veterns memorial.  There's 2 groups of play sets now and and built in &quot;corn hole&quot; set.  The tiny pool was filled in years ago.  But I miss the suicidal monkey bars [banned from all parks since Bill Cosby's comedy albums :-) - albums, you know, the vinyl kind?], the 30 foot high slide, and a merry-go-around you could spin so fast you and your buddies could get dizzy - or go flying off of it! And &quot;Old Betsy&quot; (background) and antique firetruck you could play on, is replaced with a fire truck playset.  Oh well, times change.  Now the entire park is immaculate.  So well manicured it's hard to hide a cache.  I hope this hide survives.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt; I was amazed no one else had cached here yet. It's beautiful park
in Sycamore Township. It has been updated much since I was a kid:
Shelterhouse with a fireplace, all updated play equipment, and a
creek. It has it all. I do miss the old Patton tank they used to
have there, but it would look kind of out of place now. 
&lt;p&gt;I found the clues for this cache in the first chapter of a most
popular book a New American gave me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39 deg 13. [1:9] [45:11] [1:31]&lt;/p&gt;

 The city of Reading utility company started in the 1800's and they had their own water system up until the 1990's.  The are signs here telling the story.  Apparently, the money to bill this park came from the EPA pay-off when they forced Reading to close down their company and use CWW water system.

However it got funded - it's a pleasant place to sit and eat your lunch on a sunny day.</groundspeak:long_description>

Note: my GPS reception was a little iffy when hid - may need to use
hint and expand the search a little. &lt;br/&gt; As recently as 1996, this park had one of those 30 foot high
tort-magnet slides. Now a more liability-friendly one sits in it's
place. There's a playset here, basketball court, and tennis court.
While the park is for kiddies, the hide isn't. I'd suggest
approaching it from the south (= from below).

Where QBC and D are codes that can be
retrieved from the caches Sun through Pluto below. I felt feel to
put this cache anywhere the far end solar system because Eris orbit
ranges from 38 to 97 AU from the Sun.  Eris is called a plutoid or
trans-Neptunian dwarf planet.  A number of these have been
found: Seda, Orcus, Makemake, Haumea.  It is due to these other
discoveries that it became apparent that Pluto fell into this
family of object much better than the planets – hence
it's &quot;demotion&quot; from planet status.
This cache had to be a multi due to proximity of another cache. The final cache is at 1 of 3 places depending on what you see EAST of coordinates as you are standing there. 

If you see nothing but trees the final is at: N39 38.141 W83 59.438

This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

 For those who like to get off the trail some.  I've found fresh water clamp shells the size of my hand here.

There's a nice dirt trail off the bike trail leading down to the river - little bushwhacking.

I don't like micros in the woods any more than anyone else, so there is an extensive hint available.

Can be wet.  The river gage was at 3.5 feet (May 30th) when I hid this.  You can check at

 A tribute cache to Alan who is the land manager for the bike trail from the south where it borders the HCPD section of the trail to hedges road.  Alan also is the contact for Cesaer Creek and Cowan lake park regions.  He has been great to work with in getting permits to place geocaches in these very interesting areas.</groundspeak:long_description>

 I lucked out with this location.  It has it all: close to the highway interchange, off street parking, close to my home (so I can keep it stocked), and a muggle resistant hide for a decent size container.  

Not much interesting at this site.  On the east side of the highway there's a neat spot and a cache.

The cache belongs behind the tree, against the fence under the geopile. There's a short and easy geo-trail in. Please replace as you find it!</groundspeak:long_description>

I once found the cache in the open, but all seemed OK.  Every time I check on it though, it is not well hidden.  So I moved a little south.  Upgraded the container (ammo can) and hid better.  I've marked every TB not in the cache as of today as &quot;missing&quot; they may not have been logged by someone who grabbed them.  Please rehide well - I'm concerned about a serial muggling.</groundspeak:text>

 The new container is small so please NO SWAG !! Please REHIDE WELL  - muggles are everywhere.

I think this will work out as decent Tbug motel. It has easy access for commuters and interstate travelers to drop off and pick up trackables. 


There's easy access through the honeysuckle about 30' north of GZ.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The highest part of this park overlooks the Mill Creek valley.  It's a beautiful view - bring your camera!  This is a multi-puzzle hybrid.  A 3 part multi-stage would COULD take as little as a 1/2 hour from finding the 1st stage to back on the road. 

 NOTE:  I have added another style of key.

The coordinates above are the first stage.  A small container with some keys in it.  The keys hold the clues to the second and third stages.  (You do not have to do the stages in order.  There is no clue at stage 2 to help with stage 3.)   All 3 caches are in the same park. 

Stage 2 is located at:

N 39 15. _ _ _
W 084  24._ _ _

Where the key gives you the last six numbers.

Stage 3 : The key gives you the clues for this stage as well.  These clues are more graphical in nature versus numerical.

(Note: there are 2 keys in the 1st stage to minimize the chance that you show up and some one else has &quot;checked out&quot; the key and is busy using it.  If both are checked out, you might want to wait 5 minutes and they should be back.)

NOTE: You CANNOT read the keys with the device you would normally use to write to them. There are at least two places within 1/4 mile (5 minute drive) where the keys can be used - one is open 24 hrs.

An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

 It's so difficult for a cache to stand out.  What's another guardrail or light pole cover, or ammo box in the woods?  I'm always trying to find some wrinkle to make each cache a little different, a little unique.

The cache container in this case has the same problem.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is not located at the listed
coordinates. The final coordinates are at:
 N39 15.BWA W 084 15.ZVX
Where BWA and ZVX are codes that can be
retrieved from the caches Sun through Pluto below. I felt free to
put this cache anywhere in the solar system because meteors can
show up anywhere. There is not much difference between a meteor and
an asteroid except the meteor doesn't fall into the orbit with the
rest of the asteroids.

 It seems like all the fun challenges are up in Dayton, so I'm planting a few here.  

There is a similar challenge in the Dayton area that I have executed twice - so why not lie down the gauntlet to other geocachers.

I have found 106 in one 24 hour period and 111 in one calendar day.  You only need 100 in a day twice to sign!

When you are finished with the challenge simply log all your finds and make  bookmark(s) and than come grab this one or provide the date(s) you did the challenge.



It's not as hard as it sounds!

Note: this cache isn't a 3.5/1.5, but finding 100 easy ones in one day will fell like it....</groundspeak:long_description>

 Here are some details.

Location: 
The coordinates above are approximate.  They won't do you much good anyway.  The only way to locate the cache is knowing that it's in the third vertical tube when approaching from the West Trailhead while &quot;in&quot; the trail.  (From the East side you are on your own!) This tube is generally dry.

Terrain:
Here's the details.  Might be soggy during rains. I think you are pretty much guaranteed to get wet (maybe up to your knees!)  There may be some debris to side step.   Flashlight required.  If you are tall you'll be bent over a good part of the way.  Is this fun or going too far?  You be the judge and log it!

I wouldn't do this alone and do follow all gc.com safety suggestions.

Bring writing instrument.  You may be able to open the cache and extract the log without detaching the cache.  Don't drop it! :-)

 In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Shaker Trace Trail. This trail runs through the Hamilton County Park District’s Miami Whitewater Forest. There’s parking near N39 15.657 W84 44.686.

The trail is 8 miles long.</groundspeak:long_description>

play train with fountain and an actual train caboose for the kids
to climb on. There are several restaurants nearby and soon the
Sharonville Fine Arts center. There’s a Sharonville Historical
Center 1 block away across from the Ameristop. There’s free public
parking behind Cliff’s Hardware. Busy area, so unless you are bold,
it’ll be best in the evening or weekends.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Also on Depot Square are round plaques detailing Sharonville
history. You’ll get the final coordinates from these plaques. The
first one is located near the caboose at coordinates listed above
and they run in front of Cliff’s Hardware. The clues below give the
missing numbers above (and below). Each plaque has a date listed on
the bottom (in parentheses below) as well as info in the text.
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is located at N 39 16.ABC W 084 24.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Henry Runyan purchased settled here around 1791.
(178D-17ZA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Adrian Hageman settles on how many acres? 8EY (1794)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The town of Sharon was started with 71 lots and F7 people
(18RX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Erie Canal was located just west of Sharon (18SD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Crescentville came into existence. By 189A there were 1B
houses. In 18Z7 there was a 2 -room school house. (18SX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Sharon began its railroad history. (187Q)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) When Sharon changed to “Sharonville” (187C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) Sharonville had a racetrack! (19RF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) Sharonville became a city when its population reached 5BEY
(19CQ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note I list the # multiple times in case you got a number
mistaken. You should get the same # twice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a micro cache in the area that contains a hint for
the final cache. It’s located at ( N 39 16.QRW W 084 24.XYZ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is within easy walking distance. The hint below is
for the micro cached hint. I tried to theme the cache with railroad

 http://rps3.com/Files/AGW/Rutan.AGWdataAnalysis%20v11.pdf



 
…or are you getting warmer?
 
 
 
The coordinates above are bogus and maybe you’ll think this puzzle is too.
 
 
 
This puzzle merely requires answering questions about AGW (human caused global warming.)  Now we’ve all heard from the media how everything is melting, the polar bears are dying and we better do something about it.  Here’s a link to some info that might get you thinking about it.  It is compiled by Burt Rutan, aviation pioneer.  The question below can all be answered going to:
 
 
 
http://rps3.com/Pages/Burt_Rutan_on_Climate_Change.htm
 
 
 
The data can be found elsewhere, but this compilation is the best I’ve seen.  The basic questions are:
 
 
 
1)      Is the earth getting warmer?
 
2)      Are we humans causing it?
 
 
 
Question A:
 
Based on the UN/IPCC own data in presented in 1990, has it ever been warmer in the last 1000 years than it is now?  Has it ever been much cooler?
 
 
 
1)  Yes, Yes
 
2)  Yes, No
 
3) No, Yes
 
4)  No, No
 
 
 
 
 
Question B:
 
Has the RATE of warming ever  been as great as it is now?  And if so, when?
 
 
 
7)  Nope, no way.
 
8)  Yes,    300 BC – 200 BC
 
9) Yes,  1860 - 1880
 
0)  Yes,   1940- 1960
 
 
 
 
 
Question C: 
 
From 2002-2008 has it been getting warmer or cooler based on MSU and Hadley data?
 
 
 
6)  No change
 
7)  Warmer
 
9)  Cooler
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Question D:
 
Based on the temperature data from the Vostok ice cores – what is the nature of the world’s climate in the past 400,000 years
 
 
 
6) Mostly ice ages with small warm periods in between
 
7)  Most moderate with occasionally ice ages
 
8)  Climate was about what it is now.
 
9)   Generally, is was warmer than it is now
 
 
 
Question E:
 
Global warming is supposed to have other atmospheric impact.  Which of the following is getting more severe in the last 100 to 30 years
 
 
 
2) hurricanes
 
3) tornados
 
4)  cyclones
 
5)  U.S.A. floods
 
6)  U.S.A. droughts
 
7) None of the above
 
 
 
Question F:
 
 
 
Does the author believe in climate change?  Does he believe is man is affecting the climate of the planet?
 
 
 
5) Yes, No
 
6) No, No
 
7) Yes, Yes
 
8) No, Yes
 
 
 
 
 
The cache is at
 
 
 
N  39  16.ABC  
 
W 084  21.DEF

small log and fills up fast. You can do the date online - I'll
never challenge whether you found it or not! ) For other covered
bidges check out 5BizzyB's challenge for covered bridge caches

LINK - This bridge doesn't count towards his challenge, but it
might be the only one in Hamilton County. It's not a antique
bridge, but it's nice (and easy). The bridge itself is on private
property, the cache is located on City of Sharonville
property.(Note: one of the houses on the hill is for sale. You
could drive across the bridge and do a &quot;drive by&quot; of the real
estate....) The cache is a park and grab camoflaged nano. You can
park on the side of the road and walk 10' to the hide. Watch for
the arrows on the &quot;No Parking&quot; signs, you can park between some,
and not between some others. (These spots go fast when Mass is on.)
There's a fair amount of traffic on the road, but the cache will
aid you in making a stealthy grab. People frequently park here, so
that won't seem unusal.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Use the hint below if you are nervous about making a quick
stealthy grab.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Per the publishers request, I'll mention that I have contacted the
nearby (2 blocks) school about the cache. The cache itself is
located on City of Sharonville Property and I have their explicit
permission to locate the cache here. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s the cache container&lt;br/&gt;
Sometimes it’s the puzzle&lt;br/&gt;
Sometimes it’s the hide&lt;br/&gt;
 This time it’s the location - so I want the hide and grab to be
easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE REPLACE THE CACHE EXACTLY WHERE YOU FOUND IT !!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

He has also turned me down for many a request too.  But he has always be very gracious and patient to explain to me why some of my  &quot;creative&quot; cache ideas weren't good ideas and/or didn't fit within their guidelines.  So many thanks to Matt - he is the hardest working geocache approver around!

Found this park while scouring for good hiding spots with me matey bigpat54. Phillip's park is a perfect spot for looting and plundering and where I hid me pirate's cache. You'll have to approach the stern side of the park behind the play fields. Start walking the plank...er trail until ye' find a mysterious boken tree down the gulley where X marks the spot.

This is the re-creation of historic Crosley field by the city of Blue Ash. You can see more info below or the link above.

Historic Info:

CROSLEY FIELD Reconstructed for advanced level baseball, the Crosley Field restoration project was formally dedicated to the &quot;Youth of Baseball&quot; in July of 1988. Crosley Field was reconstructed by using the blueprints from the original stadium, including the same field dimensions, grass infield, the infamous outfield terrace, and the same dimensions, height, and angles of the outfield wall. To add to the authenticity of the reconstruction project, the 400+ seat stands on the 3rd baseline comprise of the original stadium seating from Crosley Field.

The scoreboard was reconstructed to simulate the original scoreboard from Crosley when the &quot;last pitch&quot; was thrown on June 24, 1970. No detail was left out in the reconstruction process, including the original sponsors of the Reds and the scores from around the league at that time (see left).</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;
This
is a multi-cache going through little known trails in Sharon Woods
(the county park requires entry fee $3/day $5/year). The
coordinates above bring you to the first clue. There are developed
trails all back through here. This cache only touches a small
portion. There is really no bushwacking involved, but the some of
the later trails have some undergrowth - you might want long pants.
There are no physical caches until the final, all stages are
getting coordinates off signs/posts. BYO pencil/pen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE:
Areas around the trails are reservable. Please be considerate and
not wander into their parties (and mooch snacks!). Also the trail
isn't available from Mid-November through Jan
1st&lt;/b&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

STOP #1 At the coordinates listed above, there is a sign with 3
lines of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
xxxxxxxxxxx&lt;br/&gt;

 xxxxxxxxx&lt;br/&gt;
HIKERS PERMITTED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 A= # of letters in 2nd word top line&lt;br/&gt;
B= # of times the letter &quot;R&quot; 's in 2nd word top line&lt;br/&gt;
C= # of letters in the last word on the second line&lt;br/&gt;
D= # of times the letter &quot;T&quot; 's in the last word on the second
line&lt;br/&gt;
E= # of letters in the last word on the second line&lt;br/&gt;
F= # of vowels in the first word on the top line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Start
your trek to Stop #2 using the trailhead below - just south of
where you are now. You MIGHT be able to get to Stop #2 going up the
road, but the trail &quot;will make all the difference&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#2 is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N
16.ABC W 24.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Stop #2: Deer Exclusion Area:&lt;br/&gt;
There is a small sign here with a phone # on it to call for more
information on the area: (It's such a small fenced in area you
could ask what plants are in there they don't want the deer to
eat!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Phone
# :ABC-72FG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#3 is located at N 16.A(A+B+C)F W 24.(C-1)(G)(A-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#3 : Yellow Sign Post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On
this sign there are two phone #'s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OH:
ABC-DEFG&lt;br/&gt;
KY: QRS-TUVW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#4 is located at: N 16.GRA W 24.VBG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stop
#4: Another Yellow Sign Post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This
stage has given people trouble so here goes... no tricks here - the
coordinates are posted ON the post. It's the same type of post as
the last stop with the telephone #. If the coordinates you get from
the last stage seem a little off - just continue to follow the
trail and look on any posts you see. Since I've gotten som much
feedback I've marked the coordinates of the final cache twice on
the post at the coordinates and also on the post across the road
from the coordinates. I hope this makes it do-able - it's not
supposed to be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a short multi.  All the stages are located around the park.  An easy walk.

The coordinates above will lead you to Patriot Pointe.  From signs and monuments you will be able to derive the coordinates for stage 2.  Stage 2 will give you the location and hint for the final.  Park a the library and you cross a walkway bridge to get to the very tall wall of memorial monuments.

Stage 2 coordinates  

N 39 16.0AB

W 084 24.2YZ

A= Add the digits of the day and the year that Patriot point was dedicated.  For example: Dec 12 2001= 1+2+2+0+0+1=6.  Sign is at the bridge entrance.  (Or the # of memorial signs on the tall wall.)

B= 2 x (The # of biplanes on the WWI memorial)


Y= How many airplanes (not helicopters) are on the Persian Gulf memorial? (including those on the aircraft carrier)

Z=How many airplanes are in the Korean War memorial


Note: one stage is only available 
M-Thurs  10-9  Fri-Sat 10-6

&lt;p&gt;Want to get
into&lt;br/&gt;
geo-biking?  All you need is some info about riding trails
and&lt;br/&gt;
one answer is the Rails to Trail
Conservancy.  This&lt;br/&gt;
is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages
trails&lt;br/&gt;
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the
best&lt;br/&gt;
site features for geocachers is the ability to download a GPX
file&lt;br/&gt;
of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include
restrooms,&lt;br/&gt;
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail
itself&lt;br/&gt;
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance
you&lt;br/&gt;
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the
GPX&lt;br/&gt;
file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to export
to&lt;br/&gt;
your GPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join now and start&lt;br/&gt;
geobiking!&lt;/p&gt;

 I've found there are several accessories that can make geobiking nicer.  An extra water bottle holder is good.  (I do this trick where I freeze the water and gatorade - nothing like a cold drink on the trail...)  A GPS mount is essential.  I broke down and bought a rear bike rack and bad to hold repair tools, spare inner tube, pump, geocache containers, logs .....  :-)

&lt;p&gt;Want to get
into&lt;br/&gt;
geo-biking?  All you need is some info about riding trails
and&lt;br/&gt;
one answer is the &quot;http://www.railstotrails.org/index.html&quot;&amp;gt;Rails to
Trails&lt;br/&gt;
Conservancy.  This&lt;br/&gt;
is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages
trails&lt;br/&gt;
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the
best&lt;br/&gt;
site features for geocachers is the ability to download a GPX
file&lt;br/&gt;
of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include
restrooms,&lt;br/&gt;
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail
itself&lt;br/&gt;
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance
you&lt;br/&gt;
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the
GPX&lt;br/&gt;
file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to export
to&lt;br/&gt;
your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

and I have found all sorts of fossils here - even some trilobites.
Dig up some history while you're caching. &lt;br/&gt; There are trails up to the cache. I added one trailhead below (head
towards cell phone tower to the left facing the hill). Or head to
the right towards the Trilobite sign. Or you can do a little light
bushwacking straight up the hill. Cache is near the trail. 
&lt;p&gt;Note this is a letterbox cache -
please don't take the stamps as swag!&lt;/p&gt;

The answer the Rails to Trails Conservency. 
http://www.railstotrails.org/index.html
You can join for free. There are many features to the website, but one of the best is the ability to download a GPX file of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include restrooms, parking etc. The &quot;track&quot; of the trial itself can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance you could do a PQ in GC.com with it. Or use the GPX file in GSAK to select caches along a bike trail to export to your GPS. Join now and start geobiking!

Actor, John Wayne, played Sean Thornton who has returned from America to reclaim his homestead and escape his past. Sean's eye is caught by Mary Kate Danaher, a beautiful but poor maiden, and younger sister of ill-tempered &quot;Red&quot; Will Danaher. The riotous relationship that forms between Sean and Mary Kate, punctuated by Will's pugnacious attempts to keep them apart, form the main plot, with Sean's past as the dark undercurrent.</groundspeak:long_description>

 I think is is really cool having two bike trail intersect.  It is like an alternate transportation system.   There are large hubs of trails in Dayton and Xenia - old railroad hubs in the day.

 I used to be able to occasionally ride my bike to work.  Wish we had a complete system of trails and areas on the side of roads like they do in other places.  Ah, maybe some day.

In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Lebanon Countryside YMCA trail. This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail. There’s parking near either end. Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA. Near geocache GC235X5 .
The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 . The trail is about 5 miles long. The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

Bushwhacking does serve its purpose.  It's a big help when placing a large or precious container and you REALLY want to discourage muggles.  Some times it can't be avoided - the net place is just off the beaten trail.

Fortunately, for most of my hides on bike trail I tend to avoid it.

 OCD = Obsessive, Compulsive disorder.

  You're out caching, it is getting late.  It's getting dark.  But time for 1 more cache.... !

Geocaching lends itself to being an obsession.  But do fight off getting burned out.  There's seems to be a fair # of folks run around get a couple thousand finds in a year or two - then drop off the radar.  Pace yourself - stay in it for the long haul!  :-D

Since FTF is over....  It's NOT in the nearby gas or electrical equipment.  The coords are good. 

 In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Lebanon Countryside YMCA trail.  This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail.  There’s parking near either end.  Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA.  Near geocache GC235X5 .
The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 .  The trail is about 5 miles long.  The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Following is a Geocaching Addiction Test

Do you have an addiction to geocaching? Only you can answer that question.

Take the following quiz to help put your geocaching in perspective. If you end up answering &quot;yes&quot; to three or more questions, you may want to take a good look how your life is affected by geocaching.

1. Have you missed classes or work because of geocaching?
2. Along those same lines, have you ever taken an entire afternoon for your lunch break because of geocaching?
3. Do you have trouble going anywhere without first checking to see if there is a geocache in that area you have not yet found?
4. Does the sport of geocaching come up in almost all conversations you have?
5. Do you consider the number of geocaches you have found to be guiding your self-confidence?
6. Do you use geocaching to help you relax?
7. Have you left home without something you are supposed to bring (like your spouse) but never without your Geocaching bag?
8. Do you log in to Geocaching.com as soon as you wake up to see if there is a new cache in your area (OK, then how about just before you go to bed)?
9. Do you forget your spouses name, but remember the cache number to your favorite geocache?
10. Have you begged your spouse to take you to the local dollar store to get more &quot;log books&quot;?
11. Do you lie to others about how often you geocache?
12. Has anyone asked you to &quot;Sit down, we need to talk&quot; about your geocaching?
13. We're here to help. This cache is a test to see how addicted to geocaching you really are.

Your goal is to not find this cache.

Can you resist searching out this cache?

Show the world how strong you are. You can stop Geocaching anytime you want. Right?

Really you can...

&quot;Fiiiind meeee...&quot;

Did you hear something off in the distance... ? Never mind. It must have been the wind.

(BTW  I can quit at anytime...  [:D] )

 In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Lebanon Countryside YMCA trail.  This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail.  There’s parking near either end.  Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA.  Near geocache GC235X5 .
The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 .  The trail is about 5 miles long.  The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Feel free to fill in the blank in your log.  Some examples
(Leveraged from the internet....)

… a colleague brings out their Tupperware lunch box and you automatically reach for your pen to sign the log book.

… you can’t walk down a path without thinking, “Hmmm, that’ll be a good place for a cache!”.

… you type in your home co-ords and not the phone number.

… your idea of decorating the Christmas tree is to conceal all the presents at its foot, beneath a camo covering of tinsel.

… your idea of gift-giving is to hide the gifts in the garden with co-ords and a clue.

… you are watching TV and think “That’s a beautiful place, I wonder where the nearest cache is?’”

… you purposely take the kids to McDonalds to buy them a happy meal so you can pinch the toy to use as a swap.

… you leave your PC and First To Find running overnight, with the volume cranked right up – just in case…

… you give directions by which caches are passed, instead of which pubs are passed.

… you start having nightmares about muggled caches.

… you sort through your pockets at the checkout at the supermarket and can only offer Geocoins.

… the Easter Egg hunt you organise for your nephews involves the use of GPs units and is in the form of a Multi.

… you automatically look around to ensure that you are not being observed before opening your lunch box at work.

&lt;p&gt;Want to get into
geo-biking?  All you need is some info about riding trails and
one answer is the Rails to Trails
Conservancy.  This
is a non-profit organization, which creates and manages trails
created from old railway lines, so membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best
site features for geocachers is the ability to download a GPX file
of a trail and its waypoints. The waypoints include restrooms,
parking, and other amenities.  The &quot;track&quot; of the trail itself
can be downloaded into many software packages. For instance you
could use it to create a Pocket Query on GC.com, or use the GPX
file in GSAK to filter caches along a bike trail to export to
your GPS. This cache is accessible via the Lebanon Bike
Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join now and start
geobiking!&lt;/p&gt;

 In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Lebanon Countryside YMCA trail.  This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail.  There’s parking near either end.  Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA.  Near geocache GC235X5 .
The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 .  The trail is about 5 miles long.  The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

 In the continuing quest to populate bike trails with geocaches – I gladly present the Lebanon Countryside YMCA trail. This trail runs from downtown Lebanon, crosses the Little Miami River and connects up with the Little Miami Bike trail. There’s parking near either end. Near Lebanon there’s parking at the YMCA. Near geocache GC235X5 .
The nearest parking on the Little Miami Bike trail is at GC25MR4 . The trail is about 5 miles long. The ride includes some rolling hills and one BIG one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

The caches in the series are:
Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM 
Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR 
Venus     http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKV

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods
mountain biking.  There
are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods
mountain biking.  There
are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for the main mountain bike trails is
at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N39 35.214 W84 46.098&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods
mountain biking.  There
are the defined mountain bike trails, but then virtually ALL the
trails are multi-use. 
While it is a maze of trails they are very well marked.  With the markings, a map, and a
GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent
mountain bikes at the parking location – so you can just try
out mountain biking for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

 There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods mountain biking










There are some unique aspects to Hueston Woods mountain
biking.  There are the defined mountain
bike trails, but then virtually ALL the trails are multi-use.  While it is a maze of trails they are very
well marked.  With the markings, a map,
and a GPS it is pretty easy to find your way around.  There is also a shop to rent mountain bikes at the parking
location – so you can just try out mountain biking for the day.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of a set of caches that is a scale model of the solar system where 1 mile along the Little Miami Bike trail (not a straight line between points) = 1 astronomical unit (AU). An AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth = 92,955,807 miles. At this scale the moon is only 14 feet away from the earth. Hope you enjoy traveling the solar system and appreciate the vast scale of the outer planets! Geocaching sainthood for anyone who rides the whole length in 1 ride! Most are traditionals, but due to cache spacing, etc. a few are multis where the first stage is at the correct distance.
 
The Sun is located near Hedges Road south of Xenia and Pluto is in Loveland. There are codes in each of the caches (A=#, B=#, etc). Record those for some bonus caches (for those who do the whole solar system, that is.) The numbers are recorded on the logs, on laminated sheets, and often written on the containers. If you should ever need to replace a log, please copy the codes onto the replacement log. Note: the caches each have 2 codes for redundancy in case any 1 of caches are temporarily unavailable. The bonus caches are generally in the vincinity of pluto – for anyone who wants to do the ride in one shot.

The caches in the series are:
Sun      http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GXKM 
Mercury    http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OX2GXKR

&lt;strong&gt;American Elm (White Elm)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ulmus
americana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest and most
widespread elm in the United States. The tallest example in Ohio
today, growing in Hamilton County, stands 97 feet. The tall,
drooping crown growing above divided trunks gives the mature tree a
distinctive, vase-like appearance. The tree grows on rich, moist
bottomlands and in ravines, and sometimes on moist slopes and
woodlands. Although widespread in Ohio, many trees have been
destroyed by the Dutch Elm disease. In the past it extensively was
used as a shade and ornamental tree. The wood has been used in much
the same way as that of the 
Slippery Elm. Both birds and mammals feed on fruit and buds,
and mammals will the the bark and twigs of younger
trees.&lt;/p&gt;

The view you see through the&lt;br/&gt;tube is the approximate location of the final coordinates. You'll&lt;br/&gt;have to look around a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you are in the area identified in Step 2, look for the&lt;br/&gt;final coordinates recorded on a fixed object. The coordinates are&lt;br/&gt;not well hidden but will not be obvious to bystanders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination cache is a small plastic jar covered in camo&lt;br/&gt;tape.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, the cache has gone missing twice now, and the tree is in&lt;br/&gt;pieces. So no more climbing. I guess its fitting that Southdale&lt;br/&gt;school nearby changed their mascot from the Purple Panthers to the&lt;br/&gt;district standard Firebirds... Ho hum. I'll leave the old&lt;br/&gt;description here for posterity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American panthers are known by many names. They are&lt;br/&gt;called cougars, mountain lions, catamounts or pumas depending on&lt;br/&gt;who you ask. Not too many panthers call Southwest Ohio home&lt;br/&gt;anymore, but Southdale Elementary has adopted Panthers as their&lt;br/&gt;mascot nonetheless. American panthers are usually about 10 times&lt;br/&gt;the size of the typical housecat. Despite this, they are classified&lt;br/&gt;in the general &quot;small cat&quot; category, since they have the ability to&lt;br/&gt;purr and not roar. They have been known to be able to jump 25 feet&lt;br/&gt;horizontally and 18 feet vertically. And like any other cat, they&lt;br/&gt;have an uncanny ability to climb trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;READ THIS!: Avoid the part without bark, it is crumbling. The&lt;br/&gt;cache is in plain view, so spot it before trying to retrieve&lt;br/&gt;it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some general rules for the cache...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -Do not attempt alone! It will be much easier and safer with a&lt;br/&gt;caching partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -Do not attempt in wet or foul weather!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -Do not attempt at dawn, dusk, twilight, or any variation of&lt;br/&gt;night!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -Do not attempt if you are not in good physical condition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -And most importantly... if you weigh over 175 lbs or so don't try&lt;br/&gt;to retrieve the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small container with room only for very small trade&lt;br/&gt;items. Do not attempt to sign log and trade items at the cache's&lt;br/&gt;location. Instead, hand it to your partner and retreat from the&lt;br/&gt;cache site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;i&gt;Original contents: Log and pencil, shell lei, Eisenhower&lt;br/&gt;dollar&lt;/i&gt;

This park is a great spot to sit down on one of the&lt;br/&gt;park benches and watch the world drive by. Read the plaque on&lt;br/&gt;Patterson, too. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suggest parking on the east end of Thruston Blvd. and walking&lt;br/&gt;across the street.

I saw this one pop up this morning and thought about sending an e-mail to gallaghd or ghs, so they could add another FTF to their long lists, but then I thought &quot;Hey, you can grab this one on your lunch hour.&quot;  So, I popped the coords into my Garmin Dakota and off I went.  I knew within a few feet where it was, seeing that I drive by here at least 5 days each week.

I arrived, glad that there was not a service vehicle already parked there, and started my search.  I got to within 3 feet of the posted coordinates and found the cache.

The cache is a larger than normal container filled with fun swag. It is kid friendly and fairly easy to find. It is located on the Cope Environmental Center grounds which are open and free to the public from dawn to dusk, 365 days a year.

This cache was originally placed June 29th as part of a geocaching adventure for Cope's 2006 Conservation Camp. That afternoon 22 fifth and sixth graders were introduced to geocaching for the first time, and they loved it!</groundspeak:long_description>

placed this cache on 9/17/09 while paddling without
a shuttle along the Mad River.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had to hitch-hike/walk back
to my vehicle, after floating to many great
caches. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Big Thank You to a random
soul named Zach for taking a chance, and giving this crazy looking
tattooed freak a lift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  However,  the title is not
a &quot;Thank You&quot; aimed at Zach, it is a BIG &quot;THANK YOU&quot; to all of the
cachers/hiders in the Dayton area that have placed fabulous terrain
challenges for me to find.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am
pulled West by all of these great
caches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THANK
YOU:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will add to this list as time
passes, and I get to try more of your local
caches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The terrain rating for this cache may need adjusted. I
came in by kayak, which may, or may not be the easy way. Please let
me know in your logging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

GC1YT0H 


Thank
You  &lt;strong&gt;on the Mad River), as a
gesture of appreciation for all of the great terrain challenge
caches in the Dayton area.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 This one is in the same spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
However, it would probably be close to a 4.5 even without the boat
(maybe).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you see the cache,
and say  &quot;No
Thanks&quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with
bringing your own pen/writing utensil, I suggest bringing something
to tie yourself off with while making the grab. I used no equipment
when placing the cache, However, it is in a very tricky
spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE
SAFE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to
slammer47
for being the FTF on 9/28/09!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is located in Shawnee Prairie Preserve, west edge of Greenville, off St. Rt. 502. N40*05.929-W084*38.826.
(For the Birds II replaces the archieved For the Birds,after 33 logged visits, which flew (floated) away. A new hunt if yours is a return visit)
If you fly the cache is about .33 miles from parking, .48 if you walk and find the right trails.
It started out as a BIRD theme cache, full of bird crafts and toys. Plan ahead and honor the theme.
A &quot;Pathfinder&quot; brochure would be helpful. Stop by the Nature Center (Mon.-Sat. 9-5)
Cache is hidden just off trial. Please stay on established trails.

If you want a trail map and other info park at the mid-trail bulliten board at Prairie Ridge: N40*06.290, W084*38.085. Be careful crossing Broadway. Please use the desinated parking and trail, avoid private property.
This is a historically significant place...so an Ohio history/symbols/icons theme for the cache! Initial contents include Ohio history and Ohio symbols momentos. Honor the theme if possible.

An easy 1/4 mile hike, The first half is fully accessable, then it may get a little muddy. The cache is just off the trail and well hidden, with tree canopy to mess with your GPS.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Coppess Nature Sanctuary is the oldest Darke County Park and its donation was the catalyst for the creation of the Park Disrict. A gentle, level trail loops this 32-acre woodland.

Trailhead parking, maps and other information is off Young Road at N40*12.932'-W084*43.661'
An easy, family friendly walk in a woodland reminiscent of pre-settlement Darke County. Enjoy the loop trail after you log the cache. You'll find the cache full of kid friendly critters.

There are caches in 5 other Darke County Parks!

Placed w/ permission from State Park and placed by Darke County Parks' Extreme Adventure Camp 2010.

The lake was flooded while placed, but this is well above that flooded level. Please return to it's location and make sure it is hidden and secure.

You will need to exit your boat and proceed along the shore roughly 10 feet from the lake's edge. *Secure your boat!*

Rating is based on the fact that a boat is required and you have to hop along the rocks a bit to find this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Going from the hint (being a LOTR fan), the cache was not where I thought it must obviously be.  The coordinates led me exactly where I thought, but the cache was hidden in a similar hiding place nearby.  It may have possibly been moved?????

We signed the log and Izzy swapped a small toy for a whistle.  Very neat old cemetery and cool cache.

transport you to adventure and fun.

Geokeys are not portkeys like you read about in books. They should however help motivate you to get out and unlock your own way to adventure.
 I first met Rusty &amp; Libby at a MiGO Event. Rusty is one of the MiGO founders, a reviewer, and Pathtag High Muckity Muck. We now run into each other at many events.
I spent over a year looking for a cache container beautiful and charming enough to match Libby but in the end had to settle for something gross and decrepit like Rusty.

[red]WARNING APROCH WITH EXTREM CAUTION[/red]

This cache is located in MacCready Reserve part of
MSU’s Extension Service. Dawn to Dusk, dogs on leash, no bikes.
 [green]Leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but pictures,
kill nothing but time.[/green]
 



[red]ANNUAL HUNTING CLOSURE The MacCready Reserve will close at dusk on Nov. 14th and will re-open at dawn on Dec. 1st.

What is the Falling Water Trail? The Falling Water Trail is a 10.5mile linear trail based on the old Michigan Central railroad bed.It runs between Weatherwax Drive, Jackson, and the Village of Concord,Michigan. The Falling Water Trail is a major east-west component of the Jackson CountyRegional Trail plan, connecting Cascades, Ella Sharp, Lime Lake and Swains Lake parks in Jackson County. You are looking for a well camoed container that is out in the open just off to the side of the trail. It is a small container that will not hold large TB's or trade iteams. PARKING for the trail is at both ends and in the middle. These are south of the trail a ways on Weatherwax in Jackson, and Teft Rd. near Spring Arbor, and right at the end on River St. in Concord. You are not allowed to park at the crossing roads.
Container is a 1 foot X 6 inch diameter thermos.</groundspeak:long_description>

He had already done this one so he had a good time watching me look all over the place.  I think I even had my hand on it once.   Found at 2:45pm. TN L-SC.

Was my first bike trip of the year, think I will pay for it tomorrow.  Had a very good day as I did not get any DNFs today either.  Was great seeing all the nature: lots of birds, blue jays, cardinals, swans, cranes and more.  This cache is going to need a new log soon.    Found cache about 11:50 AM for my 11466 find.

transport you to adventure and fun

Geokeys are not portkeys like you read about in books. They should
however help motivate you to get out and unlock your own way to
adventure. It may just be me but it seems that any wooded area that
I go too in Michigan has a cache or two placed by TreePlanter. Some
are easy hides while others will have you scratching your head, or
maybe pulling out your hair! This cache is not in a woods but I did
place it in a tree. If you find yourself in a graveyard you are in
the right place. Take time to look around especially at the stones
marked with a flag. Many who fought in the Civil War, WW I, and WW
II rest here. The flag nearest to the cache stands by a stone
marking the grave of “A Soldier of the Revolution”.

grandparents and others buried here. Even though it is an old
cemetery I knew over half the people resting here. Some were very
old when I was very young. The cache is a small yellow tube, and is

mind.

This is located on private property, but since this is my home it is here with my permission. If you are poking around in Mrs. Geoaddict's flowers, you need to let your GPSr settle down first. Parking is available on Grant and Pierce streets. During non-school hours you may also park in the school parking lot.

Some people have mentioned that they feel uncomfortable hunting on private property. My family and I are okay with geocachers hunting on our property. By the way, the cache is not very far off the sidewalk and near our driveway.

I love the cache! I didn't see anyone looking out of the window at me. What do neighbors say? The container and location were excellent! T: water resistant container L: koozie

Little did I know that I'll be back a little later.

Daughter Geoness and I met owner out on his front long and had a really nice chat. The cache is an extremely nice find where we traded swag for some trinkets tha Geoness likes with some of my signature first aid kits. Also traded travel bugs that I had retrieves from Raleigh, NC and will bring these back down with me.

Great Cache!

One of the first
caches in Michigan which uses Chirp technology to locate the
cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache requires special equipment. In order to find
this cache you must have a Garmin Oregon, Dakota, GPSMAP 62, GPSMAP
78 or a Colorado running the latest software which supports Garmin
chirp. Note: You may need to download a software update to enable
Chirp.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The posted coordinates is the entrance to the park. Make sure you
have the chirp enabled when you enter the park. I was hoping that
while driving to the parking lot you would get the CHIRP info you
need. This seemed to only work about 50% of the time. So I suggest
you walk the road from the Y in the road to the parking lot to find
it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The final coordinates are given via a Chirp. There is no other way
to get the 2nd stage coordinates. If you don't have the right
equipment, I'm sure you have a friend who does.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The final should be easy to find so no hint is given. Have
fun!&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: CH2H96M - CHIRP Location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FL2H96M - Cache final Location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Toys for the boyz, this is a chirp so special equipment is required. Check to see if you GSPr is capable. I can help others out that do not have the equipment if you dont mind me trailing along while you hunt.

Placed this small ammo can for the boys. A dozen hot wheels cars to start and some other small things. Didn't have any dolls i mean action figures for it.  Don't expect this to be a park and grab.  It isnt to far off the blue trail but the blue trail is 3.8 miles long. There are other caches along the way as well.
 This is a Chirp cache. You will need a Garmin capable device to receive the signal then you can proceed to the actual cache container. Check your device and its software to know if you can recive the data. some day soon their may even be a iPhone app for this or so the rumor goes.

 Congrats to thevidas for the FtF

Decided on the Lake Lansing Park North. we got about half way to the furthest cache and it started to rain, figured we were wet one way or the other might as well continue on and get the caches. Found cache about 12:50 PM for my 2nd find.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a pretty simple hide. Terrain is a 1.5 only because of&lt;br/&gt;stairs and gravel grade which would make it not easily accessable&lt;br/&gt;for those with chairs/walkers. The grade is not steep, and other&lt;br/&gt;than wandering through some weeds, it should be easy walking. No&lt;br/&gt;swamping, or serious bushwhacking needed, but who knows what'll&lt;br/&gt;happen once things green up :) Good luck and enjoy. Cache is a&lt;br/&gt;small (Micro) container, with log book and pencil however no room&lt;br/&gt;for trade items. It is NOT similar to it's surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, the original cache had long been archived while construction work was going on.  It seems that wanted to make this area a little easier to see, so they've installed steps, a viewing platform, a few benches, and restroom facilities.  

The cache is a simple one, but will involve many stairs, hence the 1.5 rating. No off trail travel will be needed. Please respect the area, it gets more beautiful each time I stop by. Hope you enjoy the view, I've always thought it was a great one.</groundspeak:long_description>
