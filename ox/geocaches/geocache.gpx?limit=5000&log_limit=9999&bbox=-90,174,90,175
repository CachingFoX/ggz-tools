Its commanding views over the Hauraki Gulf and inner harbour have made it an important lookout and defence site for centuries, first for early Maori inhabitants and later for European settlers.&lt;br/&gt;North Head was one of a number of defence forts that were rapidly set up in the late 1800s to defend Auckland from a feared Russian attack. The fort was later expanded as part of Auckland's coastal defence system during World Wars I and II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complex of tunnels, guns, searchlights and other fortifications make this a fascinating area to explore. It is now a historic reserve managed by the Department of Conservation.&lt;br/&gt;North Head (named Maungauika by Maori) is a taonga with many special places. The tangata whenua have a spiritual, cultural and historical relationship with their taonga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was first published on geocaching.com but was rejected as being to close to a multi way point</groundspeak:long_description>

They had tonnes of energy to burn off so we ran through the walkway in the reserve between the waypoint and final, and then spent some time on the playground equipment near the final. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This quick easy multi takes you through a short walkway to a playground within a reserve on Hill Road. You can park at WP1 and work out the co-ordinates for the final, which will take you about 5mins to walk to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WP1 there is a big wooden sign. Using the letters on the sign, where A=1, B=2, C=3 etc, complete the co-ordinates below to find the final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final is at S41º 1T.2UV, E174º WX.0YZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where;&lt;br/&gt;T = second letter in the first word&lt;br/&gt;U = last letter in last word + 1&lt;br/&gt;V = first letter in second word - 5&lt;br/&gt;W = second letter in third word&lt;br/&gt;X = fourth letter in third word&lt;br/&gt;Y = last letter in first word - 7&lt;br/&gt;Z = third letter in second word - 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We trust you enjoy the cache, and younger cachers get to burn off some energy!&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: DC2FCJK - DC Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

Only a moderate breeze blowing today but enough to get the wheels turning.Wasn't sure if the small badge was an FTF  prize or supposed to be swag, took it as the former but happy to put something else small in when I get a chance to go back past.There are caches in the area from the competing website, but I think the placements are such that there shouldn't be too much confusion.</groundspeak:text>

Follow the track up the hill.&lt;br/&gt; - enter via the marked entrance at Huntleigh Park (Ngaio) and find your way along the tracks.&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to enter private property via either route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose the correct forks in the path, generally going uphill. This cache is at ground level right beside a track. Don't loose sight of the track and become lost in your search! Be watchful of children, as the Wellington City Council sometimes sets poison bait off the tracks (although there was none nearby when this cache was placed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache location: S41.15.012 E174.45.835&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a 16x11x8cm clear plastic box.

From there you can descend into Johnsonville, Khandallah or Ngaio if desired.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The trade items listed on the cache page are gone and have been replaced with some cash and a pair of sunnies. The logbook had been filled in November but not logged here — muggles?

I found the cache easily enough because the park is virtually on my back door and I had a pretty good idea where to look which is just as well as with the GPS bouncing all over the place due to the poor signal under the canopy.  It might pay to expand on the clue and describe the area where the hint is located because there is heaps of hints to look in with the dodgy signal found in the bush.</groundspeak:text>

Usual issues with GPS reception here, so gave up on my GPS and found the cache almost immediately by cacher's instinct- however once I was at GZ I did an averaged reading which said the coordinates were only .2 out on latitude and OK on longitude with an accuracy of 5 metres. Watch out if approaching from above by the fence, there is a big hole which I didn't see as I was watching the GPS at that stage, could have damaged my ankle but fortunately no harm done.
TFTC.
I am a VUW graduate though from way back and not in science disciplines. As I am rather a fossil, at the time I was there the place was totally different and none of the buildings close to the GZ were even thought of!
Log was damp, did manage to sign though with difficulty, owner has since attended to that (thanks.)   I note the reference to the FTF, a bit of a tricky situation when a cache  is cross-listed as the FTF doesn't even show as a found log on this site! (I suggest that the FTF should only be listed in the cache description on the site where it is logged, though if a cache description is cross- posted that doesn't work!)</groundspeak:text>
