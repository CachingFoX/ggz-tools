Nice little park and boat slip way in the Bayview area.

Cache is a Nano so if your not into looking for small caches that are hidden well don't attempt this one, you have been warned

The cache is reachable at all times but if you get your timing wrong you will get a bit wet. 

Was rejected on geocaching.com for being to close to another cache !</groundspeak:long_description>

From this location you can view what remains of the great battle of the bridge that took place in 2009.

Its amazing that the bridge still stands after being Nuked during the battle last year. As can be seen nature has reclaimed what was once a wasteland.
This cache is a very small Micro bullet with camo applied.

Once found replace the bullet correctly so the next cacher can spend time swearing and pulling their hair

North Head is a small strategic headland at the mouth of Auckland's Waitemata Harbour. Its commanding views over the Hauraki Gulf and inner harbour have made it an important lookout and defence site for centuries, first for early Maori inhabitants and later for European settlers.
North Head was one of a number of defence forts that were rapidly set up in the late 1800s to defend Auckland from a feared Russian attack. The fort was later expanded as part of Auckland's coastal defence system during World Wars I and II.

A complex of tunnels, guns, searchlights and other fortifications make this a fascinating area to explore. It is now a historic reserve managed by the Department of Conservation.
North Head (named Maungauika by Maori) is a taonga with many special places. The tangata whenua have a spiritual, cultural and historical relationship with their taonga.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">DC stands for Dominic and Conor who placed this cache. They had tonnes of energy to burn off so we ran through the walkway in the reserve between the waypoint and final, and then spent some time on the playground equipment near the final. 

 This quick easy multi takes you through a short walkway to a playground within a reserve on Hill Road. You can park at WP1 and work out the co-ordinates for the final, which will take you about 5mins to walk to.

At WP1 there is a big wooden sign. Using the letters on the sign, where A=1, B=2, C=3 etc, complete the co-ordinates below to find the final.

Final is at S41º 1T.2UV, E174º WX.0YZ

Where;
T = second letter in the first word
U = last letter in last word + 1
V = first letter in second word - 5
W = second letter in third word
X = fourth letter in third word
Y = last letter in first word - 7
Z = third letter in second word - 5

We trust you enjoy the cache, and younger cachers get to burn off some energy!

The cache is a film container with a logbook only, so you'll need to bring your own pen. Be very stealthy - this is a high human-activity area. If coming by car - there is a carpark at the published coordinates. The nearby mini golf course is open 1-4pm weekends &amp; school holidays. Extra stealth will be required during these times.

The Smiling Windmills is an artwork by Leon van den Eijkel. &quot;As a child growing up in Holland, life was exciting and full of joy; the clouds, the rain, the sea and nature played with us. Irksome wind is an adult thing. In The Smiling Windmills I recall my childhood and the joy wind gave me. I want to share it with everyone as a positive source of energy.&quot;

On your typical windy Wellington day these windmills should put on quite a display.

Please note that you must sign the logbook for each visit, otherwise your log may be deleted.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Requires walking on formed tracks. Suitable for moderate level of fitness.

Either:
 - from Silverstream Road (Crofton Downs), walk down beside the play center and find the small bridge crossing the stream. Follow the track up the hill.
 - enter via the marked entrance at Huntleigh Park (Ngaio) and find your way along the tracks.
There is no need to enter private property via either route.

Choose the correct forks in the path, generally going uphill. This cache is at ground level right beside a track. Don't loose sight of the track and become lost in your search! Be watchful of children, as the Wellington City Council sometimes sets poison bait off the tracks (although there was none nearby when this cache was placed).

Cache location: S41.15.012 E174.45.835

Cache is a 16x11x8cm clear plastic box. Initial contents: instructions, notebook, pen, hovercraft toy, mini rubber ball toy.

Be sure to carefully hide the cache again to avoid muggles.

If fitness and enthusiasm permit, continue uphill, cross the fence at the style and follow the track to the Mt Kaukau summit. From there you can descend into Johnsonville, Khandallah or Ngaio if desired.

The trade items listed on the cache page are gone and have been replaced with some cash and a pair of sunnies. The logbook had been filled in November but not logged here — muggles?

I found the cache easily enough because the park is virtually on my back door and I had a pretty good idea where to look which is just as well as with the GPS bouncing all over the place due to the poor signal under the canopy.  It might pay to expand on the clue and describe the area where the hint is located because there is heaps of hints to look in with the dodgy signal found in the bush.</groundspeak:text>

PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE OF THE PLANTS WHEN LOOKING FOR THE CACHE. STICK TO THE ALREADY MADE TRAILS

The cache is located on a green patch next to the Physics, Mathematics and School of Engineering and Computer Science buildings of VUW. The cache is a camo-painted 1L sistema plastic container. Please make sure you hide it super well to keep it a little challenging. Initial contents are:
- Logbook
- Pencils
- Pencil sharpner
- Super expanding insect
- Mini hand clapper

Placed partially because there was no cache at VUW and partially to make people aware of the importance (and I think coolness) of science degrees. If you visit this GC during the working day and VUW is open, have a wonder through the corridors and look at some of the research that is going on there.


FTF goes to agcnz. Congratulations!
