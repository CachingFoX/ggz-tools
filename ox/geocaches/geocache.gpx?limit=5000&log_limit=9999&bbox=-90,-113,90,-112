restroom, get something to eat, maybe even buy a souvenir. Cheap
camping, too, but there isn't much shade to speak of.&lt;br/&gt;

It is that time of year for us..... (this only applys in the late
fall).&lt;br/&gt;
We make our annual trek down the East Fork Road to hunt for the
Perfect Christmas Tree. Where do we go, how far can we make
it?&lt;br/&gt;
It really depends on the SNOW!&lt;br/&gt;
Some years we only make it just a little further South. Other years
we might not even make it to Tropic Res. But on a dry year we can
make it passed Podunk (GC17JFN).&lt;br/&gt;
And what kinda tree?&lt;br/&gt;
We look at the Bluest Spruce, watch out for those SHARP NEEDLES or
the softest friendliest Fir or think we might try a
Ponderosa?&lt;br/&gt;
If you happen to come by in the Christmas Tree Hunting Season, we
hope you find your favorite.</groundspeak:long_description>

Wonderful 1 1/2 mile round trip trail to see a spectacular
arch.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is an ammo can, but the real treasure is in seeing this
arch.&lt;br/&gt;
We were out in this area in fall of 2008 hunting
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b0caa2a1-cc4b-49ab-9d26-1fe86f9d927d&amp;amp;log=y&amp;amp;decrypt=&quot;&gt;
Turkey Running Forest cache&lt;/a&gt; when we read the online log of
catchapig. They had come to the area and stopped to hike a little
trail on their way to the cache. Well, they would've loved to place
a cache along the trail, but not being local stated such. We
decided that the trail needed to be hiked as well and so we took a
cache along. catchapig was right, it is a wonderful spot and the
hike isn't too bad, so we placed a cache. (how was that for a long
story.)&lt;br/&gt;
So thanks for the heads up on a great hidden treasure in our own
neck of the woods. &lt;br/&gt;
The trail is only 3/4 miles in.... 1 1/2 round trip and you will
climb about 400 feet. Watch the little ones on some switchbacks,
but our little ones made it fine. To access the cache, stay on the
trail, it widens when you see the arch. You will need to change a
little elevation so watch your footing when retrieving the cache.
&lt;br/&gt;
If you are adventurous, you can continue to follow a trail that
takes you to the other side of the arch with some great view of
Tropic Reservoir.</groundspeak:long_description>

We call this the Golden Dreams Cache because you are dreaming if
this cache is the only reason you are out in the area. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache is located near the fork of the Golden Wall and Castle
Bridge Trails. The Castle Bridge trail is the best trail out here!
so make sure you hike it. The Golden Wall trail is spectacular in
places, especially at the TOP where the trails meets the power
lines, here you will see its namesake. &lt;br/&gt;
The trail starts just across the road from the Red Canyon Visitor
Center. If you choose to hike the full loop, you will pass the
Buckhorn trail
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c930224b-f86d-45ec-8e6e-49517b55fc06&quot;&gt;
cache&lt;/a&gt; and end at the Red Canyon Campground.&lt;br/&gt;
The trail is moderate hiking along the Golden Wall trail to the
cache site, a bit more strenuous after that. The Castle Bridge
Trail can be a little strenuous in places depending on which way
you hike it. The cache, which is an ammo can is placed about one
mile in.&lt;br/&gt;


 
 

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/dixie/recreation/redcanyon/trails.shtml&quot;&gt;
Hiking distance/times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Golden Wall-3 miles one way - you will climb about 720 feet at the
highest.&lt;br/&gt;
Castle Bridge - 1/2 mile (plus a 1/2 mile to the trail fork), with
an elevation gain of about 500 feet.&lt;br/&gt;
Buckhorn - about 1 mile from the end to the campground, descending
about 600 feet, if you start at the visitor center.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;
 We started hiking from the Visitor Center, followed the
Golden Wall Trail to cache site, hiked
the Castle Bridge Trail (one way) then
continued on the Golden Wall Trail. We
then met up with the Buckhorn Trail,
found that cache, and finished at the Campground. Our miles were
5.2.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lost Eden&lt;/a&gt; Cache)
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
Check the additional waypoints for help in navigating the trail.
Trail starts out at about 7000 feet elevation, tops out at 7900
feet and then desend to about 7500 feet elevation at the cache
site. The trail is easy to follow at first, then watch for the
orange tape markers, then just follow the ridge (using waypoints)
to a ravine that leads into Benson Creek. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From here you can turn around and hike back out (it is roughly 1
3/4 miles one way) or bring your rope, beeners and harness and
desend the four waterfalls. The first fall is about 100 feet and
the longest.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Don't forget to enjoy the views on your way in and out, it sure is
pristine country.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is a slot canyon with FOUR separate rappels over small
waterfalls. The cache is placed between number 3 and 4. The 4th
rappel is over the &quot;Hidden Haven Falls&quot;. Since it is a slot canyon,
the coords are about 70+/- feet off. &lt;br/&gt;
Cache is an ammo can, hidden at the base of a large pine tree about
15 feet up from the trail, and about 30-40 feet from the 4th
fall.&lt;br/&gt;

Benson Creek Cache&lt;/a&gt; for the starting point of the rappels.&lt;br/&gt;
 You will have to scramble up the hill to get to the tree, but
really, what is a short scramble when you have hiked up to the top

them every chance we got. The Jules have gotten into it too, and
every disk we see, they insist mom take a picture of it (after
letting us all know THEY found it). There is an excitment about
finding a bit of history just laying around. An excitment that the
Jules don't display when finding a Micro.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Just think about the great things in Benchmark Hunting! &lt;br/&gt;
1. Benchmarks are everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;
2. You don't have to maintain them.&lt;br/&gt;
3. You don't have to worry about being Stealthy or watched by
&quot;muggles&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
 4. You don't have to fight with the NANO lids and logs.&lt;br/&gt;
5. They are treasures in history. &lt;br/&gt;
6. and it is just fun!
&lt;p&gt;So why not look for them! I know, they don't count in your FOUND
caches, so only if you are INSANE enough to gather every cache in
the area plus, and watch those numbers, you are missing out.&lt;br/&gt;
Here is a Benchmark that we have briefly looked for and never
found. It makes you wonder if it could possibly be around, after
all it was in 1931!!! back in the days before I-15.&lt;br/&gt;
As we were stumbly around with the wrong coords for a cache, we
STUMBLED upon this mark! It is only 4/10 of a mile off the listed
coords, but we did FIND it!&lt;br/&gt;
Now you have it easy, you can log the cache and the mark at one
stop, and you don't have to go 4/10 out of your way to do it.&lt;br/&gt;
May this be one of many Benchmarks you find along your Treasure
Hunting journey!&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great area to take in the sites of Panguitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are able to see much of the valley from up here, you can
even see the cliffs at Red Canyon. Take some time and enjoy the
view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Wheel drive isn't needed on the dirt road, but we are not
sure if you would take your family sedan up it, we might. However,
it isn't that far of a walk to the cache site if you choose to not
drive the dirt road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to enjoy the View&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

THANKS.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;IGTWITY gave me this container and told me to use it as a cache
at work. I try to do what I'm told (in my own way, of course), so
here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since where I work -week in week out- is surrounded my many
other caches, I chose to place this cache where I worked growing
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing original about the hide, the container is unique, and
the owners know about it and are WATCHING
YOU!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;We have wanted to place a cache here for sometime, mainly
because of the name of the place and the name of local (so to
speak) cachers that we have enjoyed finding their caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this little cache is well consealed so as not to
attract nearby attention, however we placed this the night of a
Bull ride and went un-noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

Dus met al die FTF streverkes hier in de buurt maar lekker thuis gebleven tot 22.00u.
Nog steeds was deze nog niet gelogd dus ben ik ook maar is voor een keertje de FTF jager gaan uithangen.
Tags werden allemaal vlot gevonden maar ik had de verkeerde woord wardes genomen dus :bad:
Eens naar Rit gebeld want die was ik onderweg tegen gekomen en al snel bleek dat ik volledig verkeerd bezig was.
Ook Peter kwam ik nog tegen zodat we dan maar samen naar de cache gestapt zijn om later er nog een apres van te maken aan mijn busje waar nog een flesje gekraakt werd met zen allen.

This cache was placed on the Forth of July. We were out caching in celebration of our country's birthday.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The cache location looked a little lonely and I thought it needed some visitors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I had three of my kids with me. We parked in the median of Sweetwater Road (which can be busy at times) and took the short hike to where the cache is placed.

There was a fire here in the Fall of 2010.  I wasn't able to check on this before the snow came.  I might have a chance in the next couple of weekends to go check on the cache.  It was an ammo can, so I think the container might be ok.  But, the contents may be melted. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If any of you get there before I do, please let me know how good of shape the cache is in.</groundspeak:long_description>

Boulders&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is hidden at a small neighborhood playground.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small container and is suitable for really small
trades. You can see lots of boulders from where the cache is
hidden. You do not have to search through the boulders. Park off
the main road near the playground. The road by the cache is real
busy at times. There is a cell phone tower nearby so this may throw
your accuracy off a bit.&lt;br/&gt;
Please be stealthy and make sure the cache lid is &quot;snapped&quot; all the
way closed, then replace the cache exactly as you found it. -
THANKS&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As always - Be respectful of the area and trade fair.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I ride my bike along this trail all the time and wonder why the

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This should be a pretty quick cache to find. You are looking for a
small container with just a log. You will need to bring something
to write with. Tweezers would also be handy. The cache is above eye
level and a small reach may be needed. Please make sure to place
the container back to where it is secured when you're finished.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The road is not too busy, but the vehicles do move pretty fast, so
please be careful.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As always please respect the area. You will not have to cross any
fences to find this cache. If you are at the fence you have gone
too far from the roadside.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is not at posted coordinates!
Solving the above puzzle will reveal a clue to another location. The find is within twenty feet of the clue.  The clue is in plain sight and is something you will need your geo senses to detect. NOTE: THIS IS A LEVEL 5 difficulty for a reason! It is a challenge to find this cache. You are welcome to log a find on this one if you stumble across it, but where is the fun in that?
So solve the puzzle and go find the QACHE!!!

If you solve the puzzle without finding the cache please post it as a note but not a find. 
Do not post the answer to the puzzle on this page or tell it to anyone. That will ruin all the fun!
Remember my payment for placing this hide is your log entry so please write something more than TFTCSL. 


Please trade fairly.


This geocahe is an ammo box with swag treasure for trading and an ink stamp, stamp book, and an inkpad for the letterboxers. Please leave this stuff in the cache, It is not for trading.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If this puzzle has you all scrambled and jumbled up here is a hint:

Part of this puzzle also UNCOILS BAR.

There are a few general hints on the page somewhere too. 

And I am helping the DNF-ers out so email your questions and I will answer with more riddles. Good times! If you do solve the puzzle I will tell you so.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I don't really like micro caches but while looking for my next hide this one seemed pretty cool. Let me know if you feel if the rating is appropriate for this hide. Some of you need &quot;Q&quot; caches so I named it to blatantly get more people looking for it. ;) Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

This Puzzle cache will require that you are familiar with some of your GPSr's basic functions. You begin with the coordinates for the first waypoint. Here, you'll find a container with four sets of coordinates; none of which are the set of coordinates to the final cache. You will also find information as to how these four sets of coordinates relate to each other and with that information, you should be able to determine the location of the the final cache container.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
Hard-packed dirt trail with some rock outcroppings. Bushwhacking is not necessary.

&lt;b&gt;The Containers --&lt;/b&gt;
35mm film canisters.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;

This is an opencaching.com &quot;Awareness&quot; Cache. The purpose of this cache is to raise awareness of a serious concern that people suffer from, or have survived through.

Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in the tissues of the breast. Over the course of a lifetime, 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. 

&lt;b&gt;Some Statistics:&lt;/b&gt;
•About 39,840 women in the U.S. were expected to die in 2010 from breast cancer, though death rates have been decreasing since 1990. These decreases are thought to be the result of treatment advances, earlier detection through screening, and increased awareness.

•Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S. women. For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are second only to lung cancer. More than 1 in 4 cancers in women (about 28%) are breast cancer.

•In 2010, there were more than 2.5 million breast cancer survivors in the U.S.

•The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are gender (being a woman) and age (Most advanced breast cancer cases are found in women over age 50).

&lt;b&gt;Other Risk Factors:&lt;/b&gt;
•Family history of breast cancer -- You may also have a higher risk for breast cancer if you have a close relative who has had breast, uterine, ovarian, or colon cancer. About 20 - 30% of women with breast cancer have a family history of the disease.

•Genes -- Some people have genes that make them more likely to develop breast cancer. The most common gene defects are found in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These genes normally produce proteins that protect you from cancer. If a parent passes you a defective gene, you have an increased risk for breast cancer. Women with one of these defects have up to an 80% chance of getting breast cancer sometime during their life.

•Menstrual cycle -- Women who got their periods early (before age 12) or went through menopause late (after age 55) have an increased risk for breast cancer.

&lt;b&gt;Treatment:&lt;/b&gt;
In general, cancer treatments may include:
- Chemotherapy medicines to kill cancer cells
- Radiation therapy to destroy cancerous tissue
- Surgery to remove cancerous tissue -- a lumpectomy removes the breast lump; mastectomy removes all or part of the breast and possible nearby structures.

Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (curing). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer.

&lt;b&gt;Prevention:&lt;/b&gt;
While there are no known methods of preventing cancer, new, improved treatments are helping persons with breast cancer live longer than ever before. The greatest factor in helping to catch breast cancer in its early stages, however, is with diligent exams, a diet of cancer fighting foods (whole grains instead of refined grain products, vegetables and fruits), limited consumption of alcohol and an overall healthy lifestyle.

Mt. Helena stands like a sentry over the City of Helena; it is the most popular city park for a reason. The trails the mountain provides for hikers are utilized year-round by many of the locals, and is a favorite destination for visitors. There are numerous routes which can be taken that will get you to the summit, but it's all uphill, and the mountain doesn't care.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
It's all uphill on hard-packed dirt trails with some rock outcroppings.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
Small, round metal container.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;
- This is an opencaching.com only listing.
- Dogs are allowed, however, they must remain under control and owners are responsible for packing out any waste.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Background --&lt;/b&gt;
Helena is best understood by knowing a bit about its history. Like many other towns in Montana, Helena started out as a mining town. 

One day in the early 1860's, four men, rather desperate after searching throughout western Montana for gold and finding nothing, stumbled into the area that is now known as Helena. That evening, these men decided to take one last chance in mining the nearby creek. As luck and fate would have it, the men found gold and they named the stream, appropriately enough, Last Chance Gulch.

Word soon got out about the gold strike and, seemingly overnight, the small camp became a boom town. Like all mining towns, the gold soon ran out of Last Chance Gulch, and by 1883, Helena's mining history came to an end. Yet the town continued to prosper, eventually even becoming the state capitol in 1894.

&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Stages --&lt;/b&gt;
This Multi cache will take the visitor back into Helena's mining history. It begins near the exact location the four men first found their gold, and continues &quot;upstream&quot;, along Last Chance Gulch, through the historical district which the miner's lived, and eventually winds its way up into the nearby hills, where the last of Helena's gold was once mined. 

Start at the posted coordinates and begin traveling south. Along the way, look for eight upright granite markers with bronze plaques attached. These markers are set at the actual locations of mining claims that were once worked along Last Chance Gulch. Today they will provide you with a brief history lesson, as well as the answers needed to calculate the final coordinates.

&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Clues --&lt;/b&gt;
The number of letters in the &quot;parentheses&quot; = A

The year four miners attempted one last chance to find gold = BCDE

The number of different countries people migrated from that created a &quot;true melting pot&quot; in Helena = F

The distance, in miles, that the haul from Fort Benton to Helena was along the Mullan Road = GHI

To the nearest whole dollar (rounding up), the average worth of an ounce of gold dust in 1890= JK

The day in July 1902, that Montana's capitol building, capped with its huge copper dome, was dedicated = L

Prior to 1874, the number of times the entire town of Helena nearly burned down = M

The maximum depth, in feet, that the pool at the Broadwater Resort was = NO

N 46 H A.(G-J) (A-O) (L+N)
W 112 (C-K) (F-E).L (D+M) I

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
The stroll to gather all the information is about a .25 mile stretch, and is accessible year-round. The hike to the final coordinates is a moderate hike and may not be suitable for young children or people unaccustomed to hiking; it is approximately 1 mile. Please be careful when crossing Broadway and Park Ave and stay on the established trail until you are within 50 feet of the final coordinates.

Enjoy the view of the entire Gulch from this location.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
A small, round container; accessible during all seasons.

The Ambrose Trail was established in memory of Stephen E. Ambrose, resident of Helena, Montana and author of books such as &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; and &quot;Citizen Soldier.&quot; He was also the executive producer for the HBO mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; and military advisor for the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; 

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
This trail mostly contours the north side of Mt. Helena, and offers some of the more forgiving hiking in the area, while providing wonderful views of the Helena Valley. It is a hard-packed dirt trail.

The nearest access point is the Panhandle trailhead located at LeGrande Cannon Dr and Reber Dr (N46 35.875 W112 04.156).

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
A small, round container; accessible during all seasons; requires very little off-trail travel.

The Kessler Brewing Company operated from 1865 to 1958. It was founded by Luxembourg-born Nickolas Kessler, an entrepreneur who had turned from gold prospecting to trade and manufacturing.

Kessler soon started a brickyard near the brewery, and in this way helped to build the city of Helena. By all accounts, Kessler was an exceptionally friendly and honest man, and his death was widely mourned.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
Flat and level paved parking lot.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
Black, magnetic nano.

On my way down I decided I should find a spot to place the cache.  Park at the Norris Trail head, not the first one, drive to the end of the road and park at the second trail head parking area.  The cache is a short hike up the trail.  If cars are in the trail head parking area watch out for small U.F.O.s flying through the trees as this is a popular Disk Golf area.  The cache is beyond the area used by the Disk Golfers so muggles should not be a problem.  The cache is a small plastic container containing several trade items located near the trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is nothing easy about this cache. It requires a moderate to strenous hike through the northern canyons of the Scratchgravel Hills; sometimes referred to as 'The Devil's Playground', covered with sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and home to rattlesnakes, mountain lions, and other creatures of unfriendly dispositions.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
Access is gained from Head Lane. Park at the established trailhead (N 46 40.085 W 112 05.697). Do NOT drive beyond this point - it is prohibited by BLM and is against the law.

Plan for the hike to take between 1.5-2 hours; it is 3-miles/5km round-trip. There are plenty of steep descents and accents, as well as cross-country bushwhacking through sagebrush, cactus and loose rock.
 
&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
A small, round metal container.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt; 
- This cache is accessible year-round, however, winter travel may required snowshoes or cross-country skis, while summer travel requries travelling with plenty of water.
- Dogs are allowed in this area, but not recommended because of the large quantities of prickly pear cactus.        </groundspeak:long_description>

Looking around I notice that this location contained small ferns growing on small ledges in the Mud Stone, so this area must get more water than the surrounding area, as I have not seen any other ferns growing in the Scratch Gravels.  Since I had a cache ready to go in my pack, I decided this was an interesting place for a cache.  Watch out for prickly pear cactus while hiking out to the location.  </groundspeak:long_description>

A short trek above the Blackfoot Waterfowl Production Area. The Blackfoot WPA provides a key migration route for large mammals like elk, mule deer, white-tail deer, black bears and grizzly bears. The ponds are home to cinnamon teal, canvasbacks, and many other waterfowl. It also plays home to migrating sandhill cranes.

Before Captain Lewis travelled through this valley in 1806, it had been used for thousands of years before by Native people as a corridor between the Rocky Mountain region and the prairies of central Montana. The people followed the river and creeks below upstream until they crossed the Contenintal Divide and dropped back down on the east slope towards the vast bison herds.

While the ancient trail is now only partially visible in certain locations, the entire area can be seen from this newly established overlook.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
There is parking at the trailhead (N46 57.933 W112 58.177), located on the north side of Hwy 200, approximately 18 miles west of Lincoln.

The established trail follows a shallow gulley east; at N46 57.915 W112 57.735 turn south and follow the treeline out to the Overlook sign. Bushwacking is not advised, not only for environmental preservation, but also because of all the knapweed and fallen timber.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
A small, square lock-n-lock container painted olive drab green.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;
- Black and grizzly bears are in the area. DO NOT HIKE ALONE! 
- This is an opencaching.com only listed cache. </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is a small camo'ed container containing a log book, pencil and a few small trade items.  Some folk enjoy walking around places like this, and some folk just get &quot;spooked&quot; at the idea.

Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>
