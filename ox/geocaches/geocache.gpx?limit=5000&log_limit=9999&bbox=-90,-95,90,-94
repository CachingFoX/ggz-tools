is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or pan-pipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
BaytownBert wooden nickel geocoin in the palm of your left hand, or
the Goatman will go into a whirling dervish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman has
moves Chuck Norris envies&quot;. Chuck's actual quote was &quot;He has moves
I envy&quot;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Nebulus703 for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have
an old Alice Cooper album with you, for an offering to the
Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman
looks a bit like Alice Cooper, only with more hair, bad odor, and
larger appetite, but you'll have to find that out for yourself&quot; -
if you dare!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Nebulus703 for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
photo of Robocop (Capt. David Alford) in your hand to frighten away
the Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman
takes extra pleasure in jumping real tall Exxon employees and
anyone who &quot;shoots or stuffs animals
friends&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Latitude_Attitude for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
photo of Katy Perry on your shirt to distract the
Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman is
real fond of the Scouting programs. He says they are &quot;delicious
with mustard&quot; (or so they say).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Latitude_Attitude for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
CD of Hip-Hop music in your hoopty to destroy the ears of the
Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman is
real and one little gal from Pasadena swears she dated him in the
&quot;70's&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Latitude_Attitude for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Holy crap.  That was my impression when I found it.  And we owe our find to Texas Pulltab.  He ran the route before me, and came back to avoid a DNF.  We gave up after a while.  Spend a long time looking where our GPSrs had us, but expanded GZ.  Found a pencil -- a CLUE -- on the ground.  But was still too blind to see it.  So we did #4 and #5, and Chris was nice enough to tell us he found it and to look RIGHT where I found the pencil.  Sure enough, we swung back and made the find.  Then spent 5 min trying to open it.  Then Syd.  Then the duh moment.  SL and and replaced it with the pencil.  [;)].  This one blended extraordinarily well, but mentally it just shouldn't have.  Well done.  #2,079.</groundspeak:text>

is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
photo of Hillary Clinton in your hand to scare the begeebers out of
the Goatman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman is
an upright creature, with a large balding pate, hairy body,
protruding gut, cloven hoofs, and walks bent over, but other than
that, looks like he could live in
Channelview.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to HoustonControl for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
photo of David Hasselhoff in your hand for extra powerful
handsomeness and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman has
been known to eat 14 Big Mac hamburgers in one sitting and this may
have contributed to his
uniqueness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to HoustonControl for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

he may still want to grab one of those women from Liberty
County.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and you are
encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by yourself)
and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache container in the
photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have
Bo Staff skills like Napolean Dynamite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman has
been known to cut Jeeping cachers some slack and often can be seen
bumping his horns on Jeep tires while cachers are raiding one of
his caches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to HoustonControl for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or talk
real loud like Rosie O'Donnell to confuse the Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman is a
major fan of the movie &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and likes to be called
&quot;The Dude&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to HoustonControl for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, it was a guy riding a bike, hopping off here and there to collect golf balls.  I bet he doesn't do that at NIGHT!  #2,087.</groundspeak:text>

this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or have a
photo of Mayor Stephen DonCarlos in your hands to negotiate a tax
break for the Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman goes
completely monster-like when he sees people littering his
territory, so please practice CITO, to ease his
pain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Nebulus703 for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. &lt;b&gt;Parking is on
the side of the road (no shoulder) and will have standing water
after a rain, so be careful.&lt;/b&gt; Thank you and happy
geocaching!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil and a couple goodies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This
series is dedicated to all children (and their parents), but
especially the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Rachel Nicole Hillier&lt;/b&gt;. She has
Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome. Children born with this rare genetic defect
will most likely require ongoing support from a team of parents,
therapists, and medical and educational professionals to help the
child achieve his or her maximum potential. Her father,
&lt;b&gt;Latitude_Attitude&lt;/b&gt; is an avid geocacher and brings all of his
children geocaching whenever it is possible. Both children and
adults with this syndrome are usually friendly and happy, and enjoy
social interaction. With early and consistent educational
intervention, as well as physical and language therapy, children
with 5p- Syndrome are capable of reaching their fullest potential
and can lead full and meaningful lives.&lt;/p&gt;

This series is a &quot;Park and Hunt&quot; series aimed at Family caching and
you are encouraged to take a photograph with your kiddos (or by
yourself) and upload it here. It's okay to include the cache
container in the photograph also.&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a series of caches on
Evergreen and Tri-City Beach Roads - the oldest and scariest places
in Baytown. Rumors of darkness surround this series and it is
definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Don't be embarrassed if you
remember the hair on your neck standing up when on this lonely
stretch of backwoods...or panpipe music. Last warning! Do NOT do
this series at night - unless you are absolutely fearless or
wearing a mullet wig - the Chupacabra guarding this cache will
think you are Billy Ray Cyrus and let you pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please post your own scary photos taken while caching
the series on each cache page! Don't be
skeered!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goatman Fact: Eyeball witnesses swear the Goatman has
been known to hide behind a tree and make flatulent sounds to
perplex and offend young cachers and their
parents.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
Confederate Shipyard of Goose Creek, The Bayland Guards, and the
Bayland Orphanage historical markers are all located at Bayland
Park, in beautiful Baytown, Texas. According to Trevia Beverly of
the Harris County Historical Commission, it is very rare to have so
much history and three markers in one place. Feel free to post a
photo of yourself in front of the markers for extra caching
mojo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Nebulus703 for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log
only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. Thank you and
happy geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jean Lafitte (ca. 1776
– ca. 1823)&lt;/b&gt; was a pirate and privateer in the Gulf of
Mexico in the early 19th century. He and his elder brother, Pierre,
spelled their last name Laffite, but English-language documents of
the time used &quot;Lafitte,&quot; and this is the commonly seen spelling in
the United States, including for places named for him. Lafitte is
believed to have been born either in France or the French colony of
Saint-Domingue. By 1805, he operated a warehouse in New Orleans to
help disperse the goods smuggled by his brother Pierre Lafitte.
After the United States government passed the Embargo Act of 1807,
the Lafittes moved their operations to an island in Barataria Bay.
By 1810, their new port was very successful; the Lafittes pursued a
successful smuggling operation and also started to engage in
piracy. Though Lafitte tried to warn of a British attack, the
American authorities invaded Barataria in 1814 and captured most of
Lafitte's fleet. In return for a pardon, Lafitte helped General
Andrew Jackson defend New Orleans against the British in 1815. The
Lafittes then became spies for the Spanish and moved to Galveston
Island where they developed the colony there. Lafitte continued
pirating around Central American ports until he died trying to
capture Spanish vessels in 1823. Speculation around his death and
life continue amongst historians.&lt;/p&gt;

R1 and I trekked to GZ and remarked about the nice old tree, and how sad it was that someone would tag it like that.  As we walked around, I spied a medium sized hornets nest in the lower-hanging branches.  All of them were on the TOP of the nest, huddled together because they were cold.  Went to grab the cache and found a large rock.  Hmmm. Time to freak out R1.  So after SL and replacing, I threw the rock near the hornets (couldn't have it them if I wanted to or I'd play baseball for a living).  She ran and ran.  I caught up to her and pretended I got stung.  She freaked.  Muhahaha.  Good to keep her juices flowing.  To make up, she got to play in the park for a bit.  Photos posted on her log.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Baytown Berts Goose Creek Trail - BRAWNDO Endurance Series This
is BRAWNDO ONE. Video your adventure and send BB the youtube
link!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning
point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the
smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now
began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite
direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not
necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin
the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most,
and left the intelligent to become an endangered species. The years
passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had
high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in
evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused
on one thing and one thing only…GEOCACHING. Thus was born the
BRAWNDO Endurance series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this off the trail series, you can expect heavy brush,
thorns, spider webs, and poison ivy in abundance. Don’t
expect to walk down a trail to any of the caches in this series.
Bring a walking or probing stick or risk your phalanges! Bring
water w/electrolytes, if you attempt the entire series in the
hotter month’s high heat and humidity.&lt;br/&gt;
There may be reptiles (watch your step), mossies, chiggers
(redbugs) and ticks, so bring the extra-strong bug juice. Area is
not a normal place folks hiking the Goose Creek Trail visit and
there may be old barbed wire in these woods. It may be very muddy
with water standing after a rain also.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Watch for the Cottonmouth Water Moccasin, the Copperhead, and the
Coral Snake and give them wide berth. There is heavy POISON IVY
everywhere in this wooded area! In the event you are exposed to PI,
wash ASAP with soap and then rub the inside of a banana peel on the
bumps for instant relief. Then eat the banana to help replace
electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is intended to provide cachers with a bush-whacking
adventure with the potential to score a bunch of smileys without
having to drive to Timbuktu, Bootiebump, Egypt, or
Channelview… and will satisfy your macho-adventurous nature
with a possibly physically taxing exposure to the great outdoors
– Baytown, Texas style.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Parking is available at: N29 43.888 W094 59.454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: You may want to walk the perimeter and knock off the
caches one by one, but the multiple on the inside is like a trip to
Borneo, or the Congo, or Arkansas, except there are no cheetahs,
monkeys, or trailer parks there. In other words, “it
ain’t easy to get to”.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please enjoy the hike and leave as little trace of your passing as
possible to preserve the dense under-brush and keep the series
tough and rough and a challenge for future cachers. Good luck
– you are going to need it and don’t forget to bring
extra electrolytes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to WTT-B2 for FTF! Congrats to
HoustonControl &amp; AaronBarbee for being first to complete the
entire series! (It only took them 4 months! LOL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Baytown Berts Goose Creek Trail - BRAWNDO Endurance Series. This
is BRAWNDO Nine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the
smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now
began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite
direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not
necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin
the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most,
and left the intelligent to become an endangered species. The years
passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had
high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in
evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused
on one thing and one thing only…GEOCACHING. Thus was born the
BRAWNDO Endurance series!
&lt;p&gt;In this off the trail series, you can expect heavy brush,
thorns, spider webs, and poison ivy in abundance. Don’t
expect to walk down a trail to any of the caches in this series.
Bring a walking or probing stick or risk your phalanges! Bring
water w/electrolytes, if you attempt the entire series in the
hotter month’s high heat and humidity.&lt;br/&gt;
There may be reptiles (watch your step), mossies, chiggers
(redbugs) and ticks, so bring the extra-strong bug juice. Area is
not a normal place folks hiking the Goose Creek Trail visit and
there may be old barbed wire in these woods. It may be very muddy
with water standing after a rain also.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Watch for the Cottonmouth Water Moccasin, the Copperhead, and the
Coral Snake and give them wide berth. There is heavy POISON IVY
everywhere in this wooded area! In the event you are exposed to PI,
wash ASAP with soap and then rub the inside of a banana peel on the
bumps for instant relief. Then eat the banana to help replace
electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is intended to provide cachers with a bush-whacking
adventure with the potential to score a bunch of smileys without
having to drive to Timbuktu, Bootiebump, Egypt, or
Channelview… and will satisfy your macho-adventurous nature
with a possibly physically taxing exposure to the great outdoors
– Baytown, Texas style.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Parking is available at: N29 43.888 W094 59.454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You may want to walk the perimeter and knock off the
caches one by one, but the multiple on the inside is like a trip to
Borneo, or the Congo, or Arkansas, except there are no cheetahs,
monkeys, or trailer parks there. In other words, “it
ain’t easy to get to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the hike and leave as little trace of your passing
as possible to preserve the dense under-brush and keep the series
tough and rough and a challenge for future cachers. Good luck
– you are going to need it and don’t forget to bring
extra electrolytes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to WTT-B2 for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Baytown Berts Goose Creek Trail - BRAWNDO Endurance Series. This
is BRAWNDO Ten&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the
smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now
began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite
direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not
necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin
the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most,
and left the intelligent to become an endangered species. The years
passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had
high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in
evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused
on one thing and one thing only…GEOCACHING. Thus was born the
BRAWNDO Endurance series!
&lt;p&gt;In this off the trail series, you can expect heavy brush,
thorns, spider webs, and poison ivy in abundance. Don’t
expect to walk down a trail to any of the caches in this series.
Bring a walking or probing stick or risk your phalanges! Bring
water w/electrolytes, if you attempt the entire series in the
hotter month’s high heat and humidity.&lt;br/&gt;
There may be reptiles (watch your step), mossies, chiggers
(redbugs) and ticks, so bring the extra-strong bug juice. Area is
not a normal place folks hiking the Goose Creek Trail visit and
there may be old barbed wire in these woods. It may be very muddy
with water standing after a rain also.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Watch for the Cottonmouth Water Moccasin, the Copperhead, and the
Coral Snake and give them wide berth. There is heavy POISON IVY
everywhere in this wooded area! In the event you are exposed to PI,
wash ASAP with soap and then rub the inside of a banana peel on the
bumps for instant relief. Then eat the banana to help replace
electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is intended to provide cachers with a bush-whacking
adventure with the potential to score a bunch of smileys without
having to drive to Timbuktu, Bootiebump, Egypt, or
Channelview… and will satisfy your macho-adventurous nature
with a possibly physically taxing exposure to the great outdoors
– Baytown, Texas style.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Parking is available at: N29 43.888 W094 59.454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You may want to walk the perimeter and knock off the
caches one by one, but the multiple on the inside is like a trip to
Borneo, or the Congo, or Arkansas, except there are no cheetahs,
monkeys, or trailer parks there. In other words, “it
ain’t easy to get to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the hike and leave as little trace of your passing
as possible to preserve the dense under-brush and keep the series
tough and rough and a challenge for future cachers. Good luck
– you are going to need it and don’t forget to bring
extra electrolytes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to edwinner281 and thacatfish for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">On the spur of the moment on the way home from work the decision in my brain was made to attempt this one again. Previous attempts kept flashing back and terrorizing me to a point I think I started sweating on this humid February day. Awww what the heck, it's February, it's Baytown how hard could it be?  Well not like the last attempt when it was in the middle of August where I remembered asking myself then &quot;It's August, It's Baytown, How hard can it be?

It actually went without much concern other than I decided to take a different route out from the final. More of a direct route according to the GPSr but afterward looking at my tracks I think I walked twice as far coming out as going in. May have had something to do with all the vines, undergrowth and downed trees LOL Great Cache BB Thanks for placing and both are in good shape and I concealed both a little better. TFTC TNLNSL

When I arrived at the parking area I could have sworn I saw thacatfish getting in a black car and another guy getting in a truck. I'll wait until about 7 cold fronts blow through before attacking this one again.

ain’t easy to get to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the hike and leave as little trace of your passing
as possible to preserve the dense under-brush and keep the series
tough and rough and a challenge for future cachers. Good luck
– you are going to need it and don’t forget to bring
extra electrolytes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Baytown Berts Goose Creek Trail - BRAWNDO Endurance Series. This
is BRAWNDO Six&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the
smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now
began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite
direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not
necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin
the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most,
and left the intelligent to become an endangered species. The years
passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had
high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in
evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused
on one thing and one thing only…GEOCACHING. Thus was born the
BRAWNDO Endurance series!
&lt;p&gt;In this off the trail series, you can expect heavy brush,
thorns, spider webs, and poison ivy in abundance. Don’t
expect to walk down a trail to any of the caches in this series.
Bring a walking or probing stick or risk your phalanges! Bring
water w/electrolytes, if you attempt the entire series in the
hotter month’s high heat and humidity.&lt;br/&gt;
There may be reptiles (watch your step), mossies, chiggers
(redbugs) and ticks, so bring the extra-strong bug juice. Area is
not a normal place folks hiking the Goose Creek Trail visit and
there may be old barbed wire in these woods. It may be very muddy
with water standing after a rain also.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Watch for the Cottonmouth Water Moccasin, the Copperhead, and the
Coral Snake and give them wide berth. There is heavy POISON IVY
everywhere in this wooded area! In the event you are exposed to PI,
wash ASAP with soap and then rub the inside of a banana peel on the
bumps for instant relief. Then eat the banana to help replace
electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is intended to provide cachers with a bush-whacking
adventure with the potential to score a bunch of smileys without
having to drive to Timbuktu, Bootiebump, Egypt, or
Channelview… and will satisfy your macho-adventurous nature
with a possibly physically taxing exposure to the great outdoors
– Baytown, Texas style.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Parking is available at: N29 43.888 W094 59.454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You may want to walk the perimeter and knock off the
caches one by one, but the multiple on the inside is like a trip to
Borneo, or the Congo, or Arkansas, except there are no cheetahs,
monkeys, or trailer parks there. In other words, “it
ain’t easy to get to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the hike and leave as little trace of your passing
as possible to preserve the dense under-brush and keep the series
tough and rough and a challenge for future cachers. Good luck
– you are going to need it and don’t forget to bring
extra electrolytes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Crane1223 for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to cross a fence of any kind, or
chop brush (remember this) - but there may be snakes (watch your
step) skeeters and ticks, so bring the bug juice. Area is a normal
place folks visit. May be slightly muddy with water standing after
a rain also. POISON IVY may be present!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Baytown Berts Goose Creek Trail - BRAWNDO Endurance Series. This
is BRAWNDO Four&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the
smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now
began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite
direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not
necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin
the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most,
and left the intelligent to become an endangered species. The years
passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had
high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in
evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused
on one thing and one thing only…GEOCACHING. Thus was born the
BRAWNDO Endurance series!
&lt;p&gt;In this off the trail series, you can expect heavy brush,
thorns, spider webs, and poison ivy in abundance. Don’t
expect to walk down a trail to any of the caches in this series.
Bring a walking or probing stick or risk your phalanges! Bring
water w/electrolytes, if you attempt the entire series in the
hotter month’s high heat and humidity.&lt;br/&gt;
There may be reptiles (watch your step), mossies, chiggers
(redbugs) and ticks, so bring the extra-strong bug juice. Area is
not a normal place folks hiking the Goose Creek Trail visit and
there may be old barbed wire in these woods. It may be very muddy
with water standing after a rain also.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Watch for the Cottonmouth Water Moccasin, the Copperhead, and the
Coral Snake and give them wide berth. There is heavy POISON IVY
everywhere in this wooded area! In the event you are exposed to PI,
wash ASAP with soap and then rub the inside of a banana peel on the
bumps for instant relief. Then eat the banana to help replace
electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is intended to provide cachers with a bush-whacking
adventure with the potential to score a bunch of smileys without
having to drive to Timbuktu, Bootiebump, Egypt, or
Channelview… and will satisfy your macho-adventurous nature
with a possibly physically taxing exposure to the great outdoors
– Baytown, Texas style.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Parking is available at: N29 43.888 W094 59.454&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You may want to walk the perimeter and knock off the
caches one by one, but the multiple on the inside is like a trip to
Borneo, or the Congo, or Arkansas, except there are no cheetahs,
monkeys, or trailer parks there. In other words, “it
ain’t easy to get to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the hike and leave as little trace of your passing
as possible to preserve the dense under-brush and keep the series
tough and rough and a challenge for future cachers. Good luck
– you are going to need it and don’t forget to bring
extra electrolytes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Crane1223 for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
location is a vacant area on Goose Creek I would like to see the
city clean up for fishing. There ain't &quot;No Trespassing signs&quot; here,
but I suggest parking a little further north and driving down off
the road. Be advised if you park on the shoulder of the road, BPD
will probably pull over to see what you are doing. Put your
flashers on if you stay on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Nebulus703 &amp; Latitude_Attitude for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - log,
pencil, and some of BB's wooden nickel geocoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a
wonderful CITO opportunity. Please pick up any trash or refuse on
your way out and do your best to re-hide the cache in the original
configuration. Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to cross a
fence of any kind, or chop brush (remember this) – most of
the year there may be skeeters and ticks, so bring the bug juice.
Area is not a normal path folk’s visit and a lot of debris
and sharp objects, so beware sandal wearers. The cache site is very
muddy with water standing all the time. Alligators have been
spotted in this area at one time and may still be here.  Feral
hogs, coyotes, and be advised - &lt;b&gt;TJ Bustem&lt;/b&gt; watched a bobcat
go into the woods here. BB's Bobcat Barkaloo is the 3rd cache in
the Barkaloo Park Series. This one is difficult to find for
seasoned veterans, so expect to find it in a non-typical
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to ATEEZY for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please

happy geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honda Hills was
Skathious' childhood playground. Nothing but bike trails and
awesome forts made by him and the old neighborhood group of buds.
He lived here practically, and threw the biggest fit whenever he
had to go home for dinner. This cache is hidden in the last
surviving part of Honda Hills. Few bike trails remain in this small
section of what used to be a favorite place in the world. Oh almost
forgot... you might just need a machete for this one. Happy caching
and good luck!!!!.&lt;/p&gt;

(keep an eye out - and use a stick to probe the cache) mossies, and
ticks, so bring the bug juice. Area is an old dumping ground with
lots of small-sized pieces of glass and metal debris, so beware
sandal wearers. May be very muddy and slippery on the uneven
terrain after a rain also, so watch your step!&lt;br/&gt;

need to cross a fence of any kind, or chop brush (remember this) -
but there may be snakes (watch your step) skeeters and ticks, so

need to cross a fence of any kind, or chop brush (remember this) -
but there may be snakes (watch your step) skeeters and ticks, so
bring the bug juice. Area is a normal place in the park folks visit
often and you may have a muggle come up seemingly out of nowhere
while you're searching. May be very muddy with water standing just
off the trail after a rain also. POISON IVY everywhere in this
park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to cross a fence of any kind, or
chop brush (remember this) - but there may be snakes (watch your
step) skeeters and ticks, so bring the bug juice. Area is a normal
place in the park folks visit and there may be people picnicking
near-by on the weekends. May be slightly muddy with water standing
after a rain also. POISON IVY everywhere in this park!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to thacatfish for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember&lt;br/&gt;
the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something, leave&lt;br/&gt;
something of equal or greater value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please pick up any
trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to re-hide the
cache in the original configuration. BB's Jenkins Park Muscadine
cache is #4 in a series of Jenkins Park Caches. Thank you and happy
geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No
disrespect meant towards the great poet John Peter Sjolander. See
the historic marker, read about him, and take a photo of yourself
at the location and post it (optional)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to GEO JPR for his first ever
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - magnetic
Nano and log only designed to bring this great man much needed
attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SJOLANDER, JOHN PETER (1851–1939)&lt;/b&gt; John Peter
Sjolander (pronounced Sholander), Swedish-American farmer-poet
known as the &quot;Sage of Cedar Bayou,&quot; was born on March 25, 1851, in
Hudiksvall, Sweden, the son of Olof and Margreta (Larsson)
Sjolander. His father, who was dismissed from naval service for
nonconformity to the state church and whose children were denied
access to the state schools, drowned when Sjolander was five years
old. He was taught English, German, and Swedish by his mother. At
the age of fifteen he went with an importer to England, where he
visited classes at Trinity College, Cambridge University, and
browsed in the library. A devotee from childhood of Walter Scott
and Robert Burns, young Sjolander made a pilgrimage to Burns's
grave, where he met an American admirer of Burns, Charles Peterson
of Peterson's Magazine, Philadelphia. Peterson offered the youth a
position if he should ever come to America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From England Sjolander went to Germany, was imprisoned
during the Franco-Prussian War, and was paroled to Copenhagen with
orders to return to Sweden. Instead he caught an English ship,
visited a sailor brother at Cardiff, Wales, and together they
signed for a voyage to Galveston, Texas, where they landed on
Sjolander's twentieth birthday. Disliking the tyrannical master,
the brothers slipped away up Cedar Bayou, where they found work in
a brickyard. From 1871 to 1876 Sjolander built boats, sailed
Galveston Bay and connecting waters, captained a lighter, and
absorbed the lore of the coast. Visiting the Philadelphia
Centennial in 1876, he took an editorial position on Peterson's
Magazine, but his heart was in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall he returned to Cedar Bayou. Sjolander married
Caroline Johanna Busch on May 23, 1878. They had six children.
Farming for a living, building an occasional boat, rearing a family
of six, and writing poetry as the spirit moved, he won many friends
and a little money as his work began to appear in publications
throughout the country, including Peterson's Magazine, the New York
Weekly, and the New Orleans Times-Democrat. He refused all requests
to write on regular assignments, declaring that his expression
&quot;must come from an inward urge.&quot; The result was a spontaneity and a
sincerity that characterize his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of his poems were translated into foreign languages.
His &quot;Song of the Corn,&quot; &quot;The Bluebonnet,&quot; and others went into
school readers. The only volume of his work in book form is Salt of
the Earth and Sea (1928), a compilation by Hilton R. Greer.
Sjolander's most prolific period was between 1876 and 1910, but he
never lost the master's touch. His poems were always offered first
to Texas publications and were usually accepted, the Galveston News
and Farm and Ranchqqveing his principal media. Their lack of
national circulation and the absence of a potent Texas literary
cult during his prime left Sjolander without the national
recognition of which his work is worthy. But he preferred the rural
life which produced &quot;The Dusk,&quot; &quot;Night Amid the Farms,&quot; &quot;The Wise
Husbandman,&quot; &quot;To a Clod,&quot; and &quot;The Little Road,&quot; which could have
never been written in a metropolitan environment, where he might
have commanded a wider audience. Sjolander died on June 15, 1939,
and was buried at Cedar Bayou. He was a Methodist, a Mason, and a
Democrat. In 1968 a historical marker was erected near the old
Sjolander home northeast of Baytown, honoring the
poet.&lt;/p&gt;

need to cross a fence of any kind, or chop brush (remember this) -
but there may be snakes (watch your step), bees, skeeters, and
ticks, so bring the bug juice. Area is not a normal place folks
visit and places for snakes to hide and slippery slopes are
present, so beware. May be very muddy with water standing after a
rain also. Bumble bees may be in this area too - read the
logs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to WTT-B2 for FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents pencil

goodies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. Thank you and
happy geocaching! This cache is also a qualifying cache for the
I-10 Interstate Highway Challenge (GC1AM16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I asked Dayton, Texas brothers Cletus and Buford to help me
identify the local critters and populace while I was out and about
placing geocaches. Buford does the talkin' and Cletus provides the
&quot;reasonin'&quot;. This is number two in the series. Thanks fellars!&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No
need to cross a fence of any kind, or chop brush (remember this) -
but there may be snakes (watch your step) skeeters and ticks, so
bring the bug juice. Area is not a normal place to
visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to WTT-B2 &amp; Wife for

remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater

&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to

happy geocaching! This cache is also a qualifying cache for the

identify the local geography and populace while I was out and about

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A grain elevator is a tower
containing a bucket elevator, which scoops up, elevates and then
uses gravity to deposit grain in a silo or other storage
facility.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need
to cross the fence, or trespass - but there may be skeeters,
chiggers, and ticks, so bring the bug juice. Please take a photo of
yourself with the elevator in the background and post it here
(optional). Road is under construction, so please be careful and
keep an eye on the kiddos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to &lt;b&gt;thacatfish&lt;/b&gt; for
FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please
remember the golden rule of geocaching - if you take something,
leave something of equal or greater
value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Original contents - Small

&lt;p&gt;Please
pick up any trash or refuse on your way out and do your best to
re-hide the cache in the original configuration. Thank you and
happy geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

You are looking for an ammo box, hidden fairly well in the only available hiding location near these coordinates. Please be careful and stay on the trails, as there are many rare and unique plants found throughout the preserve.

Congratulations to BattChief203 for FTF!

The Watson Rare Plants Preserve (WRPP) is the lifelong work of botanist, artist and naturalist Geraldine Watson, and is named in honor of her late husband. Ms. Watson has had a multi-faceted life: growing up in the Big Thicket, learning about the flowering plants of the region; working for the National Park Service; helping found the Big Thicket Association; and, of course, purchasing and developing the tracts of land that now comprise the WRPP. Ms. Watson developed the WRPP to showcase as many varied plants, especially rare ones, in a small area that can be viewed during a short hike. In one short walk, you can see myriad plants; from the unique Jack-in-the-Pulpits and Texas Trillium of the Beech Hardwood Slopes to the carnivorous pitcher plants, sundews and orchids of the Sphagnum bogs, this is one fantastic place to visit! The WRPP is free and open to the public, and is a non-profit organization; so they operate on kind donations from visitors. If you are fortunate to catch Ms. Watson (now in her eighties) here, ask to see her paintings, litho prints, greeting cards, etc., all for sale if you wish!</groundspeak:long_description>

      Not!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is definitely
      &lt;i&gt;NOT&lt;/i&gt; an original cache idea.  The name is a
      lie.  Look in the most obvious and easy spot and you'll
      find exactly what you are expecting. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember to have fun, not
to criticize the hide. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      signs of wildlife and student life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The SFAEF (Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest) is a
   great place to stroll through the East Texas woods.  To
   learn more about this section of the Angelina National Forest,
   read the USFS statement below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw many things as I hiked in, including abandoned
student projects.  I saw beaver damage, old wood nest boxes
falling apart and and a nice creek to hike beside.  
There's lots of wildlife to be seen and heard by the quiet hiker
(that's not me, I hike with a noisy hound). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to this cache is apparently abandoned and is no
longer maintained.  As a result, it's littered with deadfall
ranging from twigs to trees and is becoming overgrown.  Some
parts are easier for short people and some parts are easier for
tall people.  When I placed the cache, I remained on the road
(and I use that term loosely) until the very end.  If it looks
like you can't get through, look more closely.  In a couple of
places the road simply became a path until I passed fallen debris
and then it opened up again.  However, this road will likely
be more difficult in the Spring and Summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a container within a container.  The
outer container is easy to open but more difficult to close. 
Please take care to close and latch it as you find it to ensure
that the contents remain secure for the next cacher. This area
floods so use your judgment if it has rained recently, you may want
to wait and let it dry out to avoid wading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Statement from the U.S. Forest
Service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its adoption
into the National Forest System in 1945, the primary objective of
the Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest (SFAEF) has been wildlife
and forest management research. As such, the site is used as an
outdoor classroom and research site by by federal and state
scientists and by students majoring in forestry, wildlife
management, forest recreation, and environmental science. Upland
portions of the forest are typically prescribed burned about every
three years, so it is suggested that you use fire-proof
caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please heed the
following requirements from the Forest Service:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.) Do NOT harm
any animals or plants! Many of the critters you may see (including
snakes) are active particpants in ongoing research studies.
Remember, they live here- we're only visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.) Do NOT tamper
with any equipment you may find in the forest, including ammo boxes
not within logical distance of cache coordinates. These ammo boxes
contain important research equipment. Plain and simple, if it's not
a cache, don't mess with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.) Please stay on
the trails (or roads) except when necessary to retrieve a cache,
and then use common sense in regards to the environment. There is
no cache hidden in the forest that should result in the destruction
of any plants, animals, or research equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.) No camping,
smoking, or fires are allowed on the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.) The trails are
only open to foot traffic and wheel chairs. Only Jack Creek Loop is
considered wheel chair accessible. No bicycles, skate boards, or
other forms of transportation are allowed on the trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.) The trails are
open during daylight hours throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these rules are
not followed, trail access (geocaching) will be jeopardized at the
SFAEF. Please do your part to ensure that geocachers are able to
enjoy the beauty of the SFA EF for years to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

This barber shop is one of the last old time barber shops that I know of in this area. My dad was a barber up until the day he past away and was the only barber that ever cut my hair, that is until I moved to San Augustine and found this quite little shop. It is a place of yesteryear when you didnt have to get your hair cut when you walked iun the door but just sit down and talk about the days events with the fellas. Shave and a haircut, two-bits, brings back memories. The cache you are looking for is a pill bottle, there is a log and a FTF Cert for the lucky person who finds it first.

 &lt;p&gt;OLD NORTH BAPTIST
   CHURCH:  Old North Baptist Church, on U.S. Highway 59 four
   miles north of the city limits of Nacogdoches, is the oldest
   active missionary Baptist church in Texas. It was originally
   called Union Baptist Church because settlers from various
   religious denominations made up the first congregation. It was
   founded by Mrs. Massey Sparks Millard, who came to Texas in 1832
   and settled north of Nacogdoches, near where the church now
   stands. She constantly prayed that a church would be established
   at the spot where she, some other women, and their children hid
   in a thicket during Indian and Mexican raids while the men tried
   to repel the raiders. Mrs. Willard arranged for Rev. Isaac Reed
   to preach to a small group of Americans at the springs just
   after the battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. These people
   decided to build a place of worship and a one-room school.
   Liberty School House was built in October 1836 of red oak logs
   spliced together because they were too short and laid on a rock
   foundation. This building was used until 1852, when a frame
   building was constructed on the same foundation. In 1882 the
   building was remodeled and painted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a meeting at Liberty
School House on Sunday, May 6, 1838, the church was officially
organized when ministers Isaac Reed and Robert G. Green preached
and invited people with church letters who wanted to constitute a
church to come forward. John and Betsy Eaton, Charles Whitaker,
Sarah Tipps, Mary Crain, Emily Knight, Ruth Anderson, and Anthony
and Chancy, the last two slaves, came forward. Charles Whitaker was
elected church clerk. Several people joined the church between May
and September 1838, during a revival started by Rev. James L.
Bryant, a teacher at Liberty School House. Twenty people were
baptized at the church in June and July; these were the first
Baptist baptisms in East Texas. Richard Sparks donated five acres
of land in 1837 or 1838 at the springs where Old North Church was
built. In 1843 the need for a general organization led to the
formation of the Sabine Baptist Association at the church with five
other churches participating. The organization was later dissolved.
John M. Sparks Richard's son, deeded and registered the land in the
names of the trustees of the church on February 29, 1892. The Old
North Church Cemetery, established in 1836 before the church was
organized, is the oldest Protestant cemetery in Nacogdoches County.
On the first Sunday of May 1923, the church began its first annual
homecoming meeting; the centennial homecoming was held on May 1,
1938, and the sesquicentennial anniversary on May 1,
1988.   (Information retrieved from Handbook of Texas
Online)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now about the cache.  This is a micro cache located
in the west cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to legend, the first burial in this
     cemetery was that of a young girl whose family, traveling
     through the area when she died, buried her here before
     continuing their westward journey.  Oral tradition also
     suggests that William Whitaker was already interred in a brick
     vault by the time Richard Sparks set aside land on this site
     for use as a community graveyard in 1838.  The Union
     Baptist Church (later the Old North Church) was organized in
     the spring of that year.  The oldest marked grave is that
     of Saletha Easter Whitaker (d. 1845).  Dr. John M. Sparks
     and his wife formally deeded ten acres including the original
     five acres set aside by Richard Sparks to the Union Church in
     1892.  The cemetery historically was divided into two
     sections.  The east side was used for the burial of local
     slaves, many of whom were members of the church, and
     eventually became a separate cemetery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other
burials of interest include those of veterans of the American
Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Texas Revolution. 
Records indicate that some forty-seven Confederate Civil War
soldiers are buried in the southern portion of the cemetery, and
twenty-one Union soldiers are interred in unmarked graves. 
Most of the Union veterans were victims of an epidemic of dysentery
during the Reconstruction Era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
Old North Church Cemetery Association was organized in 1976. 
With more than 950 graves in 1998, the graveyard continues to be
used by descendants of early church members.  The burial
ground is a chronicle of the  early days of Nacogdoches
County.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      is an important part of that.  I'd like to bring cachers
      back to the Old North Church with this cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;br/&gt;
As you drive
in, you will see a couple of stone markers and the remains of a
large Post Oak tree.  A storm in 1925 nearly destroyed the
tree when almost the entire crown was blown off.  It healed
and its injuries were hidden by a dense crown of branches and
leaves.  In September 2005, Hurricane Rita blew through and
destroyed the tree.  Today you can see the remaining stump
filled with concrete from earlier repairs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;  The cache is not too far away
      from this historic site. &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
This post oak once played an important role in the religious life
of early Texans, for it was under its spreading branches that the
settlers secretly met and worshipped.  Under Mexican rule,
religious freedom was denied those of a faith other than
Catholicism, the state religion. Consequently, until the defeat of
the Mexicans at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, Texans
of other faiths were forced to meet in secret.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As early as 1832, settlers in the Nacogdoches area met and
worshipped under this historic post oak tree, which was somewhat
removed from the settlement but which had nearby a good spring of
water.&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
In 1835, a 10-acre site around the tree was donated for use as a
graveyard and church site by Dr. John M. Sparks, son of Richard
Sparks, the last alcalde of Nacogdoches.  The first use of the
graveyard came when a child from a passing wagon train was
buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey!  What about the cache?  The cache is an
unusual container with room for only a few small trade items and
the log.  Please replace the cache as you found it so that the
next person has the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is in the historic, Perry-Clay Cemetery.

The cache owner has found that cemetery caches often are often interesting and worthwhile. Notable aspects of each cemetery vary by many factors including dates, historical information, marker attributes, names, etc.

Perry-Clay Cemetery has a few interesting burial site features including visible vaults, unique markers, etc., but the overall tone of the visit seems to be one of sadness and introspection. The cemetery seems distinctly neglected and unkempt. There seems to be a fairly large population of aluminum sign markers, various of which are damaged or unreadable. Unfinished dirt work is evident at the back of the lot, and it appears that brush cleanup was rushed and possibly was the source of some marker damage.

It seems that an unkempt cemetery has an unfortunate negative, impact on the reverence that often accompanies other sites. While walking down to the cache site, please at least make some attempt to find a reflective and respectful attitude despite the surroundings.

The cemetery seems to contain markers that go back to about 1915. There are several &quot;different&quot; markers and a few &quot;unconventional&quot; burial sites here and there. One family grouping is surrounded by a fence made of welded well rods. At another location, a steel cable lays near once site... purpose unknown.

One must venture off the beaten path to find this cache, but at the end of the search the meaning of the cache name will probably become a little more obvious. It has nothing to do with marriage, but it might provide some hint at the way life can go on in the face of uncomfortable circumstances.

A vehicle gate at the entrance remains chained most of the time, but access is possible through a walk-in gate to the left of the main gate. A sign requests that the gate remain closed, so take care to latch it after passing through.

The cache container is an army green waterproof match holder. Please take care to replace the cache carefully. Make sure that the container is not easily seen by workers or visitors.

Watch your step at ground zero. Heavy brush was cleared and little stumps still protrude from the ground here and there. Also watch out for the Smilax vines underfoot. Though they were easily avoided when the cache was hidden, they grow fast.

If you see a bit of litter, pick some up and carry it out. Every little bit counts.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A geocache hidden in the same park that used to host another named Prince Caspian.

This cache is hidden in Willow Park. The park hosts a picnic area, pavilion, play area, and has equipment to support basketball, soccer, and softball games.

The park used to host a cache named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6baf1d42-d773-4346-bf46-c2a512fced21&quot;&gt;Prince Caspian&lt;/a&gt; driven the non-human talking beasts underground and are actively campaigning to eradicate the memory of Old Narnia. Any Old-Narnian unfortunate enough to be captured is at risk of being put to death.

At the beginning of the tale, Prince Caspian himself is driven underground. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie find themselves transported into Narnia to assist in the restoration of the old order.

Prince Caspian is nowhere to be found, and the dryads have either been destroyed or have hidden themselves from view.

It is your mission to find those that have gone undercover... Who knows, you might run into Trumpkin, Trufflehunter, Patterwig, Reepicheep, or any number of other talking beasts. Steer clear of Miraz and his treacherous minions.

Just as the Pevensies ran into an Old Narnian almost immediately, you will find you need not venture deeply into this realm to find what you seek, though you may have to cross Glasswater creek.

This cache holds only a log.

Take care to retrieve and replace the cache with stealth. Use special care to replace the cache as found. Telmarines are known to loiter here for extended periods of time. It is important to avoid calling calling undue attention to the magical secrets of Narnia before epic battles are fought and won.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache within view of a Longview Fire Department Training Facility complete with a simulated train wreck.

This cache location is in Stamper Park and was located by looking for potentially viable and interesting places via a satellite map view mode. The initial draw was the sports complex labeled &quot;Lobo Stadium&quot;, but the site has a lot of other interesting locations that Longview residents should know about.

Stamper Park includes a picnic area and grill, pavilion, restrooms, baseball fields, softball fields, horseshoe pits, play area, multi-use courts, water fountains, water connection, and a splash pad.

Who would have guessed that one can also find a a train wreck adjacent to the park or that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=Longview+Fire+Department+Training+Facility&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=32.487629,-94.748803&amp;amp;sspn=0.000929,0.001808&amp;amp;vpsrc=6&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;st=112334869561858955379&amp;amp;rq=1&amp;amp;ev=zi&amp;amp;split=1&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;hq=Longview+Fire+Department+Training+Facility&amp;amp;hnear=&amp;amp;ll=32.487367,-94.748642&amp;amp;spn=0.000929,0.001808&amp;amp;z=20&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=32.487367,-94.748642&amp;amp;panoid=Me0rzS4CSSsJkSDcSGdhXA&amp;amp;cbp=12,5.7,,0,0&quot;&gt;wrecked train&lt;/a&gt; could be found 1000-1500 feet away from the nearest rail line?

Stamper Park seems to have played a significant part for Longview recreation in times past. The site includes an old, now defunct, pool facility. Here's to hoping that recent improvements to the park continue.

Whether Stamper Park shines again or not, Longview residents really should know about unique landmarks in this part of the city.

To find the cache hidden here, drive on past the splash pad and park in the area adjacent to Fair Street and the baseball field.

Stealth is a must when retrieving and replacing the cache container. It is not your average micro - it is custom-made by the owner. Let's not have it disappear due to carelessness!

This cache contains a log, pen, and can host small swag items.

While the area is quite open and likely okay for night visits, its probably not a good idea to venture here alone. Consider leaving the find for another time if there are vehicles in the lot at night. This area is generally considered a bad neighborhood, though the city has done a pretty good job of cleaning it up in the past few years. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in a city park near a historic train station that serves Amtrak's Texas Eagle passengers.

Amtrak's Longview station is east of downtown, and is a former Texas &amp; Pacific Railway passenger station. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texaseagle.com/stations/LVW.htm&quot;&gt;Site Link&lt;/a&gt;

The Longview station is purportedly the 4th busiest along the Texas Eagle route. Part of the reason is that it serves as a connecting point for motorcoach services to and from Shreveport and Bossier City, Louisiana, as well as Nacogdoches, Houston, and Galveston, Texas.

One can often observe buses parked adjacent to a play area on the west end of the station parking lot. Please do not park in the over-size spaces designated for use by the coaches.

The cache is located in the play and picnic area located right beside the entrance to the station parking lot. The play area features a climb-on locomotive along with a couple of other pieces of play equipment. Picnic tables are scattered about, and a number of Crepe Myrtle trees line the fence between the park area and the rail yard.

While you are here, see if you can see something odd about the Crepe Myrtle trees. It is pretty sad to see what irresponsibility does to living things. On the other hand, it is pretty neat to see that these trees heal so quickly.

The park area is well lit at night, with many of the Crepe Myrtles having accent lighting placed at their bases, but do please observe the posted park hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

Train enthusiasts are periodically seen about. The station is adjacent to a fairly busy switching yard.

The cache is an army green waterproof match container that contains only a log sheet.</groundspeak:long_description>

The area gets quite muddy and wet if its rained recently so wear boots.Other than that it isnt too hard of a GC to find.

My name is SPC Vermeulen and I am a Combat Engineer for the Army(i look for and clear Roadside bombs/IEDS). I live nearby and this area seemed like a good place to put my farewell or C-Ya-Later cache. I've Been in Afghanistan for a few months now and enjoy reading about the fun people have finding my cache.

There were plenty of goodies in the cache before i left, i hope people have returned the favor. I will be home soon for R&amp;R and will check on it and refill it ASAP.You're looking for a small ammo box with log and pen and multiple items...

Enjoy and have fun.Hope you get as wet and muddy as I did!

***This is my First Hide so please let me know what you think***
This cache is in a dangerous area so please no children. Snakes, stickers and cliffs are some big worries!

I was in Oklahoma on my honeymoon and took a guided fly fishing trip down this river and found/spotted the greatest place for hiding my first Geocache in an area he called Frustration Alley (because of the huge trout that you will see but never catch).

For the Terrain rating I posted, you must park by the bridge and walking along the bank of the river until it ends, and then climb upward. If you're physically fit enough. Otherwise, you will have to find your own way because that's the way I took to hide it and found some beautiful areas that you will otherwise not see.

The Geocache is a.....sorry it wont be that easy, i don't think you will have much trouble finding it though.

I consider myself pretty fit and this trek was hard for me. So please be careful, the rocks are covered with moss and the shale is like walking on ice with plastic shoes.

Just a note for those planning to take the upper route instead - a portion of this goes through private property or restricted area. The owner/caretaker - who lives on site, is very nice and quickly gave our group permission but PLEASE do stop and ASK! </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This isnt much of a hint. But i would park at the bridge and walk along the stream to cover some ground but don't go too far, the ground will get steep quick.Once you climb to the top go left. I found a game trail that led me almost directly to where i hid the Geocache</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The date the structure was built is uncertain but is said to have still been in use into the 1940s. This historic jail was restored as part of an Eagle Scout project sometime around 2008. This is a concrete structure with two cells each about 6’x10’. The jail had no plumbing, no heat, and no covering for the iron-bar windows. Even one nights stay, especially during the winter, should have been enough to reform the hardest of criminal.

There used to be even older rock jail constructed mostly underground nearby that dated back to the Civil War. If you have any additional information or stories related to this historic jail, please share. </groundspeak:long_description>

      TX

Mr. *TnT* had just arrived home from work on a
      Friday afternoon and he and Mrs. *TnT* were sharing the
      stories of their respective days. Suddenly, the phone
      rang... 
&lt;p&gt;A week later, we were in this beautiful area for
a job interview. This cache was placed near the place we stayed
that first night in NW Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF goes to Fearless Four&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For those who've done &quot;NWA - The Interview&quot; and were wondering if
we had any luck, here's the answer.

As we left the interview on Friday afternoon, we weren't sure how
it had gone. Monday morning, a phone call was received, an offer
made and later accepted. Two weeks later, our furniture was in a
moving van and we were on our way. We really like the area and
can't wait to find and place lots of caches.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a simple little cache placed very near the place we spent
our first two nights when we moved to NWA. There's no need to go
into the hotel parking lot.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You DO NOT need to go into the hotel parking area to find this
cache. Check the other side of the fence.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Bentonville and Rogers. Find a minimum of 12 of these and you’ll
have the coordinates for the Micro Madness Bonus Cache
GC1DX05.

These caches are all micro in size, ranging from bison tubes to
film canisters, to a few other odd shaped containers we had. Some
are hidden low, some high, some are hidden in between. Each of the
Micro Mania caches has written on the log sheet the letter A, B, C,
D, E, or F followed by a number (0 thru 9). &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you find these caches, you may want to record what you find,
because two of the As” have the same number, as do two of the Bs”,
two of the Cs” and so on.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The number on the two As” that are the same give you the A”
coordinates to put into the formula for the Micro Mania Bonus Cache
and so on for B, C, D, E and F. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The other caches in this series are: &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Corner Hangout &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Dance, Dance, Dance&lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Got Cash? &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Market Frenzy &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Belmont &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Where’s the Fire? &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Where’s Oscar? &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – 7-10 Split &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Hollywood or Bust &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Got Rock? &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – OliveBranch &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Keep it Clean &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Bowled Over &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Wild Goose Chase &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – 3rd Post From the End &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – NOT Captain Quick &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Got a Vacancy &lt;br/&gt;
Micro Mania – Bonus Cache &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once you’ve found your pairs, go to the Bonus Cache and follow the
instructions for the final coordinates. We hope you enjoy this
series of easy caches. &lt;br/&gt;

There's no hint in the name for this cache,
which is somewhat unusual for a *TnT* hide. Its just that as I was
approaching the spot where a planned to hide this little 'ol bison
tube, a chipmunk crossed my path. Should be pretty easy for most.
Please replace exactly as found.

We expect that some cachers won't find this

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Crawford State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching  for specific details and instructions.


Rich in history and spectacular scenery, Crawford State Park has a flavor all its own.  This southeast Kansas treasure, located 9 miles north of Girard in Crawford County, resides on a 150-acre lake built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930’s.  The park dedicated the CCC Memorial Trail in 2005 to the CCC members who built the lake.  This trail hosts a National CCC Alumni Foundation Statue and items of historical importance honoring their achievement.  There are two recorded archaeological sites within the park’s boundaries, including remnants of a 19th-century U.S. military outpost.  An interpretive trail, Deer Run Trail, connects the park with the Kansas Department of Wildlife &amp; Parks’ Farlington Fish Hatchery, which was built shortly after the CCC completed construction of the lake.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching  for complete details and instructions.

An easy cache to get with kids in tow, and some stuff inside that they'll enjoy. Easy terrain, close parking, and just a bit of a hunt for the cache.

The employees of the property for the most part know about the cache and will be eager to help, so wave them off if you don't want a spoiler!

To give another option for those who are looking for a cache fix in the area, we placed one before we left the property and hope that it stands the test of time. We will be working it every 6 months or so since we have both business and family in the area, and plan to keep it maintained.</groundspeak:long_description>

I did get up on top of John Brown Hill and it is nice view. This cache needs to be updated with a correct location.Update 6/16/2011I looked at a different geocaching website and found that coordinates are probably wrong for this site. The other site listed the coordinates as being N 38° 33.027 W 094° 55.095. I will try again and see if this works better. Also I will bring tick spay this time :-)

I was able to find the cache this time with the different coordinates. Very creative cache loctation. :-)</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Hillsdale State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Hillsdale is one of the newest reservoirs in Kansas.  Originally authorized in 1954 and completed in 1982, the reservoir is part of a comprehensive flood control plan for the Osage and Missouri River basins.  Located in the rolling hills of Miami County, Hillsdale State Park and Wildlife Area has convenient access from urban Kansas City.  Hillsdale offers outdoor recreational opportunities to campers, anglers, boaters, hunters, swimmers, horseback riders, model airplane flyers, hikers, naturalists, picnickers, photographers, sightseers, and those just out to enjoy our natural environment.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

Cedar Lake Park is a great park to visit during a lunch break or spare time. I've never seen too many people here but there are plenty of fishermen on the weekends. 

I'm not sure what time the park opens but there's a sign that states &quot;Gates Closed at 10pm&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On December 7th 2010, Garmin introduced OpenCaching.com to the geocaching community.  To commemorate the occasion, this cache was placed on the one month anniversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remarkably, 10 years prior on this date Garmin introduced itself to investors with their initial public offering on the Nasdaq market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To commemorate the date and thank the valued geocachers that support OpenCaching.com, this cache was created and filled with various OpenCaching.com swag.  As swag material is depleted, it will be replenished.  The cache is located just a little off a walking trail.  Please use the nearby parking lot and do not park along side the road when attempting this geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache also highlights the use of Garmin chirp™ for those interested.  While not required to find the cache, an extra hint is broadcast from this geocaching beacon to chirp-compatible devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed on Garmin property with permission.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was placed so that I could create a home point for a Flat Stanley travel bug. This travel bug's goal is to travel all around the country and to have people take pictures of the places that it travels to. They can send the pictures back to us at MNU and then we will create a scrapbook of where it goes. If you are the lucky person to snag our travel bug and you would like to know more about Flat Stanley, you can get more info at the travel bug's site. If you are not the lucky person to grab the travel bug, you can still take time to enjoy our wonderful campus. There are usually lots of students walking around during the daytime so you will have to be sneaky. </groundspeak:long_description>

Indian Creek Trail.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;General Information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the whole Indian Creek Trail is beautiful the cache area
is extraordinary. On the morning I placed the cache, January 13,
2011, there was 6 inches of snow on the ground and it was 5 degrees
fahrenheit out. The creek was steaming, there were white-tailed
deer running all over the place, and ducks were swimming in the
creek, it was a truly picturesque moment. I also had a small run-in
with a big buck that was sleeping, luckily we settled our
differences and moved on. I hope you enjoy this little glimpse of a
natural riparian ecosystem as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache will require approximately 5 km (3 miles) of
walking, approximately 0.5 km (1/3 mile) of which is off-trail. The
rest is on or around the paved path known as the Indian Creek Trail
in Overland Park which runs through Indian Valley Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The off-trail portion of this cache could result in wet feet
depending on your approach, this should be no big deal in the
Summer or Spring but in the Winter or Fall I recommend you find the
dry route unless you have good waterproof boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete this cache you will need to set your gps unit to UTM
coordinates mode. For many gps users this will be a new experience,
but it is not that hard. If UTM confuses you skip the cache
instructions to read below about UTM and come back to them. If you
are unsure of how to set this up in your gps unit refer to the
user's manual or google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you attempt this cache and fail or give up please report
a DNF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cache Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to stage 1 at UTM 15S E 352623 N 4309061.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stage 1
Instructions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find Iksorb's numbers (A, B, and C from left to
right):&lt;br/&gt;
A = &amp;lt;3 digit number&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
B = &amp;lt;3 digit number&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
C = &amp;lt;4 digit number&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;
D = A + B + C&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If D is even:&lt;br/&gt;
DIRH = West, DIRV=South&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If D is odd:&lt;br/&gt;
DIRH = East, DIRV=North&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head West on the trail, at the next two forks travel
DIRH on the trail and leave Indian Valley Park. Enjoy
your walk through the beautiful and scarce woods that remain of
Overland Park and go to the first playground that you find along
the trail, this is stage 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stage 2
Instructions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a playground along the Indian Creek Trail. There are
many like it but this one is your stage 2 waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K = the number of picnic tables at this
playground&lt;br/&gt;
L = the number of swings at this playground&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return to and continue in the same direction on the Indian Creek
Trail until the trail passes under a bridge, this is stage 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stage 3
Instructions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P = (K * 100) + (L * 4) - 1&lt;br/&gt;
Q = (K * L * 30) + P - 355&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand where the trail exits from under the bridge. By modifying
your current UTM coordinates go to stage 4 which is P
meters DIRV and Q meters
DIRH of your current location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stage 4
Instructions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S = &lt;br/&gt;
T = &lt;br/&gt;
U = 332190 + D + S - 64&lt;br/&gt;
V = 4300000 + T + 1154 - 130&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to UTM 15S E U N V. &lt;em&gt;As always replace the
cache exactly as you found it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The UTM Coordinate System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;UTM Basics&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will use UTM coordinates, which is a simple
&lt;em&gt;(x,y)&lt;/em&gt; coordinate system, like what is taught in high
school geometry. The primary advantage of the UTM coordinate system
is that one can quite easily modify any UTM coordinates, including
their current location, in order to refer to a point any given
distance to the North, South, East, or West by adding or
subtracting the distance in meters to the desired location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Coordinates
Explained&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTM 15S E 356300 N 4303250&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15S refers to an area on the UTM grid which
approximately contains eastern Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gisnotes.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/utmworld.gif&quot;&gt;see grid&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E 356300 is what is called the Easting, and
represents the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;(x,y)&lt;/em&gt; coordinate pair,
with a unit of measurement in meters. Therefore, by adding 1 to the
Easting this would refer to a location 1 meter to the East, and by
subtracting 1 this would refer to a location 1 meter to the
West.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N 4303250 is what is called the Northing, and
represents the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;(x,y)&lt;/em&gt; coordinate pair,
with a unit of measurement again in meters. Therefore, by adding 1
to the Northing this would refer to a location 1 meter to the
North, and by subtracting 1 this would refer to a location 1 meter
to the South.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Practical
Application&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the information above if one were at the location UTM
15S E 356300 N 4303250 and wanted to navigate to a point 250
meters (roughly 750 feet) to the East and 300 meters (roughly 900
feet) to the South you would add 250 to the Easting and subtract
300 from the Northing. The desired destination than is UTM
15S E 356550 N 4302950 (356300 + 250 == 356550
and 4303250 - 300 = 4302950).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;GPS Device
Settings&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use UTM coordinates in your GPS unit system settings set the
coordinate/unit type to UTM (or Universal Transverse Mercator),
refer to the user's manual if you cannot find this setting. In
Garmin devices this can be found in &lt;em&gt;Main
Menu-&amp;gt;Setup-&amp;gt;Units-&amp;gt;Position Format-&amp;gt;UTM UPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Go to the red shelter at N 38° 55.508' W 94° 41.873'. Find the
value of X by solving the riddle below then solve the equations to
determine the final location for the cache.
&lt;p&gt;From the view of the shelter, facing just west of south, you
will see a metal figure, neither short nor stout.&lt;br/&gt;
A most useful fact, which you'll need for the math, is the number
of pipes coming out of its hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;A = ( (3^X) + (X + 1) ) * 11&lt;br/&gt;B = ( K - (250 + A) ) - (X + 1)&lt;br/&gt;J = X + (A - 15)&lt;br/&gt;K = ( (A * 20) - 300 ) + (75 * X)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
N 38° A.B&lt;br/&gt;W 94° J.K
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bring your own pen. Replace as you found.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A camo’d sandwich-size loc-n-loc-type container in a small Lenexa park. It’s named for the nearby playground equipment which will often make muggle avoidance very difficult. Park hours are 5:00 am to Midnight. The container has room for a few small tradeables or trackables, but is too small for a pen; so bring your own. Please hide back as you found it or better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While trying to look innocent, you can check out the plaque in the stone at the west end of the park. It tells about the Fareed family who came to this country in pursuit of the American dream in 1961. They donated the land for the park in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache includes an unactivated geocoin for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed with permission of Lenexa Parks and Recreation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-1-2009: Made recommended boost in difficulty rating. Thanks kcmose and GN&amp;D for the helpful feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feb 2009: Moved to east end of park after Park Dept. destroyed hiding place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5-25-2010: Replacement container is a small, painted screw-top container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8-14-2010: added hint

Please use the off-street parking available on the north side of the road on E 87th Street just east of Blue River Road.  

The container has plenty of size for coins and small travel bugs.

Hint is a strong spoiler.

If you would like more information about the arson fire and explosion that took these firefighter’s lives, feel free to email me and I will send you a pdf about the incident.

Once you complete this cache, make sure to do the Bring Your Ladder multi-cache that starts at this memorial.

FTF has first shot at picking up a coin honoring another fallen hero.

You are looking for a large cache hidden in a most unexpected way. Be sure and sign the log and replace the cache same as you found it so that the next cacher can have the same experience.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was a beautiful fall day when I planted this cache; lovers were walking hand and hand, babies were being pushed in swings, and couples and families were having portraits taken all over the park.  I’m sure you’ll love finding this cache, make sure to bring along someone you love.  Finding this cache will require that you take a break and smell the roses.

Congrats to Monkeybugs for being FTF. This cache has been placed in Eastern Independence, along a new bi-way running north/south, from MO-24 hwy to MO-40 hwy., east of MO-291 hwy. Located to the north of the cache, is the site of the old Independence Memorial Airport. Located to the south of this spot are the new Independence Regional Medical Center, Independence Events Center, and The BassPro Shops. There are many new attractions out this way including a family water park and a &quot;tru-man-ly&quot; amazing historical district. We have two &quot;fan-tastic&quot; pro-team stadiums, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium. Not to mention, many excellent resturant types to choose from. As well as, family-friendly parks and trails located nearby good for walking, hiking or biking or even just hanging out and relaxing. So good luck to all, spend the day, and check out the many other caches that are in the area. Because of the specific location of this cache, it may not be EASILY accessible for the disabled.</groundspeak:long_description>

Permission granted by property owner Jerry Henson. PLEASE DO NOT BLOCK DRIVE. BYOP. Wheel chair accessible. My kid worked here for 5 years, we drove for almost 4 of them. Lotta P&amp;G nights here. Only we were grabbing up our kid. Asphalt up to cache. No climbing, bushwacking, digging or moving objects required. Just reach out and grab it. Easy access for anyone over 30&quot; tall. Only rated 2 dif. because certain times and days may experience high muggle traffic.
Be discrete in your capturing of the cache. Changing seasons and precipitation quantities may cause it to be almost inaccessible for the disabled. Happy hunting.
As I am not far from it please notify immediately should maintenance issues or muggle discovery occur to the cache container(camo'd match stick container). 
Congrats to lookerandscoffer for being FTF!!! Sounds like it was gona be neck and neck but you are my first!!

Pretty simple, get past the initial coverage and it's in plain sight. Small traders inside. Please help yourself, remember to drop 1 if you take 1.
Our family has enjoyed biking/hiking these trails since we moved here 10+ yrs. ago. Never knowing the goodies hiding throughout. An out-of-town relative turned us on to Geocaching, it's addictive that's for sure. This our 1st cache hide. My daughter and I will be putting a string of these caches out but they won't all be in the midwest........ 
Congrats to Potato Finder, it's always nice being in the right place at the right time. Thanks for being my first!!!

&lt;strong&gt;General Information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This offset multicache is available from 6 A.M to 10 P.M. due to
park hours restrictions. Please follow these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rugged, rewarding, and scenic cache in Liberty Bend
Conservation Area is not for the faint of heart. Getting this cache
will require at least a 3.5 mile round trip hike through woods,
including one quarter mile of bush-whacking. For most people this
will take 2-3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During spring and summer months there will be heavy overgrowth,
ticks, poison ivy, and maybe even the occasional snake. Even during
fall and winter the bush-whacking can get rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hike begins at LaBenite Park on the LaBenite trail at N 39°
10.042 W 094° 23.370. There is no road access to Liberty Bend CA,
access is only available via hiking in on the trail. From here it
is a 1.5 mile hike to the stage 1 coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cache Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park in LaBenite park at N 39° 10.042 W 094° 23.370. Go to stage
1 at N 39° 10.002 W 094° 21.750. Compute the coordinates for the
final cache location using the clue and formulas below. Significant
and lengthy bush-whacking will be required to reach the cache from
stage 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face east and look at the diamond sign on the post. Count the
number of squares on the sign, not including the sign itself. This
number is X.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A = X + 1&lt;br/&gt;
B = (A * 100) - 100&lt;br/&gt;
C = ( (B / 100) * 3) - 3&lt;br/&gt;
D = (C * 40) + 56&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real cache is located at: N 39° A.B, W 094° C.D&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Once found replace the cache exactly as you found
it.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Enjoy the scenic views of the river and the wonderful
riparian ecosystem. Please submit pictures of your caching
experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Safety Information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hunting is allowed on Liberty Bend CA. It is recommended to
wear hunter's orange or other bright colors during deer season (Sep
25. - Jan. 25) and turkey season (Apr.19 - May 9). &lt;a href=&quot;http://mdc4.mdc.mo.gov/applications/MoRegs/moarearegexceptions.aspx?txtAreaID=9726&amp;amp;txtAreaNm=Liberty%20Bend%20CA&amp;amp;txtCounty=&amp;amp;txtRegion=&amp;amp;txtUserID=Nelsom&amp;amp;txtDivision=&amp;amp;txtDoveMap=notfound&amp;amp;Source=Intranet&amp;amp;AUS=86236887631671&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nothing good happens after-hours in city parks, follow the park
hours and all other regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use caution during high water events, the river is close and
high ground isn't easily reached. When in doubt check the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=eax&amp;amp;gage=kcdm7&amp;amp;view=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1&quot;&gt;

below its banks at Liberty Bend CA.&lt;/li&gt;

What a way to start the day! 
The first stop on our&quot;Two States Three Counties&quot;Tour!
From our searches in this park for previous caches, we thought we would start our search early.
But even at this early hour the &quot;joint was a jumpin'&quot; Kind of scary actually.
I would recommend never coming to this park alone.
The search for this one was like some of the ones we went after when we first started geocaching, 
The trek to part one was a real adventure! But the second was even better.
I was sure glad when we got to the finale' that I carried a walking staff!!!
Coordinates arrived at after solving equation were spot on, kudos on a real class act for a first time cache listing!
Thanks for the time and effort spent on this multi-cache. We enjoyed the adventure.

See ya'

Conservation Area.

&lt;strong&gt;General Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This offset multicache is available from 6 A.M to 10 P.M. due to
park hours restrictions. Please follow these rules.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is a 1.6 mile round trip hike starting from La Benite
park, leading into Liberty Bend Conservation Area. The Lewis and
Clark historical markers which line the trail along the Missouri
River here are central to the cache.
&lt;p&gt;The shade of the trees and the cool breeze coming off the river
make for a rather cool hike despite the summer heat. The cache is
not far off trail, so it's not so bad to retrieve in the summer
despite some undergrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cache Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Park at the end of La Benite Park and begin hiking the La Benite
trail at N 39° 10.037' W 94° 23.368'. At each interpretive sign you
pass collect the information specified below to determine the final
location for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each sign determine the earliest year mentioned in the text.
Ignore time periods such as &quot;1820s&quot; or &quot;1800s&quot;. Once you have read
the fourth sign determine the location of the cache with the
equations below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Puzzle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Solve the equations below using the cache instructions above.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;W = earliest year on 1st interpretive sign&lt;br/&gt;X = earliest year on 2nd interpretive sign&lt;br/&gt;Y = earliest year on 3rd interpretive sign&lt;br/&gt;Z = earliest year on 4th interpretive sign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A = 5 * ( ( W - 4 ) / 1000 )&lt;br/&gt;B = X - 1766 - A&lt;br/&gt;J = Y - 1782&lt;br/&gt;K = Z - 1101 - J&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The final cache is located at:
&lt;pre&gt;
N 39° A.0B'&lt;br/&gt;W 94° J.K'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Replace the cache as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;

The Sanctuary portion of this church was built by the Luthern's in 1882. In about 1902, ownership was transferred to the Christian Seince church. They added the North half of the building for class rooms and fellowship. The church has a very nice pipe organ in it which was installed in 1917. This organ is still in good condition and is used every Sabbath by the Seventh Day Adventist who acquired  the church in 2001.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Thanks to local mining companies and the effortst of local legislators and community leaders, this attraction became a destination park in Webster County in 2006. 
The first phase of the park is complete with 15 miles of trails running through native prairie vegetation and naturalized trees, a 1½ mile long motocross course, a safety training area, a youth riding area, and a parking area for 350 vehicles with trailers. It is a great place to see some spectacular riding! In the right weather, especially on weekends, there may be quite a few muggles. The next phase of development includes plans for a camping area.

Park is open from sunrise to sunset 7 days a week. Please do not park on the main road, there is plenty of parking at the site.

About the Gypsum:
One of the softest minerals known to exist is the basis for one of Iowa's most durable mineral resource industries. Gypsum is a gray to white-colored mineral that can be easily scratched with a fingernail, and is referred to chemically as a hydrous calcium sulfate.

Gypsum has several principal uses. Ground gypsum is added to Portland cement to slow the setting time of the cement. Pulverized gypsum, and to a lesser extent anhydrite, is used in agriculture as a soil conditioner and as an animal-food additive. The best known use of gypsum is as the principal ingredient in the manufacture of wallboard and plaster.

Since the 1850s, people have utilized the gypsum deposits found in Iowa. The first published report of the large gypsum resource was by geologist David Dale Owen in 1852 after noting outcrops along the banks of the Des Moines River valley in the Fort Dodge area during an 1849 trip into Webster County. The &quot;Fort Dodge Beds,&quot; as the gypsum-bearing formation subsequently became known, were regarded by Charles Keyes in 1893 to be &quot;by far the most important bed of plaster-stone known west of the Appalachian chain, if not in the United States.&quot;

During this time, the dimensioned gypsum stone was taken from the Cummin's quarries along Soldier Creek northwest of Fort Dodge. Natural exposures of gypsum still can be seen along this creek in Snell Municipal Park. It was in 1872 that Captain George Ringland, Webb Vincent, and Stillman T. Meservey formed a partnership, known as the Fort Dodge Plaster Mills, for the purpose of mining, grinding, and preparing gypsum for commercial products. These men constructed the first gypsum mill west of the Mississippi, at the head of what is now Gypsum Creek, and initiated the long and continuing history of gypsum production in Iowa.

As soldiers arrived in the area in August of 1850, those who settled with them began to think of the need for land which could be developed into a cemetery. In 1859 a local man named Egbert Bagg was hired to design and layout the cemetery. Bagg was an acquaintance of Major William Williams who is considered by many to be the father of Fort Dodge, having plotted the city after the soldiers were ordered to abandon the fort and were moved north to Minnesota.

Bagg was an architect originally from Utica, New York. He was paid the generous sum of $150 to design and build Oakland Cemetery. In 1866 Oakland was incorporated as &quot;Oakland Cemetery Association.&quot; The association purchased the forty acres for $700. At the time, the cemetery’s location was three-quarters of a mile outside city limits.

Oakland Cemetery was designed according to the Rural Cemetery Movement which began in the early 19th century. The purpose of the movement was to move cemeteries out of the center of towns. RCM cemeteries were designed as parks with winding roads, graves that follow the roads, and beautiful landscaping. The hope was that RCM cemeteries would provide a pleasant place for families to visit deceased loved ones.

Oakland Cemetery was plotted in 1877 by E. G. Morgan. The cemetery was operated for over 100 years, until 1984, by volunteers. Merill and Blanche Saunders were the last volunteers, having served from 1964 to 1984 when the cemetery was deeded to the City of Fort Dodge. In 1985 Mayor Jim Janvrin placed Oakland under the jurisdiction of the city’s Parks, Recreation and Forestry division.

An appeal to the National Register of Historic Places was filed in 1998 by the Fort Dodge Historic Preservation group. That request was granted and in the year 2000 Oakland Cemetery was placed on the National Register.

The cemetery is the final resting place for many of the people instrumental in early Fort Dodge history. Those of note include Major William Williams, the founder of Fort Dodge; Dr. Stephen Olney, Fort Dodge’s first doctor; Brevet General Leander Blanden; Dr. Thomas Fitzhugh Grayson, a Confederate soldier who practiced medicine in Fort Dodge for 36 years; Senators Jonathan P. Dolliver and William S. Kenyon; Cyrus Carpenter, Governor of the State of Iowa from 1872 to 1876, and Lili Damita, the first wife of actor Errol Flynn.

There are more than 200 Civil War veterans buried in the cemetery, including two black soldiers. The monument to the unknown soldiers of the Civil War was created by local sculptor William Pollack, himself a Civil War veteran. This monument was unveiled and dedicated May 30, 1900.

A variety of sizes and styles of headstones, including different signs and symbols used on grave markers throughout the centuries, can be seen while visiting this historic site. It's well worth your time to stroll through the setting!

You may encounter deer, owls and a variety of song birds.

Great idea for a cache and tribute to area caching legend BRL. Nice puzzle, great container and a wonderful Stearns County Park. It doesn't get any better than this.

I was hoping to make a selection from the Library. Didn't find anything of interest. I beleive libraries are now often called Media Centers. Wonder if this themed cache would be open to other formats. Just an idea.

I donated a book, &quot;Bob Marley, Island Prophet&quot; by Mitchell Uscher. I believe this was the book at least. It's a simple and short biography of Robert Nesta Marley. Hope someone will enjoy it.

I swapped TBs here as well, grabbing a wooden nickle Thing 2 and dropping off &quot;Aroma&quot; a skunk TB on the move.

Thanks again for the fine cache,

I notice a couple new caches in Warner Lake Park. Thought I would go take a look. Took down some coordinates, loaded up Lilly, the caching dog and headed out.

Didn't know if I was up to this walk when I left the cachemobile. Found my caching legs .25 miles down the trial. It was a beautiful day, clear and in the mid 40's. Lilly was loving this. 

Planned on returning to this cache after attempting a First to Find on the other. Thought the better of it when I realized I might want to take the trail all the way around the lake, something I had never done before.

Found this cache well hid and in good shape. Dropped in a small flashlight (too late for BigRedLibrarian I guess), STL and replaced. I love Stearns County Parks!

TFTC,

Kurt and Lilly

I stopped, hoping to find this one today and I did, without much trouble, in fact I really enjoyed it. Stage 1 could use some attention though. The coordinates are there but it's in a couple pieces and I'm worried about how long it's going to be legible. I didn't have anything to replace/repair the coordinates or I would have.

Great cache, good hides with dead on coordinates. I am alittle worried about the note inside Stage 1 and have logged a &quot;Needs Maintenance&quot; note for the owner. This is a real nice multicache. I hope it hangs in there. Beware: I did notice abit of poison ivy near the final.

The Easter Egg Hunt was well planned and placed by Loudy13, BB13, DKEL, EvilQueen13. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With many cachers on the trail after these eggs, I met a couple on the trail. I did see many logs from others. This made for a very fun day. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the crew for all their work for the Egg Hunt. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF = BigRed_Librarian

Took a shot at the First To Find on this one this morning. The cache was still unlogged as we left the house at 10:20. I didn't hold out much hope. (I know these Firsters to be a godless bunch and was sure some of them would be caching instead of in church this morning.) Guess I missed it by 90 minutes, or a day...Third to find, STL and replaced.

Spent some time looking. I checked my GPS notes and knew I was looking for something that hadn't been found lately. Now that I'm home and have read the cache page, I have an idea where it is located. Maybe Squachmeb should check his coat pockets or the shelf above his washing machine?

After spending most of this gorgeous weekend at home I just had to get out and do something. I had been ignoring/saving a bunch of caches down this way. (12 caches is actually constitutes a &quot;bunch&quot;.) This was just what the doctor ordered, if the doctor was Jam3s-MD, yoteman-DDS or wishin4walleyes-PHD. I was excited to be on the trail again.

I had been to this area a few years back. Lucky to make some additional discoveries today. The river, the big vertical tree, the trail and the old railroad bridge. I spent some time searching, checking the last logs, size and difficulties. Lots of hidey holes around here. Finally decided to consider the name of the cache. Lightbulb!

Made the find, STL and dropped in a geocoin I have been carrying around. Thanks for getting me out of the house and back to Clearwater.

This was the begining of a long day. Started out caching SE of town, Lake Maria State Park. In a minute my directions changed as I rushed to a tennis match in Benson, MN. Tough day for anything but caching as the winds were reported in excess of 35 mph all day.

Found this creative cache without much trouble. Worried when I saw this cache from yoteman. Extracted the log without much trouble, STL and replaced. 

Thanks for another creative cache,

On the home leg of my Lake Maria trek today. Caching all morning there and back. Great day. These caches are along one of my favorite bicycling routes. I love to ride down CR8 on the east side of the Mississippi and back on CR75. Wasn't planning on riding it for a few more months yet. Love to ride and cache but I couldn't wait.

Found this one quickly, STL and replaced.

A&lt;br/&gt;cooperative movement with several other municipal governments&lt;br/&gt;provides library service and a bike/recreation trail that will&lt;br/&gt;eventually link the Beaver Island Trail in St. Cloud, with the City&lt;br/&gt;of Clearwater, also runs through Lynden Township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache should be pretty simple.

Out night caching out of neccessity. I am needing a 12/23 cache to fill in a block on my KB Days of the Year challenge. I have to work all day tomorrow so it was tonight or next year for me.

I was happy to be back at the Girl Scout Council. They were good enough to provide a meeting space for our monthly NAACP meetings for many years. Although I have 3 sons, I am a big fan of Girl Scouting.

Happy/lucky to make this find tonight. I was added by a set of footprints in the snow. As the previous finders must have, I checked one spot then the other. Made the find, grabbed a GS TB, STL and replaced. Time to head home. Gotta work in the morning.

 Out cacheing with a Jam3s and half of the O'Dell Family. What fun! Fun to cache with freinds and a great cache as well. This is what multi-cache should look like. The stages are well defined and the &quot;Theme&quot; became clear as we neared the final. In fact, I was calling Jam3s 20 minutes after the find, as I was thinking even more about this one.

One of the stages held a big surprise for me. WooHoo! (That should last for 100 years I figure.) Wondered what HTim was talking about. Also, recieved a Facebook message from a non-caching friend. Wondered what he was doing weighing in on my &quot;Ollie's Folly&quot; comment. It all make sense now. (You were right Jeff.)

While I may never make full use of the facilities located near the final, I won't soon forget this cache. One of my favorites. Thanks for all the work that went into all of this.

As always, TFTC,

This is a long, sad story and I want to appoligize right up front. In my rush to get ready for the day I temporarily made a mess of this cache. I tried to squeeze to many things in this morning and didn't build in anytime for SNAFUs. I will attempt to keep this story short.

I had to get the boys up and out this morning. They were wonderful, no problem. Had time to check my email before heading to work. No email at work anymore so this would be it for the next 24 hours. Oh look, a new local cache. I should have time to check it out. I headed out the door to warm the car, -23 degrees this morning. 

It snowed abit last night and before I could leave the snowplow went by. Hating to leave the driveway snowed up I took a minute to clear it out and the sidewalk drifts as well.This took abit more time than I planned but still, pleanty of time to catch this P&amp;G I figured. I turned on my GPS and headed out.

As I arrived at GZ I had a pretty good idea where and what I was after. What do you know, there it was. I jumped back into the cachemobile to put a legible signature in the log, writing -23 next to the date. As I went to close the cache container it slipped from my cold/clumsy hands, hitting the side of my leg and falling under the car seat. Roh roh!

Grabbing my flashlight I began the search. This wasn't going to be fun. I cleared a couple candy wrappers and found a dime and a nickel but no cache. Dangit. The clock was ticking as I continued to search in the bitter cold. I was running out of time and decided to head off to work, not wanting to endager my job over a nano. (A FTF to be sure, but a nano?) I would have time, space and heat in able to look for it this evening.

As I headed off to work I wondered who else might be coming to find this cache this morning. What could I do in the meantime. I have no internet access until tomorrow. I got to work with no time to spare. The first call I made was to yoteman, thinking he may be on the hunt this morning. Yoteman did not answer but I left a message anyway. The next call was to Jam3s. I have only met him once but was smart enough to grab his phone number. I explained the situation and appoligized. He was understanding.

Yoteman called me back very quickly. I am sorry to say I was right. He had spent too much time looking for a cache he wasn't going to find today. I appoligized to him as well.

I did find the cache, for the second time, later that evening. Up under the seat and floor mat. Now to get it back in action. if Jam3s hasn't already replaced it.

TFTC,

Kurt

Today the boys went out and hid a Geocache. this is their cache and they were pretty excited. they asked if someone might find it by friday so they would know about it. I said someone would probably find it as soon as it is published. so to help the boys out, please come find this as soon as published. </groundspeak:long_description>

Working on the KB - Days of the Year Challenge, I needed a 6/5 cache. I woke early to head out before work. I just wanted to find one, any one. This one was selected and saved for today. It's very near home and I was pretty confindent I might find it. 

Funny I needed a cache today. It's my birthday. After 6+ years of caching I have never gone out on my birthday? 

Made the find, STL and replace. I meant to drop in a Gecko TB. (Appropriatly, this one's called &quot;Senior Moment&quot;.) Maybe on my way home tomorrow, if I remember!

TFTC and Happy Birthday to me!

In need of a cache today, KB Days of the Year Challenge you know. Missed on this one before. Didn't give myself very good odds on it today either. Spent a few minutes searching. TaDah! STL and replaced. Looks like I might have just missed another cacher. Busy place all of a sudden.

TFTC,

(Actually logging this cache on 8/30. In my logging I had mistaken this cache for another - &quot;No Mas&quot;. Looking at my geocaching map today I noticed the mistake. Happy I was able to fix this mess. Whew!)</groundspeak:text>

Started looking for this one near 1:00 am. Work all day tomorrow and in desperate need of a cache for the KB Days of the Year Challenge. I've been saving this one for just this occasion. Didn't figure I wouldn't be able to find it. Spent 30 minutes before I had to give it up.

This is the start of my trip Up North. I am looking to log cache 1500 later today, Alvin's Phone Line , the oldest cache in MN.

I needed to start the day somewhere and this was it. Didn't realize with abit more planning I might have attempted a couple of First to Finds as well, oh well. I knew of Brainerd and Baxter, now Barrow?

&lt;p&gt;The old pump house, Brainerd's first means of water, is shown
here. When the dam went out in 1900, the pump house went too. It
was located at the end of Seventh Street, next to the Mississippi
River. -taken from Brainerd Centennial history book published in
1971 (&lt;i&gt;thanks forthillbillies&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older locals know the hill as pumphouse hill and it is a
moderately steep slope as well as a great sliding hill in the
winter now that reconstruction of the storm sewers are complete.
The hiding place is near what's left of the foundation of the old
pumphouse and there are many little places where the cache could be
found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry point and best place to park is along Bluff Street at
7th Ave N and the path to access the short hike to the cache.
During the spring the entire area is prone to flooding due to its
proximity to the Mississippi River. (It was when I placed the
cache.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a large vitamin bottle and has very small tradeable
items. It also can hold a few small trackable items including
micro-coins.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Got the lowdown on the coordinates before heading to this one, because I'm sure there will be some DNF's logged before the owner makes the corrections. Got the stamp and headed for the next nearest cache. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I saw this tree in the morning as I was passing by and thought
what a perfect place for a cache.

A Red Fox was hanging out at the location as I pulled up to
place the cache. He didn't even see me because he was so busy
eating his recent kill. And that's how I came up with the name.

Good Luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

The Heartland Trail was one of the first rail-to-trail projects
in the country. It is a 49 mile multiple use trail between Park
Rapids and Cass Lake. The trail is located entirely on a level
abandoned railroad grade except for a four mile segment north of
Walker, on sharply rolling terrain. The 27 mile segment between
Park Rapids and Walker has a paved surface. This segment also has a
second grassy treadway for horseback riding and mountain biking.
The 20 mile segment from Walker to Cass Lake is also paved, with a
partial dual treadway for snowmobiles with studded tracks.

You'll have to take a fair hike down the trail to get this one,
but you may want to get off the trail before you get to GZ because
of it's location. From the cache location you'll have a good view
of the trail and while I was there, a few muggles biked and skated
past without noticing what I was doing. A word to the wise, the
area is loaded with Poison Ivy, so be prepared, but I chose a
location that few plants near it.

Container is a large coffee can painted to match it's
surrounding. There is plenty of room to leave and trade Travel Bugs
&amp; GeoCoins. And the standard swag for the kids.

Please replace exactly as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

You'll have to take a small walk down the trail to get this one.
Once you're there take a break and you'll have the cache in no

Cache is a very small canister wrapped in camo tape.

The Heartland Trail was one of the first rail-to-trail projects in the country. It is a 49 mile multiple use trail between Park Rapids and Cass Lake. The trail is located entirely on a level abandoned railroad grade except for a four mile segment north of Walker, on sharply rolling terrain. The 27 mile segment between Park Rapids and Walker has a paved surface. This segment also has a second grassy treadway for horseback riding and mountain biking. The 20 mile segment from Walker to Cass Lake is also paved, with a partial dual treadway for snowmobiles with studded tracks.

The Heartland Trail was one of the first rail-to-trail projects
in the country. It is a 49 mile multiple use trail between Park
Rapids and Cass Lake. The trail is located entirely on a level
abandoned railroad grade except for a four mile segment north of
Walker, on sharply rolling terrain. The 27 mile segment between
Park Rapids and Walker has a paved surface. This segment also has a
second grassy treadway for horseback riding and mountain biking.
The 20 mile segment from Walker to Cass Lake is also paved, with a
partial dual treadway for snowmobiles with studded tracks.

The name of this cache comes from the location of one the local
towers that used to be near here. Forest Fire Lookout towers in
Minnesota have a long history as in other states across the nation.
The earliest were &quot;Tree lookouts&quot; , a few of which can still be
located in the northern counties. Most of Minnesota's forestry fire
lookouts though were constructed during the era of the 3 C's, the
Civilian Conservation Corps, a project of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
&quot;National Recovery Act&quot; of the 1930's. Thousands of young men were
put to work doing projects across the country. Another divison of
this was the WPA or &quot;Works Project Administration&quot;.

In Conservation, hundreds of steel fire towers were erected
during this time, many in Minnesota's back woods and rolling
farmlands. It was said that at one time, there was a fire tower
every eight square miles in the northern counties of the state.
State Parks and National Parks were created under Roosevelt's
administration, and to guard them were built fire towers. They were
operated by CCC boys and later on, most were turned over to the
Department of Natural Resources DNR.

The final location of this cache brings you to the footings of
the DORSET Fire Tower that was taken down in the mid 1990's. Often
it costs more money to take down one of these old towers than is
economically feasible, so many unfortunately have been sold just
for their scrap metal value.

Container is a plastic jar painted with camo to match it's
surrounding.

Easy Park &amp; Grab right off Hwy 34 in the city of Nevis.
Located at the trail-head for the Heartland Trail. I and a few
other local cachers were thinking this area needed some more caches
located along this great paved corridor between Park Rapids and
Walker.

Cache is a film canister with camo tape to help hold it in its
hiding spot.

Please review the ratings and attributes for this cache
closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to this cache may require a high clearance vehicle,
especially during wet, rainy, muddy, or snow, conditions. If
there's mud on the road, you should be aware of a couple of
things.. 1. The potholes and ruts DO have bottoms so your 4x4 will
make it through the holes if you keep moving. 2. You might get back
there with your Nissan or Volkswagon but you may not get out.
Bottom line is, if conditions are wet, BEWARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the cache, starting at the additional waypoint marked
HEAD and follow the logging road to the very end. At this point, do
your CITO, then look for the cache on the south side of the circle.
It is not meant to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HD379M6 - Logging Road Entrance&lt;br/&gt;N 46° 59.636 W 094° 15.092&lt;br/&gt;Logging Road Entrance</groundspeak:long_description>

As I pulled up to GZ I started to shake my head knowing who made this hide. Luckily I had my flashlight and LED lantern to give me some extra light to make the find, because the skeeters wanted to sample what I was offering, and I didn't want them to call in backup, so I had to work quickly . Signed log and found a suitable place to turn around to continue my journey back home. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located off the North Country Trail, which runs from North Dakota to New York.  This part of the trail is very pretty, running along the Shingobee River.  The trail rises above the river valley and the hills are steep in places.  This part of the trail is also part of the course for the Walker North Country Marathon.  So, it's best not to be on this trail on race day.  The best place to park is where the trail enters the woods, off County Road 50.  Or, there is a parking lot near the bridge, but involves a little further walk.  
The cache container is fairly small, but will accommodate smaller items such as keychains, marbles, superballs, etc.  The initial loadout contains assorted swag as well as the FTF dollar.  There's a compartment inside the lid as well, which is a perfect little spot for geocoins.  
Once you're at GZ, you'll be able to retrieve the cache, which isn't right at the coordinates.  After you sign the log, please return the cache to its original position. Thank you!
Good luck and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a great little spot, don't be fooled if it looks like someones driveway, it is a Public Water Access. It also has this great peninsula that juts out into the lake about a quarter mile and its a great hike to the end. 

Cache is a regular size container with room for tradeable items and goodies for the kids. The kids will love this place for a hike because there is a makeshift fort at the end built by some locals.

This cache is along The North Country National Scenic Trail (NCT) between the &quot;Go Take A Hike!&quot; (GC2FHXZ) cache and the &quot;A North Country Trail Head&quot; (GC2FHX2) cache. We placed this cache as we hiked in to Go Take A Hike cache.&lt;br/&gt;We are listing this cache to be winter friendly however this trail is NOT grommed during the winter months but is very well marked. The cache is located just off the trail a bit, so stay on the trail as far as you can before drifting off to GZ.&lt;br/&gt;The North Country National Scenic Trail stretches more than 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from Crown Point in eastern New York to Lake Sakakawea in western North Dakota. Pack your bags as it could be a L O N G hike? Take notice that this trail is limited to foot travel, including hiking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, no snowmobiles or ATV's are allowed!&lt;br/&gt;This trail is maintained primarily by volunteers so let's help them keep the trail looking nice,  please pick up any garbage you see alone your way in or out from the caches in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;((Please replace this cache exactly how you found it or better, so the next cacher/s can enjoy this cache as you have.))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Most Of All &quot;Have Fun&quot;!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrads go out to jeffrae and crew for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

It's located off a Low Maintenance road which does show up on my GPS. The roads into this cache are good, no need for 4-wheel drive. Once you get close to GZ you will have some bushwacking in the summer months only about 150 to 200 feet.

You'll be looking for a Nano sized camoed container so you will need to have a pen/pencil with you to sign the log and a tweezers might not be a bad idea as well to have with? Did I give it away?? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will take you onto or maybe I should say just off of the Paul Bunyan State Trail (paved) which travels northwest and southeast from Lake Bemidji State Park to the Crow Wing State Park in the Brainerd / Baxter area. This trail is used for walking, rollerblading and bike riding in the summer months and snowmobiling in the winter months. From north to south this trail covers 110 miles while passing through several towns. In the Walker area the Paul Bunyan and Heartland State Trails join as one for 8 or so miles. The Heartland State Trail travels to the north towards Cass Lake and to the southwest towards Park Rapids. These are great all season trails which make for great areas to hide caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is south of Beltrami Line Rd / Co. Hwy. 2 about .45 of a mile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;((Please replace this cache exactly how you found it or better, so the next cacher/s can enjoy this cache as you have.))&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Most Of All &quot;Have Fun&quot;!!</groundspeak:long_description>

My family moved to the area in 1976 and our pedal bikes took us to most of the area 'fun spots', I took the geomobile around his time as I searched out locations and it goes much faster.

I never made it here but we did go just around the corner to 'Knutson Dam' (GCZ7GE) to go swimming. The 7.5 miles back home sometimes defeated the purpose of going swimming in the first place.
I hope you like this little series of caches.

There is road construction on the Scenic Highway but the businesses are open.

Downtown Pennington- this wasn't here when we first arrived (well not this exact place) and neither was the ice cream, but in the other building there was a bar and a game room- that game room was tons of fun- I think the bikes could make it there all by themselves. The hill was fun for sledding too, just had to watch out for the vehicles on the road- but then the road wasn't nearly as busy then as it is now.
We have permission from the owners to have our fun here, there is no need to go around to the sides or back, let's be respectful so we can keep the cache here, thanks. I am hoping the container works, if it gets too wet from condensation- I will change it. Please make sure to snap the lid on.

We have permission from the owners to have our fun here and to enjoy their trail system, but beware there are eyes everywhere :) NO bushwhacking allowed, please stay on the trail so we can continue to enjoy it, thanks. You can park at N 47 30.793 W094 29.786 please stay to the side so you do not block the drive- there is room.

We had our own trail through the woods to come here to go swimming, a little rougher terrain but shaved off a couple miles.

Don't let the map fool you the road DOES NOT continue- you cannot get to 'Pennington Triangle:Close to Paradise' (GC2WR6Z) from here.
We have permission from the owners to have our fun here. (This is part of a golf course that the resort made for their guests.) And you should only have about 85’ of bushwhacking.

Blackduck to the North, Cass Lake to the South, and Bemidji to the west make the Pennington triangle. 
My family moved to the area in 1976 and our pedal bikes took us to most of the area 'fun spots', I took the geomobile around his time as I searched out locations and it goes much faster.

We had our own trail through the woods to come here to go swimming, a little rougher terrain but shaved off a couple miles.

Don't let the map fool you the road DOES NOT continue- you cannot get to 'Pennington Triangle:In Paradise' (GC2WR6Z) from here.
We have permission from the owners to have our fun here.

I hope you like this little series of caches.
It is a little bigger then a micro, but I wouldn’t necessarily call it a small either.

Dirt roads and bikes are not the best combination.
The cache started with book, games and toys.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache takes you to the town of Tenstrike, which is northeast of Bemidji or southwest of Blackduck. Hwy. 71 will take you to where you need to be. We don't recommend looking for this cache when this area is in use. Plenty of off and on street parking. At GZ you will be looking for a micro sized container. 

((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you have.))

Good Luck, Enjoy And Most Of All Have Fun!!</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It was a lazy morning and about 10:30 I checked my email. I told hubby that there was a new cache in Tenstrike and he told me to get the info and lets go, he meant it too because before I could get the coordinates he was in the truck with the geodogs and it was running. I was going to eat breakfast and not worry about being a FTF. But now that I have logged two of them, the next one this side of Bemidji just might have a contender.
