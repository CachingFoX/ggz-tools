            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Turks and Caicos National Museum Cache! You will be looking for a regular size Lock/Lock container on the grounds of the Museum. If you come by cruise boat, you can take a taxi or rent a car at the cruise boat terminal and visit this cache and see the island the way you want to see it. It is about 3 miles, as the crow flies, from the cruise boat dock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the country's first and only museum. It occupies a 150 year old residence, Guinep House, originally built by Bermudian wreckers from timbers they salvaged from ships that crashed on nearby reefs. Today about half of its display areas are devoted to the remains of the most complete archaeological excavation ever performed in the West Indies, the wreck of a Spanish caravel (sailing ship) that sank in shallow water sometime before 1513. At first it was thought the ship wreck was Columbus' Pinta, but researchers proved otherwise. Columbus was thought to have landed here during his explorations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you choose to visit the museum, (but not necessary to find the cache) a modest charge of $7 or $5 with proof of Cruise Boat identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having trouble finding the cache? Ask Nikki or any other museum worker, who will be happy to assist you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a cammo &quot;pre-form&quot; (like a test tube) cache container that is high above the ocean just outside of the fenced-in property of the light house grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is approximately 5 miles from the cruise boat docking area.  To get to the cache either rent a golf cart or grab a taxi to drive you around.  Both are available at the cruise boat terminal landing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please bring your own pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the island and watch out for the horses and donkeys roaming around without a home.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The 1,013-acre Barn Island Wildlife Management Area is the State's single largest coastal property managed for wildlife conservation. The property provides a diversity of ecoysystem and habitats including hilly uplands, agricultural/open fields, mixed hardwood forests and salt, brackish and freshwater tidal wetlands. The site is a popular hiking, wildlife observation and hunting area. *Deer hunting is allowed in-season at this site. Nearly 4 miles of trails are available at this site. Hikers are reminded to exercise caution when using the site during hunting season. Please check the CT DEP Wildlife Division website for details. Interpretive signs descrbing the Barn Island Wildlife Management Area and a recently created native plant demonstration garden provide an excellent venue for beginning your exploration of Connecticut's premier coastal wildlife management area. Look for Marsh Viewing Area sign on the left side of Palmer Neck Road opposite a small parking area before the road descends to the State boat launch to enter this site's trail system. http://www.facebook.com/pages/Barn-Island-Wildlife-Management-Area-Stonington-CT/112339965935&amp;ei=yfKNT4TNNIb20gGlo9mDDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEaoQQ2rACTouiZ1Mkzkmc7VuiBXA&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Newport, Rhode Island is a very historic town with lots of beautiful views of the ocean and many, many monuments. At Brenton Point stands a well known monument to all the sailors who have perished at sea, Mariner's Point. What is not so well known is a smaller area dedicated to those who lost their loved ones on board Egypt Air Flight 990. This plane went down into the Atlantic, some 60 miles from this point of land, on October 31, 1999 taking over 200 people's lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To claim this find, you will need the name from the brick that is on the next to the bottom row on the extreme Right side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the monument itself is fully accessible, the grassy area may present some problems if the area is wet, so be careful. You may wish to bring a kite and fly from the adjacent field area. Alternately, bring a lunch, enjoy the view and watch the seagulls!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A cache placed in honor of a mysterious discovery that was
made…..long...long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skeleton in Armor is the name given to a skeleton associated
with metal, bark and cloth artifacts which was unearthed in Fall
River, Massachusetts in 1832.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in the Destruction Brook Woods a DNRT property.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This 280 acre property was purchased in 2000 by DNRT and The
Trustees of the reservations. It is DNRT's largest reserve and
offers a variety of trails. It includes almost 10 miles of marked
trails. The mature woodlands include both American Beech and
Atlantic White Cedar. There are unusual rock ledges covered with
many interesting ferns and lichens, and Destruction Brook itself,
once a major source of power for the mills of Russells Mills runs
throught it. You can access more information about this reserve and
a trail map here:
http://www.dnrt.org/management/reserves/38.htm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please BYOP. I left it with just a log and five smackers for the
FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contemporary account of the skeleton's discovery and general
appearance was written by a Dr. Phineas W. Leland in 1843, soon
after the artifact's destruction. The text of the description was
as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the curiosities of peculiar interest (in the cabinets of
the Fall River Athenaeum) was the entire skeleton of a man, about
which antiquarians in the old as well as the new world had
speculated much. The skeleton was found in the year 1832 in a sand-
or grave-bank a little east of the Unitarian meetinghouse by some
persons while digging away and removing a portion of the bank. (On
or very near the site now occupied by the &quot;Gas-Works&quot;, corner of
Hartwell and Fifth Streets).The skeleton was found near the surface
in a sitting posture, the leg bones doubled upon the thigh-bones,
and the thighs brought up nearly parallel with the body. It was
quite perfect, and stood remarkably well the test of exposure.
Covering the sternum was a triangular plate of brass somewhat
corroded by time, and around the body was a broad belt made of
small brass tubes four or five inches in length about the size of a
pipe stem placed parallel and close to each other. Arrowheads made
of copper or brass were also found in the grave with the
skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another description of the artifact appeared in the January 1836
edition of Monthly Magazine, and was penned by a J. Stark. It reads
as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These remains were found in the town of Fall River, in Bristol
County, Mass., about eighteen months since. In digging down a hill
near the village, It large mass of earth slid off, leaving in the
bank and partially uncovered a human skull, which, on examination,
was found to belong to a body buried in a sitting posture, the head
being about one foot below what had been for many years the surface
of the ground. The surrounding earth was carefully removed and the
body found to be enwrapped in a covering of coarse bark of a dark
color. Within this envelope were found the remains of another of
coarse cloth, made of fine bark and about the texture of a Manilla
coffee-bag. On the breast was a plate of brass, thirteen inches
long, six broad at the upper end and five at the lower. This plate
appears to have been cast, and is from one-eighth to three
thirty-seconds of an inch in thickness. It is so much corroded that
whether or not anything was ever engraved upon it has not yet been
ascertained. It is oval in form, the edges being irregular,
apparently made so by corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After its discovery the skeleton was placed in the Fall River
Museum, where it was destroyed when the museum burnt down. Some of
the 'armor' however had already been sent to the Museum of
Copenhagen, and two of the brass tubes were donated to the Peabody
Museum in 1887.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was evidently familiar with the
artifact's discovery. Longfellow apparently considered that the
artifact was Norse in origin. Whether or not Longfellow concluded
that this was a genuine Norse artifact is unknown. Nevertheless, he
did immortalize the discovery in the poem &quot;The Skeleton in Armor&quot;.
The poem was first published in Lewis Gaylord Clark's The
Knickerbocker in 1841. In the poem, Longfellow also refers to the
Old Stone Mill in Touro Park in Newport, Rhode Island, also known
as the Newport Tower. Some suggest that the stone structure dates
back to the Viking exploration of North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be Warned because I didn't have a great signal when hiding the
hint is generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is at the Grange then a short walk up Fisher road to the
trail head. There is also a trail head in the Grange parking
lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please no spoilers so everyone has the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alright, here's the thing, I like finding them better then
hiding them so I've placed a cache (ammo box) full of cache
containers. Please feel free to take one and hide it. The only
rules are please keep your hides local. A 5-10 mile radius should
do nicely. I'll try to keep it stocked with containers (it depends
how fast they go). Starting out with 8 containers inside and some
Ben Franklin chips. There is also a Texas hold em' march madness
card coin for the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destruction Brook Woods is a DNRT property. Visit their website
DNRT.org for trail maps and information on this DNRT property as

American history. You’ll need to find the John Adams, George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson caches to be able to locate and
access Ben Franklin’s Treasure. Based on the Ethan Gage
adventures novels by William Dietrich.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parking is on Highland Road accross the street from the Tiverton
Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's more like a multi only each stage can be logged as
a find.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/strong&gt; (January 17, 1706 –
April 17, 1790) born and raised in Boston Massachusetts was one of
the most respected Founding Fathers of the United States. A noted
polymath, Franklin was a leading author and printer, satirist,
political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, inventor,
civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a
major figure in the history of physics for his discoveries and
theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod,
bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, swim fins at age
11, and was the first to propose a practice later adopted as
daylight savings time. He formed both the first public lending
library in America and the first fire department in Pennsylvania.
The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their
delegate to the second Continental Congress. In June 1776, he was
appointed as a member of the committee of five that drafted the
Declaration of Independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Great Great Great Great Grandfather, Ethan Gage became Ben
Franklin’s apprentice in 1782 when Ben was serving in Paris
as the U.S. Ambassador to France. The aging Franklin hardly needed
an apprentice at the age of 78, but he took on young Ethan as a
favor to Ethan’s father, who was a fellow Freemason. Franklin
took a liking to the young man. Ethan later remarked that Ben saw
him as kindred spirit of sorts. Although Ethan was Ben’s
apprentice for only three years, Franklin wrote him into his will.
Some think he did it to spite his son William, who remained loyal
to crown and left for England and never returned. When word reached
Ethan of Ben’s passing and his mention in the will, he was
stunned. He was working as a fur trapper on the American frontier
and in Canada, where he had quite a reputation as a sharpshooter
and gambler. While he made a modest living he longed to return to
Paris, the city where he served for Franklin. As luck would have it
the small fortune he inherited from Franklin allowed him to return
to France. Most people believed he gambled all his inheritance away
in Paris, but I know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan had written in his journal of a vast amount of wealth
including gold and Colonial currency from 1775, that he hid in the
forests of Rhode Island before leaving for France in 1798. The
journal mentions vague landmarks followed by an odd series of
numbers. All of the Gage descendants have tried to find the
treasure and failed, none of them could figure out the meaning of
the unusual numbers until now. I had long abandoned the search
myself years ago and having no children of my own, planned to will
the journal to the State. Then last year my wife got me a GPS
navigation unit and as I was getting acquainted with the system I
came across a very familiar series of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, my friend is where you come in. I’m an old man
incapable of traipsing about through forests in search of treasure.
If you do the leg work for me I’ll gladly share the fortune
with you. It won’t be easy mind you, but if you follow the
clues I know you’ll find it. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certificate and special prize awaits the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this cache please leave only your name in the log, unless
you have some treasure themed swag. Please help yourself to a
portion of the treasure except for the Colonial Currency so the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Adams&lt;/strong&gt; (October 30, 1735 – July 4,
1826) was an American statesman, diplomat and political theorist. A
leading champion of independence in 1776, he was the first Vice
President and second President of the United States
(1797–1801). A New England Yankee, he was deeply read and
represented enlightenment values promoting republicanism. A
conservative Federalist, he was one of the most influential
Founding Fathers of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American
Revolution. As a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental
Congress, he played a leading role in persuading Congress to
declare independence, he selected and assisted Thomas Jefferson in
drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776. One of his
greatest roles was as a judge of character: in 1775, he nominated
George Washington to be commander in chief of the Continental
Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/strong&gt; (April 13, 1743 – July
4, 1826) was the third President of the United States
(1801–1809) and the principal author of the Declaration of
Independence (1776). Jefferson was one of the most influential
Founding Fathers. He envisioned America as the force behind a great
Empire of Liberty that would promote republicanism and counter the
imperialism of the British Empire. Jefferson served as the wartime
Governor of Virginia (1779–1781), first United States
Secretary of State (1789–1793), and second Vice President of
the United States (1797–1801).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polymath, Jefferson achieved distinction as, among other
things, a horticulturist, political leader, architect,
archaeologist, paleontologist, musician, inventor, and founder of
the University of Virginia. When President John F. Kennedy welcomed
49 Nobel Prize winners to the White House in 1962 he said, &quot;I think
this is the most extraordinary collection of talent and of human
knowledge that has ever been gathered together at the White House
– with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined
alone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful the rocks can be very slippery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the feedback I've been getting from the logs I just want
to clarify that the listed coordinates were taken at the cache
location. I had about 10 feet accuracy when I made the hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Washington&lt;/strong&gt; (February 22, 1732 –
December 14, 1799) was the dominant military and political leader
of the new United States of America from 1775 to 1797, leading the
American victory over Britain in the Revolutionary War as commander
in chief of the Continental Army, 1775–1783, and presiding
over the writing of the Constitution in 1787. As the unanimous
choice to serve as the first President of the United States of
America (1789–1797), he developed the forms and rituals of
government that have been used ever since, such as using a cabinet
system and delivering an inaugural address. The president built a
strong, well-financed national government that avoided war,
suppressed rebellion and won acceptance among Americans of all
types. Acclaimed ever since as the &quot;Father of his country&quot;.
Washington has become a central icon of republican values, self
sacrifice in the name of the nation, American nationalism and the
ideal union of civic and military leadership. He reluctantly served
a second term as president. He refused to run for a third,
establishing the customary policy of a maximum of two terms for a
president.&lt;/p&gt;

caching is fierce. Boardwalk has already been bought, but I am sure
Park avenue is still available.Plenty of property available on
Baltic Ave! Happy Caching.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enough said. It is after all a fair game,&lt;br /&gt;
Roll them Dice, and pass go, or go directly to jail.&lt;br /&gt;
Grab Boardwalk, or live on Baltic Ave.&lt;br /&gt;
Feeling electric, buy yourself the electric company.&lt;br /&gt;
Want some adventure, to travel get on the Reading railroad,
stop.&lt;br /&gt;
Grab the cache should be a quick and smooth cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop and enjoy the pond, and trees!&lt;/p&gt;

This area is CLOSED dusk to dawn!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One pleasant afternoon Cindy Chipmunk, Helen Hedgehog and Sally Squirrel were enjoying their Darjeeling tea and lemon poppy muffins while participating in their favorite past time - gossiping about their small town neighbors, particularly about Mrs. Bunny and her visitors. Everyone knew Mrs. Bunny entertained both Mr. Beaver and Mr. Skunk on a regular basis; everyone except Mrs. Beaver, Mrs. Skunk, and Mr. Bunny, that is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suzy Skunk arrived late to the tea party that weekend and was surprised that Officer Otter was waiting for her. She told him that she needed to ’freshen up’ before tea and would be right back. Unfortunately for Mrs. Skunk, Officer Otter was there on official business: To gently break the bad news. Mr. Skunk was missing, as well as Mr. Beaver, and Mrs. Bunny! The Darjeeling tea and Lemon Poppy muffins were forgotten as the news spread like wildfire throughout the small town!! After all, the announcement was made at Gossip Central! Within the hour the entire town joined in the search (mainly to hear the latest juicy gossip).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Officer Otter is asking for additional volunteers. If you would like to help, go to the assigned coordinates and look for anything out of the ordinary. With all the townsfolk and geocachers searching, Officer Otter is hopeful that the three will turn up safely very soon. </groundspeak:long_description>

One good thing with all these thorns is that you do not have to bushwack here. You simply follow the trails!
Took nothing but left a Narrangasset Scout Shop badge.
I had lunch in the park before heading to this one.
Thanks.

With Non-SA accuracy is should be easy to find someone's stash from waypoint information. Waypoints of secret stashes could be shared on the Internet, people could navigate to the stashes and get some stuff. The only rule would for stashes is: Get some Stuff, Leave some Stuff!!&lt;br/&gt;I'm thinking of leaving a five gallon plastic bucket with lid at the stash point. Putting in some stuff. Adding a logbook and pencil so visitors can record their find.&lt;br/&gt;I'll look for a place near a road where few people would normally go...&lt;br/&gt;Have Fun!!&lt;br/&gt;Dave...</groundspeak:long_description>

Colt purchased and consolidated the Chase, Church and Van Wickle farms. He built a summer house (&quot;The Casino&quot;) on the grounds, as well as a stone barn to accommodate a prize herd of Jersey cattle. Within the huge barn is an elegant, octagonal room, designed to display the trophies which the cows were to win. In 1916 the finishing touches were added to the barn. An artist, brought from Paris to paint in Colt's Bristol home, came to the farm and painted a mural in Colt's barn office. That same year, Colonel Colt purchased the first Jerseys to occupy his magnificent barn. From these he hoped to breed the world's finest Jersey herd. </groundspeak:long_description>

When the war began, he was a militia private but emerged from the war with a reputation as George Washington's most gifted and dependable officer. There are many places throughout the United States named after him. Greene was born August 7, 1742 in Warwick, RI. He died suddenly from sunstroke at the age of 43 on June 19, 1786 in Edisto, SC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a memorial park named after him located at the junction of Victory Highway and Bowden Hill Rd in Greene, RI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an easy park &amp; grab.  The cache is a micro silver bison tube containing only a log. You will need to bring your own pencil/pen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please return cache back to it's original location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Congrats cyndeee2&amp;jeff  FTF*** </groundspeak:long_description>

Park at the end of Pig Hill road, Coventry. The audobon does have a parking lot just in a ways from where the pavement ends but it usually is gated off. Do not follow your car GPS telling you to enter from T.Parker Road unless you have a very high 4 wheel drive vehicle. You will be parking in Coventry, walking into Foster then back into Coventry as you cross my property line. Cachers have my permission to enter the property. You will see my house on the right and my neighbors on the left after you leave the trail. There is low brush as well as low branches from trees which may make it a little harder when foliage on trees. This is a snow friendly cache. Walking was pretty easy in the snow as well.&lt;br/&gt;Looking for a tupperware canister</groundspeak:long_description>

So, all shinny and new, it is time for a visit.&lt;br/&gt;LQQK at the pictures for the parking area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction here took well over a year to complete, but the wait was worth it. This is all new and begging for a cache.&lt;br/&gt;Natick is a very winding road. PLEASE keep it slow and be VERY cautions. The reason will become clear as you navigate to the GZ.&lt;br/&gt;The container is, well, can you say &quot;Oversize Lipstick&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Where it is and what it is attached to, is the question.&lt;br/&gt;Parking is in front of the gate and the DO NOT ENTER SIGN. Do NOT park in the drive way. Walk on the same side as the parking since the lane is wider there. &lt;br/&gt;Be careful, some drivers are not! To be safe, it may be best that you get off the road to search.&lt;br/&gt;Pictures of where to and where not to park are shown for reference. Make sure to check out the excelent photography.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Swamp Meadow Covered Bridge is the only covered bridge remaining on a public road in the state of Rhode Island. The bridge is located on Central Pike and Hemlock Brook near Route 94 in Foster. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bridge is an exact replica of a 1820 covered bridge. It's a little New England treasure in Rhode Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an easy park and grab. As you approach the bridge, you can pull off and park your vehicle on the right side of the dirt road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please return the cache back to it's original location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***9/19/2011 Congrats to theshadycacher  FTF***  </groundspeak:long_description>

Recommend parking in the lot at the park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a small trail into the woods, but the cache is
significantly far off of the trail to keep muggles away.
Overgrowth is manageable during winter, not sure what it will be like in
warmer months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally hiding my first cache.. There's a $1 coin for FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

It is at the head of Narragansett Bay, out over the water. It is a very easy paddle for a canoe or kayak. Due to several submerged obstructions I am warning against a vessel with a deep draft. It is a very easy under half mile paddle from any one of three or so possible public put-ins (launch sites). I chose this site because of its ease of access as well as all the activity that will be going on here over the next couple of years. The best time to do this is high tide. Its a fun place to sit and picnic,fish and sun. For those using nautical charts it is approximately midway between Nun (red) bouys #4 and #6. Good luck and have fun. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach the cache by walking along the curb near the
cemetery fence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A small cache in Providence near the North Burial Ground. Easy
access by taking exit 25b off of 95 north, the exit will fork, stay
to the right. Continue past the cache to the parking coordinates.
Due to the proximity of the highway off ramp I wouldn't recommend
it for young children, but if you bring them hold their hand and
don't let it go. The parking area listed has room for three cars
and is about 400 feet away from the cache. You should be able to
see your vehicle at all times. During softball season parking may
be difficult evenings and weekends. Please be careful after you
make the find not to drive up the off ramp. Drive east to North
Main Street and follow the signs for route 95 if that's where your
headed. The container is small/micro but will hold small trade
items. The cache is not in the cemetery and is not accessible from
the cemetery please stay on the curb. There is a one dollar coin
for the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had about 9 foot accuracy when I made the hide.&lt;/p&gt;

Found it on my way to a job interview, I hope it's a good luck charm lol, I left a marker, because I didn't have anything else to leave.

:-) 
somebody crammed a golf ball in, making it pretty hard to get the log book out, but I managed to do it. 
 This was a very clever and fun cache
 thank you!

All I had was a TomTom for my truck. After finding this one, the hook was swallowed. I had bitten it HARD.&lt;br/&gt;'twas a sad day when this got archived and the owner was no longer around. See &quot;Savannahs Tinderbell Treasure&quot; gc1gyyx for the sad story.&lt;br/&gt;The rest is history. Enjoy this new GZ just a few feet from the deceased one, but, DO NOT try to get to this from the big road. Real bad idea to do that!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is accessible from a dirt road originating from Deanville Rd. However, out of courtesy to the residents of this dead-end street, please use the on-street parking on North Ave. There is a camera in the cache to include a photo log entry if you want to; during the colder months please bring two AA batteries if you plan to use the camera, as it will likely be dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The End of the Road also signifies the end of an era when in the early 70's Interstate highway construction began to be opposed by neighbors, environmentalists, cities and towns alike. Interstate 295 was never fully completed due to this change of attitude and terminates rather abruptly at Interstate 95. I-295 was originally planned to extend into Attleboro and terminate somewhere on Route 152 (Pleasant St.) near Lindsey St where there would be a link to Interstate 895. 895 was planned to be the eastern beltway around Providence extending down to Newport and the Jamestown Verazzano Bridge. However, the bridge itself was the only section of 895 that was built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this cache is TRAVELING. Please add trinkets that are at least from outside of New England, international trinkets are even better.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Old Smokey cache is located in the vicinity a very old fire-gutted house, across the field the railroad tracks that carry Amtrak and Commuter Rail between Boston and Providence can be seen. The cache is a traditional ammo box. The Old Smokey cache is easily accessible from many different approaches. Several of the approaches pass through naturally wet areas, therefore I recommend water-proof boots in the Spring and after moderate rain fall. The easiest approach would be parking on Richardson Ave. and hiking down the dirt road to the train tracks, however it is also possible to approach from Lindsey St. by hiking down the powerlines road, but this would be a do-able but significantly longer hike.  This hike is certainly available in the winter, but the cache will be very hard to find if there is snow on the ground.  Near the house there is a lot of tall grass, bug repellent is highly recommended during tick season.</groundspeak:long_description>

It's hard to remember individually at this point each cache, but we enjoyed it quite a bit.  As an Eagle Scout myself (1998) I appreciate the theme.  From reading the merit badge requirements, it seems like they were easier back in my day!  Great locations, and a lovely tour.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;To find this cache you will have needed to find all 15 of the
other caches in the series (see bookmark list).&lt;br /&gt;
At each of those caches you will find information needed to find
this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you find this cache you will find a scouting souvenir,
these scouting related items are &lt;b&gt;GIFTS&lt;/b&gt;, you do not need to
trade for them if you don't have anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to earn the Eagle Scout rank a scout must:&lt;br /&gt;
-Earn 21 merit badges including the 15 in this series,&lt;br /&gt;
-Progress through all the previous ranks each of which has it's own
set of requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
-Serve a minimum of six months in a leadership position&lt;br /&gt;
-Plan, organize, and lead other scouts in an approved service
project which benefits the community.&lt;br /&gt;
-Pass an Eagle board of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates take all the numbers from the other
caches and add them together, you should get a 10 digit number.
Take that number and input those numbers in the same order in the
blanks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 42 ___ ___ . ___ ___ ___ W 071 ___ ___ . ___ ___ ___&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXAMPLE: 1234567890 would be: N 42 &lt;b&gt;1 2
. 3 4 5&lt;/b&gt; W 071 &lt;b&gt;6 7 . 8 9
0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This project was carried out by a member of&lt;br /&gt;Troop 73 Holliston. This project involved building a bridge and&lt;br /&gt;benches for people to enjoy Weston Pond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This area has become a little overgrown in the years since the&lt;br /&gt;project was done, there are lots of thorn bushes so long pants and&lt;br /&gt;long sleeves are strongly suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 6/11/10:&lt;/b&gt; Due to some SERIOUS damage to the Island and&lt;br /&gt;the access from the recent storms, I have moved this cache off the&lt;br /&gt;Island. It is now located near the bridge over but you no longer&lt;br /&gt;have to go onto the island.

Prepare it for inspection using a&lt;br /&gt;bicycle safety checklist. Be sure the bicycle meets local&lt;br /&gt;laws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show your bicycle to your counselor for inspection. Point out&lt;br /&gt;the adjustments or repairs you have made.

You must&lt;br /&gt;make a report of the rides taken. List dates, routes traveled, and&lt;br /&gt;interesting things seen.*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;After fulfilling requirement 8, lay out on a road map a 50-mile&lt;br /&gt;trip. Stay away from main highways. Using your map, make this ride&lt;br /&gt;in eight hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The bicycle must have all required safety features. It must be&lt;br /&gt;registered as required by your local traffic laws.</groundspeak:long_description>

discuss this with your parents or guardians and with your merit
badge counselor.&lt;/li&gt;

each of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the approval of your parents or guardians and your merit
badge counselor, decide on and carry out a project that you would
do around the home that would benefit your family. Submit a report
to your merit badge counselor outlining how the project benefited
your family.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The objective or goal of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How individual members of your family participated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The results of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss with your merit badge counselor how to plan and carry
out a family meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After this discussion, plan and carry out a family meeting to
include the following subjects:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding substance abuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the growing-up process and how the body changes,
and making responsible decisions dealing with sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal and family finances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A crisis situation within your family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effects of technology on your family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss the following with your counselor:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your understanding of what makes an effective father and why,
and your thoughts on the father's role in the family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your understanding of the responsibilities of a parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

An Eagle scout&lt;br /&gt;from Troop 73 Holliston (now more commonly known as Mooney625)&lt;br /&gt;organized a massive clean-up and created a fund to maintain the&lt;br /&gt;cemetery in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is not actually at the cemetery. I felt there was no&lt;br /&gt;appropriate place at the cemetery itself so the cache is place at&lt;br /&gt;the entrance to the conservation area.

Discuss the rights, duties, and obligations of&lt;br /&gt;citizenship, and explain how you can demonstrate good citizenship&lt;br /&gt;in your community, Scouting unit, place of worship or&lt;br /&gt;school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a map of your community, locate and point out&lt;br /&gt;the following:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chief government buildings such as your city&lt;br /&gt;hall, county courthouse, and public works/services&lt;br /&gt;facility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fire station, police station, and hospital nearest your&lt;br /&gt;home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Historical or other interesting points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chart the organization of your local or state government.

Tell your counselor why these services are important to&lt;br /&gt;your community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the&lt;br /&gt;following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose a&lt;br /&gt;charitable organization outside of Scouting that interests you and&lt;br /&gt;brings people in your community together to work for the good of&lt;br /&gt;your community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using a variety of&lt;br /&gt;resources (including newspapers, fliers and other literature, the&lt;br /&gt;Internet, volunteers, and employees of the organization), find out&lt;br /&gt;more about this organization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;With your&lt;br /&gt;counselor's and your parent's approval, contact the organization&lt;br /&gt;and find out what young people can do to help. While working on&lt;br /&gt;this merit badge, volunteer at least eight hours of your time for&lt;br /&gt;the organization. After your volunteer experience is over, discuss&lt;br /&gt;what you have learned with your&lt;br /&gt;counselor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a public&lt;br /&gt;presentation (such as a video, slide show, speech, digital&lt;br /&gt;presentation, or photo exhibit) about important and unique aspects&lt;br /&gt;of your community. Include information about the history, cultures,&lt;br /&gt;and ethnic groups of your community; its best features and popular&lt;br /&gt;places where people gather; and the challenges it faces. Stage your&lt;br /&gt;presentation in front of your merit badge counselor or a group,&lt;br /&gt;such as your patrol or a class at school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Actual cemetery&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 11.288 W 071° 28.293&lt;br /&gt;This is the cemetery that was worked on down the street.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An Eagle scout from Troop 73 Holliston
organized and carried out a project that involved Clearing trails,
and creating a camping area at the pond in the Brentwood area in
Holliston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to earn the Eagle Scout rank a scout must:&lt;br /&gt;
-Earn 21 merit badges including the 15 in this series,&lt;br /&gt;
-Progress through all the previous ranks each of which has it's own
set of requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
-Serve a minimum of six months in a leadership position&lt;br /&gt;
-Plan, organize, and lead other scouts in an approved service
project which benefits the community.&lt;br /&gt;
-Pass an Eagle board of review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SWIMMING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss the prevention and treatment for health concerns that
could occur while swimming, including hypothermia, dehydration,
sunburn, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, muscle cramps,
hyperventilation, spinal injury, stings and bites, and cuts and
scrapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the conditions that must exist before performing CPR
on a person. Explain how to recognize such conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate proper technique for performing CPR using a
training device approved by your counselor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell what precautions must be taken for a safe swim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate your ability to jump feetfirst into water over your
head in depth, level off and swim 25 feet on the surface, stop,
turn sharply, resume swimming, then return to your starting
place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate water rescue methods by reaching with your arm or
leg, reaching with a suitable object, and by throwing lines and
objects. Explain why swimming rescues should not be attempted when
a reaching or throwing rescue is possible, and explain why and how
a rescue swimmer should avoid contact with the victim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell what precautions should be taken for a safe trip
afloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;successfully complete the BSA swimmer test. Jump feet first
into water over your head in depth, swim 75 yards in a strong
manner using one or more of the following strokes: sidestroke,
breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards using an easy,
resting backstroke. The 100 yards must be swum continuously and
include at least one sharp turn. After completing the swim, rest by
floating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a helper and a practice victim, show a line rescue both as
tender and as rescuer. (The practice victim should be approximately
30 feet from shore in deep water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate survival skills by jumping feetfirst into deep
water wearing clothes (shoes, socks, swim trunks, long pants, belt,
and long-sleeved shirt). Remove shoes and socks, inflate the shirt,
and show that you can float using the shirt for support. Remove and
inflate the pants for support. Swim 50 feet using the inflated
pants for support, then show how to reinflate the pants while still
afloat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swim continuously for 150 yards using the following strokes in
good form and in a strong manner: front crawl or trudgen for 25
yards, back crawl for 25 yards, sidestroke for 25 yards,
breaststroke for 25 yards, and elementary backstroke for 50
yards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Float faceup in a resting position for at least one
minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate survival floating for at least five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While wearing a properly fitted personal floatation device
(PFD), demonstrate the HELP and huddle positions. Explain their
purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why swimming or survival floating will hasten the onset
of hypothermia in cold water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In water over your head, but not to exceed 10 feet, do each of
the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the feetfirst method of surface diving and bring an object
up from the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a headfirst surface dive (pike or tuck), and bring the
object up again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a headfirst surface dive to a depth of at least 5 feet and
swim underwater for three strokes. Come to the surface, take a
breath, and repeat the sequence twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do ONE of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate selection and fit of mask, snorkel, and fins;
discuss safety in both pool and open-water snorkeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate proper use of mask, snorkel, and fins for
underwater search and rescue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the sport of scuba diving or snorkeling, and
demonstrate your knowledge of BSA policies and procedures relating
to that sport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racing dive from a pool edge or dock edge (no elevated dives
from racing platforms or starting blocks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racing form for 25 yards on one competitive stroke (front
crawl, back crawl, breaststroke, or butterfly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Racing turns for the stroke that you chose in 8b(2), OR, if the
camp facilities cannot accommodate the racing turn, repeat 8b(2)
with and additional stroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the sport of competitive swimming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the guidelines set in the BSA Safe Swim Defense, in
water at least 7 feet deep, show a standing headfirst dive from a
dock or pool deck. Show a long shallow dive, also from the dock or
pool deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain the health benefits of regular aerobic exercise, and
explain why many people today do not get enough of the beneficial
kinds of exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss why swimming is favored as both a fitness and a
therapeutic exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a plan for a swimming exercise program that will promote
aerobic/vascular fitness, strength and muscle tone, body
flexibility, and weight control for a person of Scout age. Identify
resources and facilities available in your home community that
would be needed for such a program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss with your counselor the incentives and obstacles for
staying with the fitness program you created in requirement 10c.
Explain the unique benefits that could be gained from this program,
and discuss how personal health awareness and self discipline would
relate to your own willingness and ability to pursue such a
program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Prepare a 100-word report about the organism,&lt;br /&gt;including a drawing. Present your report to your patrol or&lt;br /&gt;troop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;B-&lt;/b&gt;Do research on one species that was endangered or&lt;br /&gt;threatened but which has now recovered. Find out how the organism&lt;br /&gt;recovered, and what its new status is. Write a 100-word report on&lt;br /&gt;the species and discuss it with your counselor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-&lt;/b&gt;With your parent's and counselor's approval, work with a&lt;br /&gt;natural resource professional to identify two projects that have&lt;br /&gt;been approved to improve the habitat for a threatened or endangered&lt;br /&gt;species in your area. Visit the site of one of these projects and&lt;br /&gt;report on what you saw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pollution Prevention, Resource Recovery, and Conservation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A-&lt;/b&gt;Look around your home and determine 10 ways your family&lt;br /&gt;can help reduce pollution. Practice at least two of these methods&lt;br /&gt;for seven days and discuss with your counselor what you have&lt;br /&gt;learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;B-&lt;/b&gt;Determine 10 ways to conserve resources or use resources&lt;br /&gt;more efficiently in your home, at school, or at camp. Practice at&lt;br /&gt;least two of these methods for seven days and discuss with your&lt;br /&gt;counselor what you have learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-&lt;/b&gt;Perform an experiment on packaging materials to find out&lt;br /&gt;which ones are biodegradable. Discuss your conclusions with your&lt;br /&gt;counselor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose two outdoor study areas that are very different from one&lt;br /&gt;another (e.g., hilltop vs. bottom of a hill; field vs. forest;&lt;br /&gt;swamp vs. dry land). For BOTH study areas, do ONE of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark off a plot of 4 square yards in each study area, and count&lt;br /&gt;the number of species found there. Estimate how much space is&lt;br /&gt;occupied by each plant species and the type and number of nonplant&lt;br /&gt;species you find. Write a report that adequately discusses the&lt;br /&gt;biodiversity and population density of these study areas. Discuss&lt;br /&gt;your report with your counselor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make at least three visits to each of the two study areas (for&lt;br /&gt;a total of six visits), staying for at least 20 minutes each time,&lt;br /&gt;to observe the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Space&lt;br /&gt;each visit far enough apart that there are readily apparent&lt;br /&gt;differences in the observations. Keep a journal that includes the&lt;br /&gt;differences you observe. Then, write a short report that adequately&lt;br /&gt;addresses your observations, including how the differences of the&lt;br /&gt;study areas might relate to the differences noted, and discuss this&lt;br /&gt;with your counselor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the construction project provided or a plan you create on&lt;br /&gt;your own, identify the items that would need to be included in an&lt;br /&gt;environmental impact statement for the project planned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;6. Find out about three career opportunities in environmental&lt;br /&gt;science. Pick one and find out the education, training, and&lt;br /&gt;experience required for this profession. Discuss this with your&lt;br /&gt;counselor, and explain why this profession might interest you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Emergency!&quot; ABOUT THE PRODUCTION &quot;To suffer fifty weeks of the
year for the sake of a two-week vacation; it's a measly manner of
existence.&quot; These are the feelings expressed by a character in
Arthur Miller's mult-award winning play, &quot;Death of a Salesman.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, members of paramedics emergency rescue teams don't
feel this way, for they know that they are members of an exciting,
rewarding, although sometimes dangerous, profession. Their way of
life constitutes the main strength of Universal Television's
hour-long series &quot;Emergency!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has &quot;Emergency!&quot; proven successful and popular
television viewing, it's graphic illustration of society's need for
trained paramedics, has in the words of Senator Alan Cranston
&quot;...alerted the public to the value of paramedic for better
emergency care.&quot; In September, 1972, the Senator wrote to Jack
Webb, who produced the series to say... &quot;We unanimously passed a
bill that, among other things would promote the training of
paramedics to staff ambulances and emergency rooms in hospitals
across the country. I introduced the provisions in the bill dealing
with paramedics and emergency medical services in hopes that our
nation will make greater use of the thousands of experienced, able
young men who have returned from Vietnam with the medical skills
America needs so desperately. They are to get top priority in the
training programs. Jack, your &quot;EMERGENCY!&quot; series fired the public
imagination and was the harbinger for a medical idea whose time, I
believe, has come. In the midst of a severe shortage of doctors,
nurses and trained emergency personnel, 175,000 die each year
because they do not get adequate medical care in an emergency.
Another 25,000 are left permanently disabled because of inept
handling by untrained ambulance attendants. &quot;EMERGENCY!&quot; has
dramatized the potential of the paramedic. I hope the House of
Representatives and the President will now follow the lead of 100
Senators -- and Jack Webb! Thank you for the good work, Jack. And
congratulations to you and all the people connected with
&quot;EMERGENCY!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background of &quot;Emergency!&quot; as a television series is the
true story of a project that began in Los Angeles in 1969, the year
that launched a specially trained team of highly skilled
firemen-paramedics to operate rescue squads for the L.A. County
Fire Department.&lt;br /&gt;
Although many fire departments traditionally have provided rescue
service to aid the injured, sick and dying, it was obvious to many
civic officials and medical personnel that too many patients were
being lost before they could receive trained medical aid at the
hospital. The initial program to alleviate this waste of life was
inaugurated, funded by the federal and county governments.&lt;br /&gt;
In pairs, the firefighters went with doctors on their daily
hospital rounds, checking vital signs, taking blood pressure
readings, interpreting electrocardiograms. They performed as
&quot;student medical assistants&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Afternoons were spent in the classrooms, where the firemen and a
score of registered nurses qualified to become Cardiac Care Unit
Specialist. Three short months later, the firemen were in the
fields, able to put their newly acquired knowledge to use with the
aid of sophisticated, and expensive, mobile equipment which was
added to the conventional rescue squad trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first year, a nurse accompanied the paramedics on all
calls because there was no legal authority for the firemen to
perform the advanced techniques they had learned. Then, the
Wedworth-Townsend Act was passed by the California State
Legislature and the paramedic program was off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Webb has been blazing new trails in dramatic programs for
more than 20 years. He filmed &quot;Emergency!&quot; with the full
cooperation and assistance of the Los Angeles County Fire
Department as well as the County Department of Hospitals. Adding a
decidedly realistic touch, authentic fire-fighting equipment has
been loaned to the production company. Should any of it be needed
in an actual crisis, a &quot;hot line&quot; links fire department
headquarters to the sound stage. One ring on that instrument,
appropriately painted fire engine red, and film production becomes
secondary to the needs of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for the Puzzle:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the coordinates you must find the answers to the
following questions. I was able to get them all with a little bit
of searching on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC = The actual firestation number used as the model for the
series&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DE = The number of the &quot;Squad&quot; (Paramedic response vehicle) in
the TV Show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FGH = This one takes a little work:&lt;br /&gt;
Johnny's badge number&lt;br /&gt;
- Roy's badge number&lt;br /&gt;
+ Last two digits of the year when the show premiered&lt;br /&gt;
+ 20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IJ = The last two digits of the year when the final show (NOT
movie specials) aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a 1 liter jug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coords are: N42 AB.CDE W071 FG.HIJ&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was a big fan of the show and enjoyed the well-designed hide. As we walked toward the cache, we encountered a lot of industrial debris. OleSeeker, who had found the cache back last May, hadn't remembered it being there. As we passed through it, we noticed the fire line tape. Apparently there was a fire in the building adjacent to the trail and the debris has not been removed. I didn't notice any dangerous conditions or hazardous debris... but be alert as you step. TFTC

Upon&lt;br /&gt;placement of the cache it looks like the benches that were placed&lt;br /&gt;have mysteriously disappeared. Also across the street another Eagle&lt;br /&gt;project was to build the new scoreboard for Flagg&lt;br /&gt;Field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to earn the Eagle Scout rank a scout must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Earn 21 merit badges including the 15 in this series,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Progress through all the previous ranks each of which has it's own&lt;br /&gt;set of requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Serve a minimum of six months in a leadership position&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Plan, organize, and lead other scouts in an approved service&lt;br /&gt;project which benefits the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pass an Eagle board of review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LIFESAVING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the following:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell what precautions must be taken for a safe swim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate your ability to jump feetfirst into water over your&lt;br /&gt;head in depth, level off and swim 25 feet on the surface, stop,&lt;br /&gt;turn sharply, resume swimming, then return to your starting&lt;br /&gt;place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate water rescue methods by reaching with your arm or&lt;br /&gt;leg, reaching with a suitable object, and by throwing lines and&lt;br /&gt;objects.

We made a quick find, swapped coins and then realized that this cache and the other we had found earlier were part of a series where taking notes would prove helpful. Dropped AMTG Virtual Team Alamo 2007 Spinning GC and retrieved Lapporten. TFTC

It's hard to remember individually at this point each cache, but we enjoyed it quite a bit.  As an Eagle Scout myself (1998) I appreciate the theme.  From reading the merit badge requirements, it seems like they were easier back in my day!  Great locations, and a lovely tour.</groundspeak:text>

This was an Eagle Scout project by a member of&lt;br /&gt;Troop 73 Holliston.&lt;/b&gt; Please use trailhead (see waypoint)&lt;br /&gt;and respect the historical society by not bushwhacking across their&lt;br /&gt;property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to earn the Eagle Scout rank a scout&lt;br /&gt;must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Earn 21 merit badges including the 15 in this series,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Progress through all the previous ranks each of which has it's own&lt;br /&gt;set of requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Serve a minimum of six months in a leadership position&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Plan, organize, and lead other scouts in an approved service&lt;br /&gt;project which benefits the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pass an Eagle board of review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;COMMUNICATIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do ONE of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;For one day, keep a log in which you describe&lt;br /&gt;your communication activities. Keep track of the time and different&lt;br /&gt;ways you spend communicating, such as talking person-to-person,&lt;br /&gt;listening to your teachers or the radio, watching television,&lt;br /&gt;reading books, and other print media, and communicating online.&lt;br /&gt;Discuss with your counselor what your log reveals about the&lt;br /&gt;importance of communication in your life. Think of ways to improve&lt;br /&gt;your communications skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;For three days, keep a journal of your listening&lt;br /&gt;experiences. Identify one example of each of the following, and&lt;br /&gt;discuss with your counselor when you have listened to:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obtain information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A persuasive argument&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appreciate or enjoy something&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand someone's feelings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a small-group setting, meet with other scouts&lt;br /&gt;or with friends. Have them share personal stories about significant&lt;br /&gt;events in their lives that affected them in some way. Take note of&lt;br /&gt;how each scout participates in the group discussion and how&lt;br /&gt;effective each one is in telling his story. Report what you have&lt;br /&gt;learned to your counselor about the differences you observed in&lt;br /&gt;effective communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;List as many ways as you can think of to&lt;br /&gt;communicate with others (face-to-face, by telephone, letter,&lt;br /&gt;e-mail, fax). For each type of communication discuss with your&lt;br /&gt;counselor an instance when that method might not be appropriate or&lt;br /&gt;effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do ONE of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think of a creative way to describe yourself,&lt;br /&gt;using, for example, a collage, short story or autobiography,&lt;br /&gt;drawing or series of photographs, or a song or skit. Using the aid&lt;br /&gt;you created, make a presentation to your counselor about&lt;br /&gt;yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose a concept, product, or service in which&lt;br /&gt;you have great confidence. Build a sales plan based on its good&lt;br /&gt;points. Try to persuade the counselor to agree with, use, or buy&lt;br /&gt;your concept, product or service. After your sales talk, discuss&lt;br /&gt;with your counselor how persuasive you were.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write a five-minute speech. Give it at a meeting&lt;br /&gt;of a group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interview someone you know fairly well, like, or&lt;br /&gt;respect because of his or her position, talent, career or life&lt;br /&gt;experiences. Listen actively to learn as much as you can about the&lt;br /&gt;person. Then prepare and deliver to your counselor an introduction&lt;br /&gt;of the person as though this person were to be a guest speaker, and&lt;br /&gt;include reasons why the audience would want to hear this person&lt;br /&gt;speak. Show how you would call to invite this person to&lt;br /&gt;speak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attend a public meeting (city council, school&lt;br /&gt;board, debate) approved by your counselor where several points of&lt;br /&gt;view are given on a single issue. Practice active listening skills&lt;br /&gt;and take careful notes of each point of view. Present an objective&lt;br /&gt;report that includes all points of view that were expressed, and&lt;br /&gt;share this with your counselor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;With your counselor's approval, develop a plan&lt;br /&gt;to teach a skill or inform someone about something. Prepare&lt;br /&gt;teaching aids for your plan. Carry out your plan. With your&lt;br /&gt;counselor, determine whether the person has learned what you&lt;br /&gt;intended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do ONE of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write to the editor of a magazine or your local&lt;br /&gt;newspaper to express your opinion or share information on any&lt;br /&gt;subject you choose. Send your message by fax, email or regular&lt;br /&gt;mail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a Web page for your scout troop, school,&lt;br /&gt;or other organization. Include at least one article and one&lt;br /&gt;photograph or illustration, and one link to some other web page&lt;br /&gt;that would be helpful to someone who visits the web page you have&lt;br /&gt;created. It is not necessary to post your web page to the internet,&lt;br /&gt;but if you decide to do so, you must first share it with your&lt;br /&gt;parents and counselor and get their permission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use desktop publishing to produce a newsletter,&lt;br /&gt;brochure, flier or other printed material for your scout troop,&lt;br /&gt;class at school, or other group. Include at least one article and&lt;br /&gt;one photograph or illustration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plan a troop court of honor or campfire program.&lt;br /&gt;Have the patrol leaders' council approve it, then write the script&lt;br /&gt;and prepare the program.

Find out where you can buy the&lt;br /&gt;item for the best price. (Provide prices from at least two&lt;br /&gt;different price sources.) Call around; study ads. Look for a sale&lt;br /&gt;or discount coupon. Consider alternatives. Can you buy the item&lt;br /&gt;used?

Track your actual income,&lt;br /&gt;expenses, and savings for 13 consecutive weeks. (You may use the&lt;br /&gt;forms provided in this pamphlet, devise your own, or use a computer&lt;br /&gt;generated version.)

This is a project on paper, not a&lt;br /&gt;real-life project. Examples could include planning a camping trip,&lt;br /&gt;developing a community service project or a school or religious&lt;br /&gt;event, or creating an annual patrol plan with additional activities&lt;br /&gt;not already included in the troop annual plan. Discuss your&lt;br /&gt;completed project plan with your merit badge counselor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define the project. What is your goal?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a timeline for your project that shows the steps you&lt;br /&gt;must take from beginning to completion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe your project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a list of resources. Identify how these resources will&lt;br /&gt;help you achieve your goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If necessary, develop a budget for your project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose a career you might want to enter after high school or&lt;br /&gt;college graduation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research the limitations of your anticipated career and discuss&lt;br /&gt;with your merit badge counselor what you have learned about&lt;br /&gt;qualifications such as education, skills, and experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We had not read the cache page which answers that question. Returning today to complete some other unfinished cache business further south, I decided that we should stop and give it a quick look. Ole and I found and logged the cache but enjoyed the scenery and the wildlife even more. What a surprise to find such a pleasant spot hidden behind the business district. Being the driver, Ole opted to make a quick return later for some relevant information while I refreshed my iced coffee at the local donut shop. TFTC

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This Cache will take you on a short walk around a small
forgotten and neglected piece of Town Forest. Due to tree cover the
GPS was bouncing around so the coordinates will get you pretty
close but you will have to work to find some of them. All stages
are within 15 feet of the trails so you can stay on them. There is
a very rough map at the parking area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was feeling devious and decided to place this 7 PART multi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each stage is placed differently.&lt;br /&gt;
ALL stages use the same first digits, so at each stage you will
only find the LAST 3 North and last 3 West digits for the next
stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The listed coordinates are for stage 1 AND parking, there should be
enough parking for 5 or 6 cars but the entrance from the road is
small and if you blink you will miss it. The parking area is also a
little rough, although the average car should be fine any
exceptionally low vehicle may not make it and you will have to park
on side of road and walk in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The final is in a well camouflaged medium pill container so it will
only contain a log sheet and room for some small stuff but not
coins or trackables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am starting it off as Premium Member cache but will open it up
after a short time. Since people seem to have trouble with stage 6
there is a little hint for that one. Stage 6 is NOT near the house
as stated previously all stages are 0 to 15 feet from trail, if you
are going further than that you have poor GPS reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not recommended at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Seekerjay for
FTF!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The History of Henry Warren
&lt;p&gt;HENRY WARREN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not recognize Henry Ellis Warren's name, but you
probably have one of his 135 inventions in your home, an electric
clock! Today, The Warren Conference Center &amp; Inn is situated on
the land that Henry Warren and his wife Edith donated to
Northeastern University after their prosperous foray into the
business world. Born in Boston on May 21, 1872, Henry started a
life which would be devoted to philanthropy and his passion for
innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the young age of eight, Henry (nicknamed Harry because his
father was also named Henry) moved to Newton Centre with his family
in 1880. Along with his father, mother, and sister Louise, Henry's
grandfather, Rowland Ellis, lived with him. Rowland, whose family
were friends with Paul Revere, taught young Henry how to use
workshop tools, inevitably sparking his life long passion for
invention and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry had a rich and happy childhood. In 1884 he entered the
Allen School, which had been founded by Horace Mann and was
directed by Nathaniel Allen and his brother. His father, a wool
merchant, and his mother, a loving and devoted housewife, doted on
Henry, now an only child since his sister's death the same year he
entered the Allen School. Henry's parents saw the love of building
things that his grandfather had instilled in him and so built a
small experimental laboratory in their home for Henry to tinker in.
It was here that Henry made one of his first mechanical inventions,
an automated chicken coup! Like any small child, Henry had chores,
and one in particular chore in the wintertime made him cringe with
cold. Instead of going outside to feed their chickens in the frigid
New England weather, he rigged up an old lard pail filled with
chicken feed in the coup, strung wires to his bedroom, attached
some batteries and, after several weeks of experimenting, was able
to empty the pail in the chicken house by pressing a button near
the head of his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Homer's father that introduced Henry to the business
world as a place that could profit from his inventions. Homer and
Henry were given the job of helping the ailing business of the
Saginaw Valley Traction Company, an electric street railway powered
by steam. Homer tackled the problem of a lack of customers by
building an amusement park on the outskirts of town at the end of
the trolley line and Henry saw an opportunity for the surplus steam
that was being generated and wasted. He piped the steam underground
to deposits of salt which melted the salt and the pressure used to
force the steam underground forced the salty mixture up to the
surface where it could be processed. The company was saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in Ashland&lt;br /&gt;
Ashland finally became the home of Henry in 1904 when he moved
there with Homer with their new company, The Lombard Governor
Company of Boston. At this point Ashland was facing economic crisis
with the mills being closed and people out of work. Henry, with
Edith decided to make their home there despite the economic
hardship. They chose a picturesque farm on a hill overlooking their
tiny town of Ashland, 25 miles away from the city of Boston.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was on this farm, Henry named it Upland, that he designed his
135 patents and built his famous inventions. The red barn, still on
the property and used by The Warren Conference Center &amp; Inn
today, was his workshop which became the home of his business, the
Warren Gear Works. It was here, after taking his morning
constitutional through his apple orchards and woods beyond, that
Henry worked on his inventions. Henry designed plans for machinery
with better gears and experimented with clocks. Thanks to Henry's
ingenuity, he built a clock that actually ran on batteries, the
first of its kind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clock work&lt;br /&gt;
Things only snowballed from there and Henry became a leader in the
industry of horology (time keeping). The business of gears was left
behind and he devoted all of his innovative skills to creating more
accurate clocks. Henry moved his workshop into an idle building at
the Lombard Governor Company plant where the production of
battery-powered clocks were produced on a commercial scale. Though
these clocks were popular, they were expensive and delicate. It
took ten years for Henry to be satisfied with his new design, run
by power plants, to enhance these clocks but he did it in 1916 by
inventing a small, self-starting synchronous motor to run on
alternating current that would be suitable for operating clocks and
instruments. The motor was designed to rotate in perfect step with
the current impulses as delivered by alternating electric current.
Unfortunately the frequency of electric impulses varied from power
plant to power plant. Henry didn't let this discourage him though.
In 1916 Henry devised the first master clock, which made it
possible to control the frequency of electric current with split
second-accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motor of the master clock weighed less than a pound but was
capable of carrying the load of a gear train to move the hands of a
clock with ease. Henry's new invention caught the eye of the well
known company, General Electric (GE) in 1917 when they purchased
half interest in the Warren Company. In 1943 they bought full
ownership. In early 1979 the Timex Corporation purchased the Warren
Company from GE. Clocks and timers were made under the Timex name
and motors were made under the Telechron name for OEM (original
equipment manufacturer) sales. In 1983, a group consisting of the
Senior Plant Management Staff bought the plant and directed the
work toward OEM motors and appliance timers, taking the emphasis
away from clocks. The name became Telechron, Inc. The company is
still producing wall clocks today, both AC line and battery powered
under the Telechron name. Henry, always one to be creative, decided
on the trade name of &quot;Telechron&quot; for his products in 1923. The
words' Greek meaning is &quot;time from a distance.&quot; Today , the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. houses a Warren master
clock in its collection however, the clock is no longer on view.
Or, you can visit The Warren Conference Center &amp; Inn where we
proudly showcase Telechron clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Life&lt;br /&gt;
Henry brought prosperity to the hometown that he loved. During the
years between 1927 to 1937 The Warren Telechron Company, with the
help of GE, constructed a new factory in Ashland for the production
of Telechron clocks, motors, and timing instruments. Henry retired
in 1943 when GE bought full ownership but his profound effect on
people's lives didn't start or end there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry was interested in public service which led him to become
Chairman of the Ashland Selectmen from 1907 to 1909. From 1910 to
1917 he was Chairman of the Water Commissioners (and largely
responsible for forming a public water system), Chairman for the
Town Forest Committee from 1937, and trustee and then President of
the Middlesex County Extension in Agriculture and Home Economics
from 1936 to 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry, a devoted Sunday School teacher, was also very concerned
with the youth of his day. He fought for and won a decision to use
15 acres of land in Ashland for a park for children and their
parents which is still in use today and called Stone Park. Henry
was also a trustee for the Salvation Army and the Framingham Union
Hospital. In 1927 Henry worked to establish the Algonquin Council
of the Boy Scouts and was made an adult member of the Boy Scouts of
America December 31, 1930. From Henry's estate, the Warren
Benevolent Fund was established, mostly for scholarship aid to the
students of Ashland.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 4/30/09: Due to the numerous e-mails from people
regarding stage 1 I am going to just come out and say that the
coordinates are right out in&lt;/p&gt;

There were a few footprints at the final so I didn't expect an empty log but there it was...a blank log.  Thanks for the FTF prize. Dropped an Evil Micro geocoin to add a TB to the cache. It was interesting history and a very nice park I had never before visited. I will be back to visit the nearby caches. TFTC

On google maps it is not even listed by this name. Most people drive by this area hundreds of times but don't realize what is right around the corner.&lt;br/&gt;This is a very straight forward small traditional hidden near the boat launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a car top boat launch here for the Sudbury river, two baseball fields and batting cages. These fields are the home of the Ashland Little League.</groundspeak:long_description>

gives me a little chuckle every time i notice it. I have seen many
ways to protect the animals but for some reason I feel that the
method you see here is not going to help much.
&lt;p&gt;The cache is hidden just off the sidewalk at a small trail head.
This area is a high traffic area. In the winter you will be exposed
so stealth may be needed. There are no signs saying not to but I
would strongly advise not to park on the main roadway, there are
several business lots nearby including a very popular place for
coffee next to cache area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is in an easy hiding spot so it should not be too hard. It
is a medium sized L&amp;L covered in camo tape. I could only get 14
foot accuracy so the hint will help if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Leif Erikson recorded the cache's location using lodestone
compasses and sundials. The nearby tower commemorates the hide. The
name Norumbega may be derived from the local tongue - Nor [hidden];
Um [trinket]; Bega [food storage container].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;. . .or maybe not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The trickiest aspects of finding this cache will be, first, finding
Norumbega Road in the spaghetti-interchange at Routes 128 and 30
and the Mass Pike, and second, finding legal parking. Try parking
at the WCRB parking lot if you don't want to take your chances
parking on Norumbega Road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For business travellers, it's an easy 1.1 mile walk or drive
(map) from the Boston Marriott Newton Hotel to
the cache. Route 30 can get busy, so please be careful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Super-simplified driving directions&lt;/strong&gt; (thanks to
Team Spoonhead):&lt;br /&gt;
Take route 20 West from 128. Take second left onto Summer Street.
Follow Summer to end where it merges with River Road (approx. 1.5
miles). Turn left on River Road, go across route 128 and Norumbega
is first right. Cache area is less than a quarter mile down on
left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GPS reception can be spotty at times due to the contour of the hill
and the tree cover (and maybe the Viking dead protecting the
cache?). Trust your instincts.&lt;br /&gt;

When I got home decided to read up on the tower &amp; site. Wow..what an interesting story. Im going to have to go try and find the Leif Erikson granite plaque in Cambridge now!!

This was the first cache I ever went for. I got my GPS in the mail, put in the batteries and headed over on my bike. Well, not knowing how to work it, I spent 10 minutes riding from one end of the field to the other, because that was the way the arrow pointed. Went back a few days later, nothing. Came back with friends after a few more finds, still nothing. Then I decided to put it off for my 100th find. Well, I headed there a few months back, and again couldn't find it, I must have been cursed I thought, but then I deducted that it must have been missing. 
Thanks to Ghettomedic I finally got the chance to find it! It was soooo buggy as it has been every other time I've been there. A nice location though. TFTC!

My geo-partner (spurred on by Team Sogen's escapades no doubt) climbed the tower staircase while I made the find. Another very artistic camo job! TNLNSL.  We parked at the WCRB lot and found a path in from the bridge on South Street. It runs alongside the brook and brings you to the rear of the tower.

I thought for sure I knew what this hide was going to be so I looked around for the object that I thought CNC would use -- as it turned out I didn't find anything in the area I was looking for so I opened up the search for other containers.  I made the find although the superb CNC camo job made it a little more difficult than usual.  Checked out the tower and walked down to the river to look back over to the other side where I had been only minutes before (well almost, there's actually another finger of land between here and Spring Fling).  Grabbed a finder's pin.

This could be difficult in the snow. Difficulty upped a bit due to
all the DNFs.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It looks like you have to head up some stairs to get inside, but
couldn't there be another way? The difficulty is increased because
of how bumpy the coordinates can be.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo again!!! Your new cache maintainer here, proudly adopting this cache about a week ago! On this very warm (over 20°C/70F!!!) Easter Sunday morning, came to check on this one since a couple of DNFs after last visit, during an extended walk with my lovely two-legged &amp; furry four-legged assistants. Tons of muggles enjoying the beautiful day, some under the many full-bloom Cherry Blossoms along the Memorial Drive. Lucky, no one around GZ. Initially could not touch the cache, but used my camera with flash to scan the location. Sure enough, it was indeed there, just rolled out of it's intended spot. All good, so put it back. Please be very careful to return it exactly as you've found it for the next cacher to find. Maybe using your camera with flash to pre-scan, is the 'high-tech' way to find this one on Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. ;) SL &amp; dropped inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', for following finders', and for this cache's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. Once again, BIG thanks for the cache, MITApertureScience! Will do my best to keep this cache going! All Good to Go! Spring is Here! Come and Get it! Good Luck &amp; Cache On!</groundspeak:text>

Just yesterday, proudly adopted this very popular cache from the creator MITApertureScience, and needed to check on this cache ASAP. After work, took a slight detour, pahked cache-cah legally by the Charles River along the Memorial Drive, and made a short walk to replace a sister-cache nearby I also adopted from MITApertureScience. Nice &amp; warm evening as light is fading fast. Not many muggles on &amp; around MIT campus, luckily. Reached for the cache at GZ, though felt nothing. Took a picture, and confirmed the cache was indeed there, just couldn't get it. After some tries, finally had it in hand. Phew. All good inside, so SL and replaced it in a slightly easier place to retrieve. Truly, BIG thanks for the cache, MITApertureScience! Will do my best to keep this cache going! Good to go!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thanks, mate, for showing me that holy place: The MIT! I do work in that field, also with the connection to the academics - and hence I visited such a place from a totally different perspective! I walked around the institute, the professor's corridors just behind GZ (wished I had a room here). You are right, the gps signal is a bit bumpy - so was I looking for another court in the middle of the building. Went even down a level, to find that secret door to that secret court - 20m inside the building. A bit like the first Australian tourists were looking for the big sea in the center of their newly discovered continent...

Thanks MIT for the wireless guest net - could power up and read the clue. Well, I did look under that structure - but it was really in the last corner... Some students sitting inside their computer room behind the window - muggle - but certainly concentrated with chatting - or thinking?</groundspeak:text>

Took a long walk along the frozen Charles with my lovely two-legged and cute furry four-legged assistants. Less snow definitely helped, with previous hints, I got the grab. Many Muggles around taking pictures of the Great Dome. Met with two young MIT researchers in the middle of snow in front of the Great Dome, studying acoustics of the Violin's sound hole.

With several inches snow from the last Blizzard '09, this definitely was not good from the start. Just made a find in the area, so just wanted to check this out. Bada idea... Interestingly, though the log does not note any other recent DNFs, I saw many fairly new tracks on the snow, just only where you think you should be going to look for. I guess I'm not alone. No recent finds logged. Well, thanks for the nice view of the Great Dome, from very a different angle. I'll be back, once the snow has melted.</groundspeak:text>

After the success at Don't want to be a candidate, I returned here. After some more digging ( I had left the scene earlier the way I first found it), I finally had the logsheet in hand. It sometimes amazes me what some cachers will do for a smilie - even myself !  TFT Challenge but I am glad its done.

Well, after proudly adopting this popular cache on 2011/04/13, two
months later on 2011/06/07 it unfortunately became a 'candidate' to
be blown up by a water cannon...&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
After waiting for everything to cool down, just as the daily

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo again!!! Your new cache owner/maintainer here again! Just returned from Atlanta, GA, and I just couldn't resist the Men-an-Tol Pathtag left by owner pencoise for UK. Despite the early morning street cleaning, pahking was fine so put a quarter in for 15 minutes, and off the GZ. Darn, a City of Cambridge's Traffic department's van was pahked right next to GZ, with even two men inside. Did my cell-phone act while waiting for them to move. Precious 10 minutes passed, then a pahking meter fare-collector came walking down the street, and boarded the van. Sweet! Checking muggles from all directions, made the retrieve at last. Phew! All good &amp; dry. Still some small trinkets inside. Pick up the Pathtag, &amp; dropped inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', for following finders', and for the CO's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. Talking about bad timing, I did not know about the MIT dorm being evacuated nearby at that exact same time I was around, as the bomb squad 'disrupts' suspicious materials found inside the dorm using a water cannon. Good thing, it wasn't any of my adopted caches around MIT. All Good to Go! Summer is Here! Come and Get it! Good Luck &amp; Cache On!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo again!!! Your new cache owner/maintainer here again! Just about week ago, I proudly adopted this very popular cache from the creator MITApertureScience, and needed to replace the container with a new one, due to missing cap. Had to go to my lab (not this lab...) on this rainy Saturday morning, so took a slight detour, and pahked cache-cah legally right by GZ. Had to time my retrieval carefully due to muggle activity. Swapped out old one with my newly constructed replacement with brand new log booklet. Also dropped inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', for following finders', and for this cache's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. Once again, BIG thanks for the cache, MITApertureScience! Will do my best to keep this cache going!

Just a few days ago, I proudly adopted this very popular cache from the creator MITApertureScience, and needed to check on this cache ASAP. After work in the lab on this cloudy &amp; chilly Saturday evening, took a slight detour, and pahked cache-cah legally right opposite to GZ. Had to time my retrieval carefully. Turns out the cap is gone, unfortunately, yet the log was dry, so SL &amp; put it back for now. Will construct a replacement ASAP, yet it should be good to hunt for a while. Once replaced, will also update the hint a tiny bit, and complete the required 'Owner Maintenance'. Truly, BIG thanks for the cache, MITApertureScience! Will do my best to keep this cache going!

Similar story as in my previous cache 'Movin' on Up'; looked intp the spot but not deep enough; thanks to MIT again for free wireless! Ok, spotted - but my fingers weren't long enough! Little walk in well cleaned bushland - oops: garden - did not date to break the branches, so went a bit further where i found a little wire, stiff enough to push it out from the angled side... 

Big problem: Needs a new container - the logbook is lying bare in the place which may get wet now!</groundspeak:text>

On my way back from work, and after a DNF in Davis Sq., with a chilly low-hanging Wintery sky, with still few inches of snow on the ground left by Blizzard '09. Very few Muggles around. Great Hide! Because of construction in the area, the location may have changed a bit, but a flash light, and a little bit of &quot;Lift'n Shake&quot; did the job, thanks to the 'leader' attached. And, this is THE MIT Media Lab!!! Wow!!! Heard a lot about, and probably one can see the better future of our world to come! Awesome research! Go Science! Oh! And Happy Holidays! World Peace!

&lt;p&gt;The location is like a corn maze but with reeds and other river marsh growth canopying you in on all sides. Strangely there are lots of paths throughout, but to navigate I either recommend you be pretty small or are prepared to duck throughout. I'd also recommend long pants and a long shirt (maybe some protective eyewear as well)...though not required it may prevent some scratches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to make your own trail...one or many of the trails will take you to the cache. The cache is located at the end of the line of one of the trails exactly one foot off path. The coords should be super accurate, checked both once at night and once during day with both of my GPSr's, so if your in the right spot coord wise, you just have to look carefully at what's around....It sticks out in this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as always I'm not sure who hangs around this area at night (or day for that matter) so bringing a buddy is always recommended....but it sure is a fun spooky one to do at night by yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost forgot...tweezers would help with log extraction, but I wouldn't call this a micro however! &lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache and adventure will be a hot topic for caching stories for many months to come. I have been to the rainforest and the trek to this cache seemed more like that than the urban area nearby. Recent rains have added to the sea of green and the moisture content of the wetland. We came away &quot;drenched&quot;, almost as if we got caught in a downpour. Doublewe spotted the container which was not what we were expecting and then I extracted the moist log which is beginning to break apart. With some recent new caches placed close by, this area might soon be known as the place to find high thrill adventure.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo!!! Yeah, MV370F &amp; another box to fill-in my Difficulty/Terrain matrix! On this gloomy cool morning, had some time to spare, so came over to do the required maintenance for a Puzzle cache I 'Maintain' just across the Charles River. The very Puzzle cache that geo-friend &amp; CO Bumble! initially mislead himself to this location, just to find a unique labyrinth of Reeds. After finished with maintenance, left cache-cah at suggested lot, and crossed the bridge to the suggested trailhead. Well, the March Thaw thankfully cleared all the deep &amp; heavy snow, but what it left was a whole lot of dead lying reeds. I could barely see the paths, and the entire labyrinth was, well, just a bunch of reeds covering up the whole area. In fact, I myself felt quite exposed from the surroundings, though no one, not even the Northeastern University Huskies Men's Rowing team who were practicing up the Charles River nearby, seemed not to bother why I was there in this the very odd place. Now, where is it?! I did have an idea of what to look for, but when it came to where, the lying reeds were truly, Lord Of Illusions! After 20 minutes following my GPSr &amp; coming up with exactly nothing, desperately reached to my cell-phone &amp; called CO for a nudge. Actually, called him several times just to make clear what I was looking for &amp; where. Still nothing... One more desperate call to FTF-er and my best geo-buddy gw0143, and adding up all the information, I finally got myself to the 'where' location. Still, it took a while until I noticed the anomaly, and there was the cache! Yea! Great hide! The added protection might have helped a bit, yet the log was a little damp. My Inka Space Pen did a great job as usual. SL &amp; dipped inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', following finders', and CO's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. Phew! What a tough one, either reeds standing up or lying down! It took about an hour from going in &amp; coming out. Some advise: Good to bring some gardening gloves, and definitely need some sort of eye protection! Thanks Bumble! for the sneaky hide, for the nudges, and for bringing me here to this never-woulda-gone location! Oh, was that an anteater I saw in the reeds??? Cool! ;)</groundspeak:text>

Need space for a TB or two?&lt;br /&gt;
Please also visit my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=78899c82-30f8-4b2d-8701-db0a626e0274&quot;&gt;Return To Tradition #22: North Point Park&lt;/a&gt; cache
just across the Charles!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Must BYOP!!!&lt;br /&gt;
Good to bring your tweezers, too!&lt;br /&gt;
Please roll the log as tightly as possible!&lt;br /&gt;
And please return exactly where you've found it!&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;This is a Nano cache located in an area that I spend a lot of time
sitting and waiting while at work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an previous cache in the area that was lost to the
construction of this new park and the cache owners appear to have
given up the sport about a year ago so I felt that it would be nice
to have one here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this spot you get a nice relaxing view of the Charles River
and the Zakim Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this cache is good for folks visiting from out of town as
it is only a few short minutes walk from North Station / Boston
Garden, the Museum of Science, and Massachusetts General
Hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park does not seem to get too busy and the cache should be
easy to find, but beware of muggles anyway.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=4168976e-4567-4bcd-9bd1-13990aaa18ea&quot;&gt;revooh99&lt;/a&gt; FTF !!!&lt;/p&gt;

This crisp yet sunny early morning, extended my walk with my furry four-legged assistant to replace the log. The nearby Craigie Drawbridge is now undergoing total replacement, and the traffic around this area is quite chaotic. Look forward to seeing the new drawbridge next year, and roads back to normal as well. Cache-wise, All good now! Please roll the log as tight as possible, so it will fit inside the cap, not the magnetic bottom. Good idea to bring some tweezers. And of course, please BYOP, replace it exactly where you've found it, and do not cut the log short! Come &amp; Get it! Good Luck!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo!!! (= &quot;Howdy!&quot; in Japanese, FYI...) Your new adopted cache owner Dr.MORO here. First, much much thanks goes to GhettoMedic for starting &amp; maintaining this very highly visited cache, and also to his great generosity &amp; thoughtfulness of letting it be adopted! This is my very first cache to own, which in fact is my very 2nd find on 11/28/2009 last year, and this makes me feel a little more Geo-grownup, with now Found:103/Hidden:1, and growing. I will do my best to maintain the original 'color' of this one, as long as possible. To start off with, me &amp; my furry four-legged assistant took a walk to revisit this park &amp; cache on this puddle-freezing early morning with beautiful Blue sky. Great place! Awesome view! All is fine, cache &amp; log, coords &amp; hide. SO, come &amp; get it!</groundspeak:text>

Yeah!!! MV2F!!! (My Very Second Find!!!)
On a late chilly &amp; windy evening just before Sunset, without a GSPr. This nice small park is just across the river from where I walk my dog often, and have viewed it from the other side many times before. Quite a few skateboarding muggles in the distance, but else very quiet. First was occupied by a smoking muggle from Rehab, so strolled around a while with my trusty furry assistant. Didn't have a clear idea what to look for, but 'Nano' said it all! Very Tiny!
Took Nothing, Left Nothing, Signed Log (TNLNSL)!
Thanks For The Hide (TFTH)!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update 10/24/2010:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Renamed &amp; joined the wonderful
Bubba Riley Concept series!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Domo!!!「どーも！！！」
(Howdy! in Japanese)&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located close to my home, where me, my lovely
two-legged, and my furry four-legged assistants often go for a walk
&amp; play fetch. Quite popular, so you will probably meet at least
one muggle, BIG or small, two- or four-legged, enjoying this
park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've already adopted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c9c5f0fd-5722-400e-9259-3e500bdf9ce9&quot;&gt;my very first-to-own&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the
Charles River nearby and recently, but this one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/about/hiding.aspx&quot;&gt;my
very first-to-hide&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah! This is also placed to celebrate my
??th Birthday, and also the coincidently very close-by&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/lostandfound/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Tenth anniversary of Geocaching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After 'Discovering' my new hobby &quot;Geocaching&quot; last November of
2009, the way I look at this world has changed dramatically, and
ever since I have always been looking for a nice spot to hide a
'good sized' cache. Something like the Bubba Riley concept &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=e9c3ff55-b862-4ca6-9e8b-f4de9f7b67d4&quot;&gt;Return To Tradition #1: Burnt Out&lt;/a&gt; series:&lt;br /&gt;
Simply go to the coordinates listed on the page, and log your
find.&lt;br /&gt;
For a full list: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx?key=Return+to+Tradition&amp;amp;submit4=Go&quot;&gt;&quot;Return To Tradition&quot; series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SO&lt;/b&gt;, here it is! &lt;i&gt;Nice ‘n’ easy!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, this should be a nice 'introductory cache' for those who'd
like to join this amazing game!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On 10/24/2010, after over 100 Found logs, only 3 DNFs, nearly 100
TBs passing by, at least one CO visit per month, without being
'muggled' yet (BIG THANKS everyone!), I guess I can say it was a
very successful first 6 months. And through some discussions with
fellow cachers including the concept creator &amp; a few concept
followers, I have finally decided to rename this one, adding it as
the 22nd member, to greatly honor this wonderful concept
series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located within walking distance from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mos.org/&quot;&gt;Boston Museum of Science&lt;/a&gt;,
MBTA Green Line E branch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/default.asp?stopId=15675&quot;&gt;&quot;Lechmere (Accessible)&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/default.asp?stopId=15585&quot;&gt;&quot;Science Park (NOT Accessible)&quot;&lt;/a&gt; stations, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cambridgesidegalleria.com/&quot;&gt;Cambridgeside Galleria Mall&lt;/a&gt;. Street parking should
also be available within walking distance. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_P._Zakim_Bunker_Hill_Memorial_Bridge&quot;&gt;Zakim bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonducktours.com/duck_history_main.html&quot;&gt;DUKW&lt;/a&gt; landing/splashing can be seen if you go to the
East end of the park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Attribute notes:&lt;/b&gt; This location is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.handicaching.com/&quot;&gt;'Wheelchair
Accessible'&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;i&gt;unfortunately&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;u&gt;'helping hand'&lt;/u&gt;
will be required in order to retrieve the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, this park has a huge play area &amp; is 'Kid Friendly', but the
area around the cache has &lt;u&gt;no guard rails&lt;/u&gt;, so please keep a
good eye on kids!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Original cache contents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Three TBs [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?guid=64df9c9b-1669-4688-a945-456a1d879805&quot;&gt;Rozebud's Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?guid=1852a782-dc83-4e6b-8940-5490f6b76c9d&quot;&gt;One-Eyed Willy's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?guid=df956db8-b747-4d75-8ed0-16490e25807f&quot;&gt;GOLD BUICK # 3&lt;/a&gt;], Two Hand sanitizers, a Sushi
Eraser set, a Japanese Tea Ceremony Eraser set, a Super-ball, a
Smily Face Man, a Lunar 'CITO' astronaut, a glass fish, a CITO
sticker, logbook &amp; pen, and five of my signature Good Luck
&quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coins,
issued on the first year of the present Heisei
era「平成元年」(1989), for all
Geocacher's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional
information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;FTF prize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Goes to my best geo-buddy/Puzzle-master
&lt;b&gt;uciphd&lt;/b&gt;!!! Congrats!!!&lt;br /&gt;
A Japanese FTF dog tag (unfortunately non-trackable...),&lt;br /&gt;

「一番」&lt;br /&gt;
(= Number One, The First),&lt;br /&gt;
my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」
Japanese 5-Yen coin,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp; a scratch lottery ticket! Good Luck Winning!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, as always,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;br /&gt;
Watch out for muggles, BIG &amp; small, two- &amp; four-legged,
high &amp; low alike!&lt;br /&gt;
If you trade for items,&lt;br /&gt;
remember to trade for something that is of equal or greater
value.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;&lt;br /&gt;
Return the cache as you've found it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Good Luck &amp; Happy Caching!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;The World For The Lady&quot; (TB3ZQ73) is the very first Travel Bug I release, dedicated to the lovely time together we had on geocaching. I pledged to show the world to here - TB will start doing so!

Have to hurry to Sydney now....

This was our first visit to Boston and we were all a little bummed that being here meant that we had to be at Logan in just a few short hours to head back home on the west coast.
Thanks for luring us to this nice little waterfront park! dropped some swag and grabbed a couple of yens before heading off the walk the waterfront.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Since more and more caches were popping up along the Charles and the North End, I was motivated to take another bicycle trip through Boston. I parked the car at Paul Revere Park near the locks and OleSeeker and I headed out to the park from there. Although it was closeby, I93, the commuter rail tracks from North Station and a bend in the river prevented a direct shoreline route. We biked out to Rutherford Avenue, across the Gilmore Bridge and down Rt. 28 to the entrance to the park. Once there, there was a nice bikeway and a fine park to enjoy and explore. Ole found the cache while we searched a few spots. The cache was full of nice swag and several tbs for moving along. I dropped #8 TB and the Red Remembrance poppies geocoin and took

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A micro-tour between Cambridge and Charlestown.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You are visiting the North Bank Bridge, a newly constructed bicycle and pedestrian bridge, officially opened on 2012/07/13. It spans over the Millers River, four MBTA Commuter Rail tracks, and under the Interstate 93 (I-93)/U.S. Route 1 (US 1) of the Zakim Bridge, conveniently connecting East Cambridge's North Point Park and Charlestown's Paul Revere Park, and the entire surrounding neighborhoods including the North End, and Somerville.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At 698ft/213m, it's the longest bicycle and pedestrian bridge built in Boston, and is the first of three footbridges designed to increase access to parks and green spaces around the Charles River Basin. You can read more about the bridge planning and construction at Bridge Design &amp; Engineering Report: &quot;Twist &amp; Turn&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlesriverconservancy.org/documents/northbank.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF link&lt;/a&gt;]. For the planned map, see this [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charlesriverconservancy.org/images/NewBasinMap8InchesWide.jpg&quot;&gt;image link&lt;/a&gt;] , both links courtesy of The Charles River Conservancy. For bicyclists, here [&lt;a href=&quot;http://broadwaybicycleschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/north-point-bridge-light.jpg&quot;&gt;image link&lt;/a&gt;] is another convenient map. Also, a very nice time-lapse [&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/5xxTBEI1390&quot;&gt;YouTube video link&lt;/a&gt;] of the construction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From here you can see many famous things of Boston and of Cambridge, along the so-called &quot;Lost Half Mile&quot; of the Charles River:&lt;br /&gt;
The amphibious &quot;DUKW&quot; splashing &amp; landing&lt;br /&gt;
The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge (or Zakim Bridge)&lt;br /&gt;
The TD &quot;Gahden&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The New Charles River Dam&lt;br /&gt;
The Bunker Hill Monument&lt;br /&gt;
The Museum of Science, Boston&lt;br /&gt;
(Note: The Charles River Skatepark is also planned to open close to Stage 1 in 2013)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finding legal parking could be difficult on both sides, yet could have a higher possibilities around the North Point Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo again!!! After receiving a CO Note through my Watchlist the other day, took a short detour to revisit this cache on my way to work. It's been since 01/10/2010 when I found this as my 25th find, now returning with 368 finds. Pahked cache-cah on Highland Ave. legally under 2-hour limit, and a short walk over. No matter the freezing weather, many many muggles heading Westward towards Davis Square under the beautiful no-cloud Blue sky. As always, very tough place to be stealth, and had to wait for the right moment to grab it. Over flowing with TBs, indeed! Left three small ones in exchange for five big ones, and discovered the rest. A little more room now, though my fingers are numb. Looks like the Grove-Cedar Bikepath is going to extend beyond Cedar St. as Somerville Community Path http://pathfriends.org/scp/ Finally! Thanks again dangermouse3314 for this popular TB resting cache in this nice neighborhood. Will definitely return for more TB exchanges.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Domo!!! Yeah!!! MV25F!!! On another frigid but sunny afternoon with beautiful Blue sky. Since my lovely two-legged assistant had a 2 hour appointment near this area, I took this rare advantage to go cache-hunting and achieve my own new high of 'Four-finds in Two-hours'. This was the #4 of four planned. Since a DNF at #2 has already foiled the whole plan, hoped to end in a tie Three-a-day. Took my trusty furry four-legged assistant along as a great 'camouflage'. We've been to this bike path many times back when we use to live near the Alewife side of the this path. Very muggle-intense indeed. I guess the Pats' game didn't make much a difference after all. Relatively easy to find. Though I did NOT see any Trackables inside, I have said Good Bye to and left a 'School Bus' geocoin I have been taking around this area to visit Harvard, MIT, and Tufts, as to honor it's goal, together with my new 'Signature Item' and good luck charm &quot;Go-En-Dama&quot; Japanese 5-Yen coin. Also left five of them as Good Luck swags for following fellow cachers. Jump to my profile page to know more about &quot;Go-En&quot;. Took the little glass bug or bee, in exchange. Thanks cSaw8! Oh, I also left my Traveling Geocoin, first of mine to set out into the vast GC world, to travel to Japan and then back to me. Thank you for the hide, DM! I definitely will be back many more times to exchange Trackables here.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The location is Hansen (Henry O.) Park, in Somerville. The park is open daily until 10pm, though I've never seen it closed. It should be a somewhat easy P&amp;G. Plenty of free and metered 2hr parking right next to it.The cache type is a magnetic nano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great spot that I've driven past on my bike and car many times, but just recently stopped at. I always noticed the unusual layout, and decided it was a good day to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is dedicated to Henry O. Hansen, one of the six soldiers who raised the first U.S Flag over Mt. Suribachi on Iwo Jima, a Somerville, MA native. The small park is full of some interesting history, so I recommend taking the few mins &amp; going through it all. &lt;/p&gt;

Just like dangermouse3314's GC295D6 -Jay's Deli- cache, this one is right along my daily commute route, and I have been waiting for the best timing to hunt for it. What other day would be better than today, on Veteran's Day! Fortunately, my guess was correct, and hardly any muggles around on this chilly yet sunny late morning. Parked my cache-cah right in front of this tiny little park I knew about it's existence, though did not know about it's history &amp; meaning. Took some time to explore &amp; read the information panels. Interesting, significant &amp; complex history for me, indeed. Back to caching, even though I did have the hint, I guess I wasn't 'thorough' enough. Though have met the CO Bumble! many times, I didn't have the luxury to know his cell phone, so had to call previous finder &amp; geo-friend dangermouse3314. Thankfully, he nudged me in the correct direction, and I was able to SL soon after. A shameful 'Duh' moment... Dipped inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', following finders', and owner's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. Off to work on Veteran's Day, thanking every veteran for my peaceful smile on my face today! Thanks also to Bumble! for the nice hide in Somerville along my commute, and bringing me here to this tiny yet meaningful park. World Peace!</groundspeak:text>

(cache adopted 2012/04/21)

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A small cache that could fit a few trackables or small items. Located in Davis Square, my neighborhood. Across the street is where the farmer's market is held every summer and next door has the best candlepin and pizza around. Bring your own pen to sign this logbook. Lots of muggles be stealthy!&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A nano cache hidden on the bike path from Davis Square In Somerville to Alewife Station in Cambridge. Trolley Park located immediately off of Massachusetts Avenue is my family's favorite spot to sit down, enjoy a coffee and take in some sun. There are some cool sculptures as well as benches that rock like a porch swing. I have spent hours reading books here. Log only, bring a pencil or space pen, the log is Rite in the Rain paper.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is a film canister type. Shouldn't be too hard to spot &amp; coords should be very accurate as there isnt much tree cover. I parked over at the Sheepfold parking lot and hiked on over...but there are closer spots. If you come from Sheepfold though you might understand better why the cache is named what it is or maybe not &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Bumble! is at it again. You may have found his beacon but can you find his cache? The cache is located in the Middlesex Fells Reservation. Finding the cache will require some research &amp; legwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key to finding Bumble!'s cache is finding all the clues he
left to the cache's whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumble! set loose three bugs on the world, all of the traveling
variety. All of them happen to deal with musical Intervals within
the Harmonic Series&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------- ----- ---
Frisbee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--th Harmonic
Frisbee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dream Chord
Frisbee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of them have two numbers representing ratio of frequencies
on them. One of them has three numbers. The ratios need to be
converted to cents and rounded to the nearest whole number. If you
have collected or figured out the numbers on the bugs, after
conversion you should now have three three digit numbers. The
lowest set of numbers is &quot;A&quot;, the middle set &quot;B&quot;, and the highest
number &quot;C&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in cents rounded to the nearest whole number
between (2 / 1)^7 &amp; (3 / 2)^12 is &quot;D&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of letters in the two word name of the sequence
Bumble! is hiding next to is &quot;E&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do these numbers all mean, besides Bumble!'s obsession
with prime numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its all pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging these numbers in will lead you to the first stage of
six, the sixth being the final which is going to be found using a
projection from stage five. At each stage (except for Stage one,
The Final, and the Vertex points) there is a small green bison tube
containing the coords to the next stage or in the case of stage
five the needed info to do the projection to the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your work isn't done there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumble! is pretty protective of his cache and set up a intricate
locking mechanism to protect it. You will need the right combo to
open it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily he left clues around so you can retrieve that
information as well. He left three other cache &quot;clues&quot; in the
Fells; Natural
Enviornment?, House Of
Mirrors, and Cross Rocky
Oreos. They aren't placed at some random spots...they make up
three sides of an equal parallelogram. Using their coords you need
to plot the missing fourth vertex. Remember there are three
possible fourth vertex locations...each will have a piece of the
combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the order of the combo numbers you may be asking. The
&quot;clue&quot; cache nearest each of the vertex points will have a number
written on their respective logs. That number will indicate the
order of the combo # you found. The smallest # will go with the
smallest combo #, highest log # with highest combo # etc. After
that is figured out solve this simple puzzle to solve the order.&quot;IV
VIV&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Bumble! is an evil guy... he really is going to make
opening his cache a tough job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so there are no cheaters out there who decide to pry open
the container or use wire cutters, Bumble! has electrified the
container &amp; filled it with venomous snakes &amp; spiders. Ok
not really, but instead the combo codes will be serving a dual
purpose. They will be needed for opening the lock as well as being
used to make a projection from Stage five to the final stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this is a 4.5/4.5 for a reason. Each Stage has its own
physical or mental challenge. Though some of that rating is based
upon a cumulative affect of going through all the &quot;clue caches&quot; as
well as the multiple stages to get to the final......the terrain
can be challenging especially if wet or icy. There are very steep
areas as well as obstacles &amp; tight spaces.So don't be stupid
trying to get to my hideout...its not going anywhere &amp; you can
always try when the conditions are more ideal. Also beware of
deliberate misdirection Bumble! may have left behind. Bumble! is a
very honest liar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Stage Location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 42 D+2.C +(Ex3-4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 71 E-4.B-A+6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Nice FTF prizes waiting for those who dare come &amp; try
find me! Also made some &quot;I solved and found Bumble!'s Hideout&quot;
souvenirs. Please just take one each.... Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in one of my favorite Metro-Boston areas, The Middlesex Fells Reservation. From the Sheepfold parking it is a very easy .35-ish mile walk. You can also park a bit further away at the Long Pond and be rewarded with a very scenic 1 mile hike! Either way the area is very scenic &amp; overlooks the reservoirs.The cache itself is unusual but stands out where it was placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taking a nice walk through the fells and decided this was an ideal place to &quot;plant&quot; a cache I had been carrying around with me. Its a fantastic area, with views of both Reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title comes from the affect the reservoirs have on the trees and other things when reflected &amp; refracted off of it. Kinda reminds me of the carnival house of mirrors room, without the creepiness those usually have associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of Hidden Gems to be discovered within a short distance from GZ, so I recommend you explore the area. &lt;/p&gt;

We felt like the odd-quad since we had no leash or man's best friend. We hurried along to the trail, passing through the fence and continued on towards the cache. I don't remember the fire but you can sure see the evidence that there was one. Nice container Bumble! TFTC

state. It is a &quot;suburban cache&quot;, easy to reach from anywhere in the
greater Boston area. The location easy to get to on foot but
slightly off the beaten path. There is some treasure that will be
amusing to Boston-area residents. Also, head 100 meters South and
100 meters North for some great area views! 
&lt;p&gt;254 ft elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good hunting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note from g-o-cashers: &lt;b&gt;Please don't leave Travel Bugs in this
cache.&lt;/b&gt; The exposed location of this cache means that many
non-cachers visit the container, sign the log and in some cases
take travel bugs. I'm going to leave it this way because I think it
is important to preserve the original location, but it is not safe
to leave bugs here.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the fourth stage of a 25-hour trip across the US northeastern states to establish a record number of states geo-finds in a single day. We started in Vermont, and travelled to New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia. And we did it in a single day! 
Our team was comprised of Lulu_zulu, gr812nv, bruce iroquoia, and myself. We did this adventure on the longest day of the year, a 25-hour daylight-savings-time change day, in order to pack in as many states as we could.
We climbed this small mountain, sometimes following the trail, and a little bushwacking, and got to the top. It was a tricky hide and took quite a search. Found the cache around 4:55 a.m. Then we followed the trail down and found out why we hadn't been able to follow the trail. Some large trees and branches blocked the trail after the recent hurricane. Anyway, we got back down and on our way.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Huffed up the hill again today to check on reports that the cache was gone. Fortunately I did find it but the ammo box had been moved to a new location a few feet away.  Based on some of the written logs it seems there's a muggle who thinks its fun to move the cache around (it might have been removed for several days, but it wasn't clear from the &quot;log&quot;).  I guess muggles will always be part of First Mass!  My advice: if you don't find the cache in some of the obvious spots at ground zero take a wider look.  Reminds me of this cache: http://coord.info/GCN9EF

I found a spot that was a little less obvious but it is within a few feet of the original coordinates so no need to update. It is about 6-7' NW of the original location if you've found it previously.  Please leave it as you found it!

Packed out the &quot;authentic&quot; container and replaced it with the more durable and better camouflaged ammo box.  Barring any issues with muggles this should be good to go for 10 more years!  Thanks to everyone who attended the event and visited in the last week - it was blast!

Thanks to g-o-cachers for restoring the cache to its original glory. After yesterday's rain it was pretty wet inside so Mr K spent a lot of time drying everything out. LN, T the 10-10-10 geocoin to move along. I was really glad to finally be able to log this one, and in such good company too. TFTC!

My oldest cache to ever find, 3rd find out of the Oldest Six for The New England Challenge, and 2nd cache of today. After gathering at the parking lot below while still dark for the First Mass - 10 Years! Event Cache, signing log, getting our commemorative Geocoins, as the sky brightens up a little and No Rain (My Teru teru Bozu worked!), we hike up the trail all together. After enjoying the Boston skyline afar at sunrise waypoint, unfortunately no sun yet, we create a little traffic jam all trying to sign the logbook. What a day to sign this one! Left inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', following finders', and owner's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. And with the Event cache festivity still going strong, it was great meeting the known &amp; unknown while discovering &amp; exchanging TBs. Lots of fun! And Hey! Is that what we're all here for this early?! YES! The Rising SUN!!!

It was great to get up and cache at sunrise (we actually did see the sun) and join a fun group of diehard geocachers to celebrate Jeremy Gilbert's placement of this cache 10 years ago today.  I broke out ahead of the pack to replace the ammo canister with a more authentic 2 gallon black bucket which contains many of the original trades: play-doh, bubbles, breathmints, gold dollar and a bottle of water. 

I'll leave out this container for Loch's event http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6e0a81cd-0091-4a42-926c-b427a5df08af which will continue at sunset (weather permitting) and tomorrow morning.  Thanks to Loch for organizing the event, the coins, and the great weather for part 1. Let's hope it passes through before part 2 tonight.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It's been too long since I've visited here (almost two years) and the recent logs made it sound like I should pay ol' First Mass a visit before Earl hit later in the week.  Not sure why I picked an afternoon on one of the hottest days of the summer.  It was 95F when I left the car when I got to the top I was drenched because I was carrying a backpack with all of the cache repair essentials including a new ammo can to use as a container.

After I put down my backpack I was surprised that the cache wasn't there.  Searched for 5 minutes and nothing, I was just about ready to chalk up another container to muggles but then found it about 15' away from its original location.  The current container, a lock-n-lock which was put here by me on June 12, 2006, was down to one tab.  I guess that means lock-n-locks last about 4 years in New England.  Hopefully the new ammo box will last a bit longer.  I also replaced the logbook and moved the cache back to its original location.   The last order of business was to deal with the PI. There were some vines in the area that were as big as my thumb that I removed ahead of the 10 year event in hopes we could avoid several hundred cases of PI.

Only one more month to go. I'm hoping to have something a little more authentic ready for the actual event, but I'm afraid it would just get muggled if I put it out now.  See everyone in a month!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Since I've had reports of the container being wet inside I made the trip south at lunch to see if I could clean things up a bit.  It did have a little water in it but I couldn't see any problem with the container itself so I dried it out, cleaned out the junk, replaced some of the zip lock bags and put back the old container.  
 
I have a new container but I'll see if this one holds up before replacing it.

As usual I'm amazed at the (mostly) friendly non-geocaching traffic this cache sees.

Dropped the &quot;I seek baked beans and chowda&quot; TB through for a Boston photo op and a chance to visit New England's oldest cache but decided not to risk leaving it here.

Hard to believe that this one is coming up on it's seventh birthday -- we'll be celebrating 10 years of caching in New England before long!

I have to tell you that the night view from the trail to this cache is great. You can see downtown Boston all lit up. I think maybe the only time better to find this cache would be at sunrise on a summer morning so you could watch the sun come up. It doesn't look like the city gets it water from the pond anymore but I really enjoyed listening to the frogs and birds calling out. It was a great night with a half moon to light my path. Thanks for the cache. I really enjoyed this walk.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">With several notes indicating wet log books and cracked containers I figured it was time to make a maintenance visit to this newly adopted cache.  It has been over two years since I visited the cache so I didn't remember how to get in -- its not too often that a visit to your own cache is like discovering a new one!

Replaced the container and grabbed the old notebook to replace it with a new one -- I'm hoping to get the original notebooks from the previous owners soon.  I can't believe how many non-cachers have signed this log.  It's amazing this cache has never been destroyed or lost.

There is a fair amount of poison ivy around the cache, but it can be avoided.  Next time up I'll bring something that I can beat it back with because I really don't want to move the cache.  I'm actually hoping to replace it with a container that looks like the original.

Dropped off Spike CKay and Osteo Bones who I can't seem to get rid of!  I'm pretty sure I left him here this time!

Enjoy!

address link in the owner's profile.)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About Green Monster - Boxborough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This 2-stage multicache is located on Steele Farm conservation
land in Boxborough. A map can be found 
here. Steele Farm is the site of my 
Steele Farm Cache and these two caches can easily be done
together. I would suggest starting with this cache first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suggested parking is provided as a waypoint. Alternate more winter
friendly parking can be found on the Steele Farm Cache. If you use
the suggested parking say &quot;hi&quot; to Bones as you start your journey.
He's a very old horse, usually staked out somewhere near the
trailhead. Even though he's a least 100 years old he something of a
town fixture AND he keeps the grass low.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Proceed to the coordinates which will bring you to a large
micro-sized first stage container. Coordinates and a hint are be
provided in the first stage which will bring you a well-hidden
final where you can enjoy the view. The final is intentionally well
hidden because this area sees a fair amount of people traffic --
please rehide it as you found it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please note that even though both parts are near stone walls
that neither part is hidden in a stone wall.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take your time and enjoy the Steele Farm area. If you are coming in
the winter (usually around Superbowl Sunday) make sure you bring
your sled for the Boxborough Winter Fest which is centered around
the farm house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK11BAK - Parking Green Monster - Boxborough&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 29.342 W 071° 30.997&lt;br /&gt;Parking near the intersection of Middle and Depot Rd.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steele Farm is a 34 acre plot of land which was purchased by the
Town of Boxborough in 1994. The purchase also included three
buildings: the house, the barn and a small out building. There is a
small pond near the house. From the highest point on the property,
at the west side of the main field, you can see views of Boston
(well at least the Prudential Center and Hancock Towers) toward the
east. In January Steele Farm is the site of the annual Boxborough
Winter Fest -- the sledding is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a simple two part multi-cache that will allow you
to explore the grounds of Steele Farm. The container at the first
part is a micro -- inside this container you will find the
coordinates to the final. Both hides are near the trail so you
shouldn't need to do any serious bushwhacking. There is parking
available at N42° 29.443 W071° 31.370. Round trip from the parking
area is about 1 mile and there is a little poison ivy near both
cache locations and along the trail so beware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the area please come visit our other Boxborough
caches at 
Rolling Meadows.&lt;/p&gt;

this mystery cache you will need to start at The Other Boxborough Library.
Inside The Other Boxborough Library you will be provided with the
coordinates to this cache. However, the coordinates are not
provided on a traditional printed sheet - you will need a
compatible Garmin GPS device (see details below) to download the
coordinates and hint from the Garmin chirp beacon located
inside the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final is located at one of my favorite spots in Patch
Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache requires special equipment&lt;/b&gt;. In order to find
this cache you must have a Garmin Oregon (except 200), Dakota 20,
GPSMAP 62 or GPSMAP 78 running the latest software which supports
Garmin chirp. See this page for
details on how to use chirp and update your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Hermit Crabs for the cache container. This is the old

Random Multi final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Nordymogul on the FTF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

The chirp allured me to come back to an area I had not visited since April 2006. While studying in the library, I heard the &quot;now familiar&quot; tone of the chirped Oregon 550t, and headed out in search of the final. I followed the trails and had no trouble finding the well concealed cache. Although I felt the temptation to bushwhack in spots, taking the trail proved to be a much more expedient trek. Dropped Titlak's Moon Dipper Geocoin and took nothing. Thanks Go$rs for bringing me back here.

The origional mill was destroyed in King Phillip's war, and was immediately rebuilt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mill eventually passed to Herbert Clark, who sold it to the town of Bedford in 1947. The town demolished the mill and the dam in an attempt to improve storm drainage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a small container with a log book and room for fairly small items. The internal size is about 3.5&quot; wide by about 6&quot; long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I placed it near my work because I was very excited to find other caches local in that area too. It isn't much of a hike, but I didn't think that was so bad because it makes for good &quot;lunch-time&quot; caching adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is probably accessable in as much as a foot of snow. It also has a &quot;sort of&quot; camo cover.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Couldn't park on the side of the road because of snow, so ended up parking at the homes across the street and walking through the snow.... Took a bit of searching to locate the correct area. Took a lot more effort to free the cache from it's frozen home and then couldn't manage to get the darn thing out of its hiding spot. At that point my hands were a bit frozen. I have photos if proof is needed, but I wasn't able to sign the log. TFTC!

&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;This is the Rolling Meadows conservation area. It consists of
open areas, wooded areas, and a quiet little brook. There are lots
of trails and the cache is not far off of one of them. It is an
easy, relatively short walk from the roadside parking. Stay a while
and enjoy the solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Adopted and reopened on 11/23/03 by g-o-cashers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love caches that involve meadows and fields boardered by
woods. Throw in an old farm and I'm in heaven. If you've been to my
other cache in Boxborough called Steele
Farm you'll know what I mean. About 2 months ago I found out
that this cache was here in Rolling Meadows, a site which I had
considered for my own cache. I was allowed to adopt this cache from
the previous owner Joel Mozer who has since moved away. Please
thank Joel
(he still caches in Southern New Mexico) for the original cache.
This cache was the 50th cache placed in Massachusetts and is
currently about the 35th oldest active cache in the state. As best
I could, I've tried to preserve everything about the original
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache may not be winter accessible if there is a lot of
snow or ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Town of Boxborough purchased this 35-acre plot in 1990. The
land was originally part of the Jacob Littlefield farm (c. 1846)
which you can see at the northern part of the property -- this is
still a private residence so please don't walk through their front
yard. A small brook runs along the northwestern property line. The
front portion of the parcel is a hay field which extends down into
a wet meadow and into forested woodland. If you make a dawn or dusk
trip here you'll have a great chance of seeing wildlife in the
boundary areas where the fields and woods meet including deer, red
fox and coyote. Families with young children will appreciate the
short, dry and relatively flat hike. There is parking for one or
two cars at N42° 30.029 W071° 29.036&lt;/p&gt;

Patch Hill conservation land and it serves several purposes.
It:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marks the Liberty Square Road trailhead to Patch Hill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;holds a copy of &lt;i&gt;Boxborough: Portrait of a Town&lt;/i&gt; (see
check out guidelines below). This book will help you complete

SCWB's Boxborough Centric series series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the starting point for Patch Hill Chirps!. Details on how
to find Patch Hill Chirps! can be found on that cache page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to find the cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of SCWB's cache (and the many fine mystery caches
in the area) you will need to solve an easy puzzle using a little
Boxborough history. You need to know what year Boxborough was
incorporated, call that year ABCD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at: &lt;b&gt;N42 30.A(D+1)0 W71
30.(C/2)(B-1)4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checking out &lt;i&gt;Boxborough: Portrait of a Town&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCWB recently published an excellent 
series of educational caches highlighting the history of
Boxborough. We were fortunate enough to be FTF on 
BC #10 and as a FTF prize we took away a copy of &lt;i&gt;Boxborough:
Portrait of a Town&lt;/i&gt;. It is a difficult book to find but helpful
if you want to complete this series. We would like to share our
copy with the rest of the geocaching community especially if you
can't get to the real Boxborough Library where
there is another copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take out this copy of &lt;i&gt;Boxborough: Portrait of a Town&lt;/i&gt;
contact us through our 
profile and let us know when you would like to pick up the
book. We'll do our best to drop it off in the cache on the morning
of that day. You can take it for 24 hours (or longer if you arrange
it with us ahead of time). When you are done drop the book back in
the cache and send us an email so we can retrieve the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Checking out the book is NOT a requirement to log the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

We upgraded the firmware on my Oregon yesterday and this afternoon Mr Kestrel, OleSeeker and I made a trip to Boxborough (fast becoming the caching capital of Metro West).  I wasn't exactly sure how to turn on chirp reception on my unit but a bit of toggling around revealed it in a logical place.  It worked like a charm!  Very cool.  After we signed the log for this cache, we set off in search of the Patch Hill Chirps cache.  This was a lot of fun, and I hope that despite the expense of the chirp devices, it will catch on.  I bet the local cache hiders could do some very creative things with them.  Thanks for the cache and the introduction to a new gadget!

PS - how did I forget to mention the discovery of my long-lost caching hat at the trailhead?  I had been looking for it for weeks, and there it was, hanging on a tree.  Big thanks to whoever picked it up and put it there.  That hat has been with me on many adventures, and I was really glad to get it back.

took crawfish, left a bunch of farm animals.

paasing hikers found it and signed in too :-) . 

tucked it back under rocks, it was just laying on top. :-)  now its back ay the base of the cool looking rock. 

took a whole to figure out that we had to go to the quarry.  Follow the gps through the woods, then later found the path... 
Who is a good find.

My log in the logbook read: &quot;Some cache make a difference, and some cachers make a difference too!! Thanks Scott for being an inspiration for many of us.

His willingness to help others and enthusiasm for the sport are &quot;contagious&quot;. Picked up a rubber chicken and dropped Winifred TB, an elephant. Always remember- An elephant never forgets as does a geocacher when an act of kindness is offered.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This 31-acre plot was purchased by the Chelmsford Conservation
Commission in 1968 from the daughter of George Benjamin Barrett
Wright. Since then additional land donations have brought the total
size to 110 acres of woodlands and watershed for Putnam Brook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A nurseryman, George B. B. Wright planted many unusual species of
trees and flowering plants on the site. Among them are magnolias,
wisteria, and other species from different parts of the country and
the world. You can see what remains of his work during this walk,
particularly near Stage 2 of this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today the Chelmsford Open Space Stewardship assists with the
maintenance and care of the property. The land stewards Scott and
Amy have made numerous improvements to the trails and bridges in
recent months. In addition, they have blazed a new trail to the
west part of the property which in the winter serves as a snowshoe
trail. If you enjoy the area please send them a word of
encouragement for all the hard work they've done. They can be
contacted through the COSS web
page. You can find a map of the reservation 
here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This family friendly 3-stage multi-cache will explore the new trail
and some of the sights along it. Keep your eyes open in the
northwest part of the area for the old horse-drawn
McCormick-Deering manure spreader as well as barn foundations
which were part of the old nursery. How about that old pine trunk
or the &quot;Bittersweet Jungle&quot;? As you enjoy the area please stick to
the trails. There are several very wet muddy areas near Putnam
Brook that should avoided. No bushwhacking is required as all parts
of the cache are less than 50' from the trail including the
final.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are visiting this cache please also stop by the other two
caches in the Reservation: 
Gas Saver IV and 
Putnam Brook Cache.&lt;br /&gt;

Love the old tractor in the tree!  Lots to look at here.  This was a well-done multi, you can tell g-o-cachers put a lot of effort into this quality hunt, I appreciated it!</groundspeak:text>

Some cool things around the second phase cache, old farm foundation and some old farming equipment. Watch out for the pricker bushes near the horse drawn manure spreader. They are real thick in that area. Nice walk around this quiet wooded area. A bunch of cool things in the final cache. We left a wrapped cough drop in case someone has a sore throat. We hit the other two caches in this area also. A nice quiet walk. Thanks!

I had begun just around 7:15 PM and quickly found the well-hidden micros, but was stalled for more than 30 minutes looking for the final in the wrong spot. Reading GeoJ's log- &quot;spot-on coords&quot;, I wondered what was I missing ? I scoured great spots and walked through PI, and as the skies got dark, I had resigned myself to go back to Stage 2 to get the hint. Along came three cachers with headlamps; they wondered what I was doing over there? Does he have a GPS ? I asked: &quot;Are you geocaching?&quot; The answer &quot;Yes&quot;. Did you find the final? &quot;We are headed there now- about 200 feet away. Then I realized I input the wrong digit. Off we went and the rest was easy. Dropped the Alaska Geocoin, Constabulary Geocoin and Bigrock95 Walking Stick (prior 3-virtually) and the Speedsters European Union 1 Geocoin, took MstZilla's Dragonfly Geocoin. Thanks to Go$rs and my serendipitous companions.

Our explorer looks beyond the dried up lake, now filled with lush green grass that displays glistening patterns as the wind gently moves it about.
They see what looks to be the remains of an ancient castle, a gateway if you will, a glimpse into the past.
Intrigued, our explorer begins to walk towards this forgotten tunnel, knowing not what they will find within this strange, uninhabited ancient place.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
---The local's description:
Down by the old swimming hole, you'll see this wall right?, it's like an old stone wall kinda hidden by some brush, but it goes on like a hallway down to the river.
Watch out for trash and some mosquitoes.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
---The historical description:
In the early days of Fitchburg Ma, the Rotary club and other organizations built parks, this wall, circa 1920s was built as a flood gate to allow water to be directed into the park, creating a swimming area.
In the late 1980s, it was decommissioned and is no longer used.
All but forgotten this &quot;hallway&quot; of stone stands alone and grown in, but is very nice to see, and in the summer, the late -afternoon sunshine makes this place look almost mysterious and almost magical.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

As a kid I used to pretend I was in the movie Labyrinth here. It's a cool little park n snag sorta cache, but you will have to look for it a bit.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a small Tupperware container full of gumball machine stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first one so please sign the log book!     

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Please let me know if the cache is damaged, stolen, leaking, or anything like that and I will fix it asap, I am in that area every week or so.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with good Easter egg hunting skills can find this one.  </groundspeak:long_description>

EDIT: 11/09/2012 I moved the cache back to its original spot behind the pillar in the middle of the tunnel.
It was behind the first pillar, I thought someone stole it.
I buried it in leaves a bit to hide it better. It is still in the middle of the bush elevated from water. So no worries.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While we don't have much for high elevation in eastern
Massachusetts we do have some interesting local high points. The
goal of this cache is to have you visit the high point of
Chelmsford. On a clear day in the winter months you will get some
partial views to the south and east. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Homework&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, you'll need to do a little research to determine where the
highest point of elevation in Chelmsford is located. Print out a
copy of the picture below to bring with you. Also, see Double Bonus
below -- you'll be missing out if you don't arrange a visit to the
tower.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Field Work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Locate Chelmsford's high point and find the exact object in the
picture below, which may or may not be at the exact highest
spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This object is within 75' of the high point so some searching may
be required. Once you've located this object you can project a
waypoint to the cache. Using your GPS (or other tools) project the
following waypoint: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Distance: 143 m &lt;br /&gt;
Bearing: 92 deg True &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This will provide you with the coordinates for the final cache
container. The cache is a little larger than a micro, but shouldn't
be hard to find. Bring something to write with. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Bonus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a little more work you should be able to log another find (or
two) on the same trip. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Double Bonus (added 4/27/07)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a recent maintenance visit to the cache I discovered
something very exciting about this area. Near the first part of the
cache there is a 70' tall fire tower (another clue!). If there is a
fire danger of 3 or more the tower is manned. On fire danger 3 days
(not 4 and 5) the fire warden can invite you up -- in fact they are
very happy to have company on slow days. You can call the tower
before you leave to check the status at (978)256-2651. Just ask if
visits to in tower are permitted on that day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would &lt;b&gt;highly&lt;/b&gt; recommend making a trip on a day you can
visit the tower, it is probably the single most impressive view
I've ever had of northeastern Massachusetts. Visibility includes
Mt. Wachusett and Mt. Monadnock as well as Tipling Rock (Sudbury)
and Nashoba Hill with 360 degree views of the surrounding towns.
See the photos from 
my 4/26/07 log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

Having done seriously :grin: my prep. back home before leaving [;)], I was here to finish up this fine puzzle cache.
After a bit of searching, we spotted the nice container in its winter friendly position.
Excellent cache that I recommend.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This was an old cattle tunnel under the street next to the school.&lt;br/&gt;Just past the score board you will notice a small path leading behind the field and down the hill, to your immediate left there will be a tunnel, it is in the ceiling of this tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;It's a great cache for winter, but today when I hid this cache in this secret tunnel I usedto play in as a child, it was full of large black spiders.&lt;br/&gt;So if you are afraid of spiders, and the occasional barn swallow, then avoid this one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinates may be within 50 ft.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is tucked away in the ceiling of the tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;This should be a sort of park and grab, with a dash of adventure and history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am practically giving this one away with the hints simply because if it is summer, you will want to get in and out of there quick, the bugs can be bad, but it is a kid friendly cache and nothing too difficult or hardcore. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and please let me know if the cache is still there and if it is intact.&lt;br/&gt;In the winter it is going to be easier to get around in there as far as bugs and birds go, so as soon as fall starts moving in, I will tuck the cache up into the ceiling better, and it will be a little harder to spot.&lt;br/&gt;But for now, enjoy! ^_^  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S. You may need a flashlight.</groundspeak:long_description>

I almost couldn't close it so I took a couple items I left originally out and it closes, but its hard, you might want to check it out next time you are in the area :)</groundspeak:text>

The app on my phone does not show the photos I came in from the hospital side, took main path to scott road, then some off path just after lightning trail, wound my way up to flat rock road, then finally I saw a link. A great day for it it's nice out all I can smell is pine needles up here, it's absolutely gorgeous. But if I wasn't covered head to toe and 100 percent Deet... I would be a skel-ol-eton. :-) also be careful of water and deep mud :-) 
I put the cache back where i found it, only this time on two logs to get it off the ground a bit ^_^

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hi, 
&lt;p&gt;My name is Aldo. I am a two year-old German Shepherd living in
Andover, Massachusetts. On December 10, 2000 I stashed a geocache
at the location above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's on the Trustees of Reservations's Charles Ward Reservation
in Andover, Massachusetts. The parking lot for the reservation is
at the end of Prospect Road east of Rt 125 in Andover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding my cache it would be a pleasant trip on which one could
include one's kids. It's off one of the hiking trails, I'd rate the
difficulty and terrain both a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a Tupperware container, there's a picture here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cache is a log book and five CD-ROMs containing a movie
that I made about my geocache. (Windows Media Player format) Feel
free to take a CD-ROM and leave something in it's place. There's
also camera. Take your picture, I'll return in a bit and have the
pictures developed and will post them here. You can send me an
email at castaldi@mediaone.net -Aldo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update 10/22/2007 by g-o-cashers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the original rubbermaid container which was
used for almost 7 years was replaced with a large ammo box!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of 2007 the area surrounding the cache was hit by a
micro-burst which knocked down many large pines. While this event
didn't damage the cache it has made the search more difficult.
Stick to the west side of the heaviest damage and you'll find the
cache there.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Oldest in Massachusetts http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=a299ab62-a135-4fea-a037-9fa531ba4451 After finding some of the other original placements, I have noticed the exceptional quality of locations (all before the LPC's and guardrail micros).

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally got over here to do a little maintenance on this cache and find several other new caches on Holt Hill.   As for this cache I replaced the cracked container with a large ammo box, replaced the full logbook, added some pens/pencils, cleaned up the swag and bagged everything that needed to be bagged.  This cache should be good to go for another 7 years!  I also took the camera and will develop the pictures -- that'll be interesting!

One note -- the area near the cache went through an unbelievable transformation this spring during a bad storm.  I would say that a micro-burst hit the area because there are several very large sheered off pine trees that looked healthy.  The cache was not damaged but it has made the searching a little more difficult.  I'm going to post some updated coordinates and let people know you don't need to go into the worst of the blowdowns.   Stay to the west side of the worst part of it and you'll find the cache!

According to the MA cache history page http://webpages.charter.net/clandelaney/First100MA/MA.htm this was the 7th cache ever placed in Massachusetts and the 4th oldest active cache in the state.  I was able to visit this cache a few months ago for the first time and was convinced it was worth saving.

I'll try to make a trip over in the next week or two to replace the cache container/log book/etc.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After all the research on old Massachusetts caches I decided it was finally time to visit this cache.   If you haven't followed some of the recent threads on the NE forums this cache was the eighth placed in Massachusetts and the fifth oldest active cache in the state as of this log.  

As with most old caches the hide tries to bring you someplace unique and interesting.  Unfortunately I was very pressed for time because there was thunder booming all around and a migraine headache struck me just as I was getting to the cache.  So unfortunately it was a quick log, a chance to admire a piece of MA caching history and then a jog back to the car before the skies opened up.  

As others have noted the container is damaged.  I brought a small container hoping I could replace the one there or do the container-within-a-container trick but neither really worked.  The duct tape is doing its job for now but I'll see about adopting this one if the owner isn't available to maintain any longer.

I was also bummed that the original log wasn't there although the one in the cache has been there since late 2001, it should make for a good read once I have a little more time.

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I stumbled on an active &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GCAA96&quot;&gt;
cache&lt;/a&gt; in these woods... and I've been a geocacher ever since.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years, it happened again! This time, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GCAC97&quot;&gt;
cache&lt;/a&gt; I found had been archived over 5 years ago...what a fun
unexpected find! Unfortunately, I was unable to adopt the original
cache, but I liked the hide area and decided to reuse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache contains a logbook, small trinkets and an unactivated
travel bug for the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Legend of the Hatchet Man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the early 1840's, a mysterious hermit built his home
on land once occupied by a local Native American tribe in a part of
the woods known as Augumtocooke. Settlers in the area were unnerved
by the stranger as he would not speak to them at all - instead
staring at them silently with cold, black eyes as he drank from
old, large whiskey jug. They quickly learned to leave the newcomer
alone and warned their children to stay away from the home of this
moody, bearded stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One summer Mr. Willowdale, a local farmer and his wife went
missing. Neighbors searched the entire forest, but despite finding
a large pool of blood and a torn dress, no other trace of the
farmer or his wife was ever found. For some reason, it was assumed
at the time that Mr. Willowdale had killed his wife and fled, as
they were known to argue quite often, but no one really knew for
sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later during the autumn harvest, 11 year old
Timothy Carver and his friend, 10 year old Joshua Althea went
missing. Again, nearby neighbors searched the woods thoroughly. And
once again, they were unable to find any trace of the boys, though
this time they noticed the waters of a nearby swamp had turned a
scarlet red hue. Sensing something evil was going on, people became
frightened and refused to travel through the woods. Some began to
wonder about the mysterious hermit, who by this time had not been
seen in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a drunken dare during a full moon which led a couple of
teenagers, George and John Carney, to sneak up to the hermit's home
one night...since the old hermit had not been seen in awhile, it
was assumed he had moved on and abandoned his home, or perhaps fell
victim to the same evil force which had apparently taken the lives
of four local residents. Entering through a window, George lit a
lantern and within seconds began screaming &quot;Hatchet Man! Hatchet
Man! Hatchet Man!&quot;. Terrified, John took off back to his familys'
homestead - looking back to to find, to his horror, a dark figure
clutching a large hatchet was running after him! As he got closer
to home, John began screaming for help and his parents and their
neighbors rushed to his aid. The dark figure with the hatchet was
no longer behind him. After John told them what had happened, they
grabbed torches and pitchforks and made their way back to the
hermit's home. It was there that they found the body of George -
lying on the ground, a large hatchet protruding from his lifeless
body. Angered, the Carney family and their neighbors threw their
lanterns through the windows of the home, igniting a large fire.
The home became engulfed in flames. Within minutes, a horrible
unearthly howl was heard and a man hurled himself out of the house
through the burning door. It was the hermit, clutching a large
hatchet as he staggered menacingly toward the assembled group.
Without hesitation, they ran him through with their pitchforks, and
dragged his body to the edge of Scarlet Swamp where they hung his
body from a large tree. It appeared the mysterious hermit, the
Hatchet Man, was dead. Weeks later, a stone monolith was erected by
the Carney family on the edge of Scarlet Brook as a memorial to
those who lost their lives that year...some visitors to the
monolith beleive they can still hear the anguished voices of those
victims, their souls unable to find peace after meeting their
gruesome fate in the cold, dark woods of Augumtocooke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, it is considered very dangerous to walk through
this section of woods after sunset. Through the years, many people
have claimed to have heard the ghastly howl of the Hatchet Man.
Others have claimed that they've seen a shadowy figure staring at
them in the woods, holding a large old whiskey jug. Still others
believe they can hear the creaking of the old rope used to hang
Hatchet Man's body from the old tree at the edge of Scarlet Swamp.
It is said the Hatchet Man may be summoned back home by calling out
his name three times. But who would be so foolish as to tempt fate
in such a way? Only time will tell if the Hatchet Man's evil,
murderous rampage is truly over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache is located in the Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State
Forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rising like a tombstone on the edge of Scarlet Brook, the
mysterious Forest Monolith stands alone in a quiet section of the
woods...who put it here, and why? The forest holds many
secrets...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a concealed ammo box, Some minor bushwhacking
may be involved to gain access to the cache site, as it is off the
beaten path. Bring a camera and take some shots of this quiet,
peaceful section of woods. This is a family friendly cache.&lt;/p&gt;

The clocks were an afterthought, the towers wer built to house the fire hoses.  Apparently the cloth hoses would be eaten by rats or get moldy if not kept hung up properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache should be a quick one and while there are always muggles about it shouldn't be too bad for an experienced cacher like you to handle.

I'd better keep looking.&quot;Did this one in the rain too, a good time to do it, no one around.Took a guy from work because he lives near by and never cached before.There was no pen for the log, so I cut down a bic like Mc Giver and then clipped the tube down too, folded tape over the end and wraped it up inside in tape, stuck a wad of paper in the end and hopefully it wont leak, but now the cache has a pen!I was totally gonna leave something but the cache is so tiny there is really no room for anything, very fun little place it's hidden though.Look good, it's totally there.This one got someone new excited about caching, so good job!Very accessible cache and easy to find if you got your easter egg skills on ^_^Also, the place its near, is AMAZING for food very authentic and very very good.</groundspeak:text>

It was logged yesterday on gc.com so it is still there.   It was originally secured with velcro but I have had reports that the velcro was not sticking or was not used and it was farther in the hidey-hole than intended and harder to spot.

Visitors can park in the Welcome Center parking lot right off Exit 6 which makes for an easy park'n'grab cache for tourists passing through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Log (required)&lt;br/&gt; - 2G micro SD chip&lt;br/&gt; -  2G SD chip&lt;br/&gt; - 1G CF chip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a spare XD, Smart Media or USB stick feel free to donate it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Was easy, and fun.
Left some silica packs to keep the chips dry.
Took some photos with my camera (CF Card) and my friend took some with his on the same card, after we had to format the card because it read error in both cameras, and the SD card would not pull anything up on picture viewer in the Garman unit, my laptop is toast so I can't check them with the reader.
Left a silver coin, and some stuff, wish I had more to offer the cache, maybe next time I am in the area I will leave a card or two.

Looking forward to maybe seeing other pictures people leave. ^_^

(Note: Shown found count 390 above is actually 394, due to 4 'non-logged' MA finds to be backlogged later on. Complicated...)

On this almost no-cloud beautiful Blue-sky &amp; not-so-chilly morning, making a return visit to Nashua and it's Mine Falls Park since my first time here finding &quot;NH #1 - Mines Follies&quot; http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=e74c148a-4ff7-469b-87c1-5b5304887b29 as my 257th find &amp; 200th Trad on 09/18/2010. Plan to attend the &quot;NashuaCLEAN CITO event&quot; cache later on at noon, and was in need to rake-up a few more finds in order to align the event as my #400 Milestone. Dropped my lovely two-legged assistant at the nearby L.L.Bean Outlet, and made a short drive to the E-Zpass Walk-In Center. Reading the descriptions on my assistant's iPod Touch, I noticed I did not have anything to read the listed microchip. Darn. Then again, if so, I though this should be listed as a &quot;?&quot; cache and not a Trad. Hmm... Maybe my camera works??? Anyways, made a short walk with my furry four-legged assistant to GZ. None of the 4&quot; of snow that fell on April Fool's Day was to be found. Got a splinter in my hand from the thorns, and also almost slipped into the nearby Nashua River. Phew. Looked up, and there it was! Not a single flash memory chip inside, unfortunately (or fortunately?). SL &amp; left inside my signature Good Luck &quot;Go-En&quot; 「五円」 Japanese 5-Yen coin for all cachers', following finders', and CO's good luck. Please visit my profile page for additional information about &quot;Go-En&quot; 「ご縁」. Posting a picture, as I always do, as well. My furry assistant was whining &amp; could not keep her eyes off the bright-Yellow Tennis ball inside, but I did not let her touch it, as we have plenty of those at home. Thanks newts for the hide, and bringing me to this location. 6 more to #400!</groundspeak:text>

Replaced the cache today with new chips and new trinkets including a Slinky!  I also nudged the terrain up a bit as it is a little woodier than it was when I first made this cache.

So if the creek don't rise, maybe this one will stay around for a while.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This should be an easy find.  However...  I did notice last week that the river had flooded nearly to the top as well as the ditch on the other side making a peninsula of the area.  It may have floated away.  I am traveling for the next weeks but if it isn't found when I return I will have to recreate it.  Again.

Remember: the camera chips are for using in your phone or camera to take a pic and then returning to the cache.

Trade items include:

 - Fail Whale
 - Fish toy
 - Foreign coins.

The cache seems in good shape with about 50% log or better.  One note of caution is there is a creature hole nearby. I don't know what kind of creature it is.  You can stick your hand down there and examine the bite marks if you wish to find out.  Check out http://newts.org/MicroChipMicroCache.</groundspeak:text>

The pencil I had didn't fit so it would be good if someone could leave a shorty.  Great idea for a cache, it'll be interesting to see how well different devices can share the same media cards -- I know they don't all use the same format.  I snapped a picture of myself on the CF card -- it seemed to be the first one.

I checked on it Saturday and it was fine.  I suppose it could have gone missing overnight but unlikely.  Contact me for a hint if you want to try again.  I will check again it in the the next few days.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first in the Tarot Quest Series. If it continues is up
to those who Seek!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ninja’s Mom and Momma
Queen were having some mom time in the Queen’s Secret Hideaway. The
Two Ninjas were watching over the three little Queens, whilst The
King, Jajast and Mrs. Britpitt were out caching. Momma Queen had
just poured the tea when there was a flash of light in the secret
hideaway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before them stood a statuesque woman, dressed in mystical garb. She
moved like a cat, and when she spoke, they felt compelled to listen
rather than question her presence in the secret hideaway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You have done well on your individual tasks and created some very
interesting and challenging caches for the geocachers on their
quests. Now, however, it is time for you to work together.” She
waved her hands, and there was a flash of light, and a deck of
cards appeared. She passed the cards to the Ninja’s Mom and Momma
Queen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You must take this tarot deck, and first and foremost, hide it
from unscrupulous eyes. It must remain safely hidden away so that
those who seek will find them unmolested. Each soul should pick the
card that speaks to them, discover its magical story and place it
in a hidden place for other to find.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a flash of light and the mysterious woman vanished from
sight. The Ninja’s Mom and Momma Queen sat over their now cool tea
and discussed their mystical visitor and her challenge, and after a
short time, they devised guidelines for those who would come to
seek. The decided the safest place to hide this treasure was in the
King’s Enchanted Forest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. This cache is open and available for anybody to find.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Please do NOT take a card unless you are
going to use it to hide another cache. &lt;br /&gt;
3. If you want to hide a cache in this series, reach into the bag
and take a card. Don’t peek, just grab 1 card. The card you grab is
the card you get!&lt;br /&gt;
4. Find the meaning of the card, and hide a cache with that card as
the name of the cache. Please include the meaning of the card in
your cache description. If you can't find the card meaning, drop me
a line and I'll get it for you. Call your cache Tarot Quest, and
the name of the card you drew from the deck. Remeber to put your
card in the cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The deck in this cache is the Rider Waite deck. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to Tarot
historian Tom Tadfor Little, traditional playing cards were first
seen in Europe in 1375, having been brought over from the Islamic
societies where they had been used for centuries before that. These
cards were not, however, Tarot cards. At this point, he says, there
is no evidence to show that Tarot cards had yet been created, which
goes against many claims that ordinary playing cards evolved from
the original Tarot deck. &lt;br /&gt;
It wasn't until 1440 that the cards that were most likely the
origin of Tarot cards were first mentioned. In a letter from the
Duke of Milan, there was a request for several decks of &quot;triumph&quot;
cards to be used at a special event. The letter differentiated
triumph cards from regular &quot;playing&quot; cards. &lt;br /&gt;
It does appear, however, that the first Tarot decks were created as
a game. There were four suits with cards numbered one through ten
and also court cards that included a queen, king, knight and page.
The deck also included 22 symbolic picture cards that did not
belong to any suit. The decks were used to play a game called
triumph that was similar to bridge. In triumph, 21 of the 22
special picture cards were permanent trump cards. The game spread
quickly to all parts of Europe. People began referring to as
tarocchi, which is an Italian version of the French word tarot,
around 1530. &lt;br /&gt;
In 1781, in France and England, followers of the occult discovered
Tarot cards. They saw the symbolic pictures of the cards as having
more meaning than the simple trump cards they were used for at the
time. They used the cards as a divination tool, and occult writers
wrote about &quot;the Tarot.&quot; After this, the Tarot became a part of
occult philosophy. &lt;br /&gt;
There are also those who believe that Tarot cards originated in
Egypt. In some circles, they are thought to be the sole surviving
&quot;book&quot; from the great fire that burned the libraries of ancient
Egypt. In this theory, the cards are considered to be the
hieroglyphical keys to life.

Black Belt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shodan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Congratulations...now you're a BLACK BELT - well
almost.  You started out as a White belt, and from there moved
on to Yellow and Orange belts. After that came Purple belt and you
were allowed to wear a black ghi! After that, you became a Blue
belt and then Blue with a stripe. You could see the end of your
journey. Then you were a Green belt followed by a Green with a
stripe. After that came Brown. And now..... BLACK BELT! The
requirements for black belt are particularly strenuous.  You
need to be familiar with the five school animals, and what they
represent.  The  school animals are the dragon, the
snake, the crane, the tiger, and the leopard.  You must also
be aware of the school rules.  They are character, effort,
etiquette, self-control and sincerity.  And above all, you
must be familiar with ALL your material.  When preparing to
test for black belt, students will review all their material, from
white belt to brown belt.  Students are required to know all
their forms, blocks, punches, grabs and defenses against knives and
clubs. They will know all their kenpos and all of their
combinations.  Combinations are numbered.  Kenpos are
identified by letters.  Students testing for black will show
tremendous strength and fortitude as they condition their bodies
for a test that lasts for hours.  Countless hours are spent
reviewing material and honing their bodies to withstand the rigors
of the black belt test.  Are you up for the
challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

I was being so clever, as I thought I knew the key to the puzzle. Although I could not get a success. I worked and worked and worked on it. Finally in frustration I emailed Mom and got a push. Doh, I feel like a moron. Great series, I had fun with these. TFTC SL.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The two ninjas thought that a karate theme would be good for our

progress, you test for belts of different colors. So we decided to
start out with an easy &quot;WHITE BELT&quot; cache.

It's a beautiful area, so bring a camera. A couple of people said
the coordinates were off a bit so we went up and checked again. We
came up with: N42°54.421 W071°24.339 But britpitts said the
original coordinates were fine. Congrats Reborn 627 - FTF</groundspeak:long_description>

When you drop a GeoKrety into an Opencaching.com cache just make a note of it in a comment log on the cache page.  That way others will know if there's a geokrety there or not.  Use the reference number not the tracking number in your log.

This cache has been relocated from it's earlier location due to clear cutting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use craft and cunning to tactfully maneuver your way secretly to Fort Massabesic, located in the woods on the outskirts of the lake. You must not allow yourself to be followed!!  You are to find the hidden camo container.  Because this is home base and headquarters for AA17TB limited information about the container is available.  We're sure everyone understands.  There you will find a top secret payload.  Inside are a couple of small items.  Once there, make sure you sign in and feel free to take an item of your choice.  Leave an item behind-please try to keep to the military theme although other items are ok.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adopted by wd1j 7/28/2011 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to RENE for FTF!!!!&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On the town square is what looks like a stone statue of a soldier, although actually it is cast of zinc alloy metal which weathers to that color. A closer look at the statue shows that it has the brimmed hat and blanket roll typical of the Confederate Army rather than the billed cap and haversack of the Union Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is doubtful that Pembroke had any substantial number of Confederate veterans or would choose to recognize them explicitly. According to a researcher I met, the Bridgeport CT foundry [Monumental Bronze Co] that cast statues of various styles may have offered a deal on this type and 4 penny-pinching towns in NH and perhaps others in the North bought them in lieu of the Union style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To claim this cache, enter as 2 digits the number of wars memorialized by the plaque on the front of the statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

Using only the Nuvi 40 GPS from the car (wonder if that's the usual).

It was very wet, my Daughter wouldn't put her hand in the container.
So big brave Dad had to!  Signed the Log Book as MJC.
Someone was there the day before.  It was really cool!

Took a little Panda Bear - Left a Glass Shamrock Heart.

Will do some more and even thinking about hiding one!

P.S. A better description would be awesome for this, maybe some pirate directions from the path (I.E. 20 paces from the path) kind of things.
If I didn't have my friend with me I don't think I would have found it, we had 3 GPSs with us and only the Garmin from the car worked (Nuvi) Phone signal is hard to come by in that area so phone GPSs are sorta spotty, the one from the car was REALLY accurate got us within a couple feet of it.
Again, nice work and thanks for the fun!

The 1772 Meetinghouse is situated on Old Bay Road and by its very name provides the clue as to its original use by past residents for the Town of New Durham. This was the building that began the process of local town governance in a fledgling democratic manner. The historical decisions made determined the origins and growth of the Town of New Durham. Great place for a short walk and hike.  Rock walls remind us of the farmland it used to be. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Stopped by after hunting a couple GC.com caches.  I've been here before looking for the cache that's 127 feet away.

The fact that another cache already exists well within 500 feet, and the fact that caches hidden in historic structures like this often lead to destruction, lead to my low rating of this cache.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

There are nice paths that are easily hiked. This first cache is just a short walk on the path. Not a  strenuous walk but there are a lot of roots to step over. This is the first of two similar caches placed in this park.  It is in my Dime a Dozen series. Container is attached to something you might find in such a park and it has a dozen dimes in it.  You can either take a dime,leave a dime or just sign the log. Please take your own pen.  It is not necessary to bushwhack or step more than just a few steps off the main path.  If you are in the correct area these are fairly simple to find. The cache is off the ground and if you can get in the trails in winter, the cache should be accessible. You can only look for this cache during daylight hours because the park rules don't allow anyone in after dusk.  This is a conservation area so please tread gently, stay on paths and don't disrupt any fauna. Enjoy your hike! Dogs must be on a leash.&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Spirit Howler and Barefootgal for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Don't mistake the BIG trees (very close to main path) for buffalo. Watch out for bats even during daylight hours.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

If you found the first one you should find this one easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second cache in Buffalo Park and if you found the first one this should be easy (unless you are short).  For those (like me) who are vertically challenged it will be quite a stretch.  Cache is a small container attached to something that would likely live in this park. It is part of my Dime a Dozen series. You can either take a dime, leave a dime or just sign the log. Please take your own pen.  It is not necessary to bushwhack or step more than just a few steps off the main path.  If you are in the correct area these are fairly simple to find.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Into the woods from the RR tracks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park at an appropriate spot on Silver Lake Rd near the RR tracks.  Proceed S on tracks for about a 5 minute walk to a spot where you must enter the woods. (Tracks are active but are generally only used by the RR a few times a year so do use caution if you hear a train but should be safe most of the time.  The RR bed is an active snowmobiling trail so if you try winter caching do use caution.) Not close but not far into the woods.  Should be winter accessible if you can hike through the snow.  Small lock and lock box with many kid friendly items. Please leave the cache exactly as you found it. President Andrew Johnson will be waiting for FTF. Congratulations Otter-Pop for FTF!  You got there before I even knew it was published!&lt;br/&gt;*** If you go down the RR tracks and look for a yard with many play things before you enter the woods (look at picture) you should find a path and not have to encounter a wire fence.  You should go beyond the cache area when you enter and then head back a little once in the woods.  The path is a little before the day care yard.  It is NOT necessary to have to cross a wire fence- head further south and then come back north a bit to find cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Had to remove this cache because it was on property that was leased to someone by the state. I could have moved it just a short distance and been ok on state property with permission but didn't want to take a chance that someone would be on the leased property. Will try to get another one in the general area before long.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is more challenging as it resides on the west side of Cedar Mt. in the Belknap range.  It is easiest to find by starting on an old logging road that is .7 miles south of the Mt. Major parking lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start on the old logging road (.7 miles south of Mt. Major parking lot) and climb (446 feet) until you reach the end at the T.  Turn left at the T and climb up the trail until you reach the rock cliffs at the base of Cedar Mt (2/10 mile).  If you go west a couple of hundred feet below the mountain (requires bushwacking), you can then climb up to the top more easily.  Once on the top, follow the ridge west until you see the large rock marker.  You will then have to bushwack your way down westward to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It is not called Rock of ages for nothing.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The trail leads down to the swamp near Cedar Mt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location is 250 feet off of a trail that is south of the 3 Mt. Major trails.  The trail can be reached quickest from a chained (but but OK to hike) old logging road which is  7/10 of a mile south of the main parking lot for Mt. Major.  Head up the trail and at the T turn right and go 446 feet.  The swamp trail heads off to the left.  This trail is not one of the commonly hiked MT. Major trails but is very easy and wide.  It has far reaching hikes if you continue it, along with Mt. Mack, Mt. Anna, Straightback Mt. and others in the Belknap Range.  If you park in the Mt. Major parking lot, head out on the Orange trail (south most  from the parking lot) and go left at the first trail (.33 miles from the parking lot, then right on the swamp trail (.42 miles).  There is some easy bushwacking to get from the trail to the cache</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A nice hike with excellent views of Lake Winnipesaukee.  The summit is 2,382 feet above sea level and the main trail is 1.75 miles long.  Plan on about 45 min to an hour and 15 min to reach the cache (depending how fast you walk)  The main trail has some quite steep spots closer to the top but has the most views.  Take the Brook trail to bypass the steep ridges. Take the main trail down for the views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ammo box with a camera log book etc. (please note your picture number)&lt;br/&gt;Some really cool things as well as some stuff for the little ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions:&lt;br/&gt;- Comment By (HikeNH.com Admin) &lt;br/&gt;Mount Major is very easy to find.  The parking lot is located right off rte 11 along the side of Alton Bay in Alton.  The parking lot is clearly marked, you can't miss it. (N 43* 31.158  / W 71* 16.428)&lt;br/&gt;Take route 11 north and follow the east side of Alton bay.  It's right there about one mile up on the left&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** I have upgraded the difficulty as several cachers have made coments that it is not an easy hike.  It is steep in some sections.  I still would call it an easy hike, but it is not an easy walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK81FD - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 31.158 W 071° 16.428&lt;br/&gt;Parking area at the base of the mountian, off route 11</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From the peak at Mr. Phippen's Hut walk SW about a tenth of a mile to a flat rock with another rock in front of it.  (N43*30.712 / W71*17.330)  Stand on the rock and walk directly onto the smaller rock (like stairs) and continue (approx south) around 100-125 feet.  There is a dead tree with a spruce tree right behind it.  It is under the branches of the spruce.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The last few days were not that good for geocaching around but we gave it a try this morning in Laconia.
Hope the weather will improve so we can find a lot of caches...
Thank you for placing these caches for our enjoyment while traveling or vacationing.</groundspeak:text>

The park workers were cleaning up the lot and pumping the outhouse when I arrived.  Since there wasn't anyone else around it was a good chance to scamper up into the woods and make the quick find.  Note that where the cache is currently placed is not winter friendly.

While here we took the time to finish what we started two years ago, the entire Moat Mountain series. Most of the caches on this side were signed by the Wing-nuts to save space in the logs but the few between South Moat and valley between it and  North Moat we signed as the Marblettes as the other two members of the group did not join us.

It's near a scenic overlook at 2753 feet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had a weekend away at Bretton Woods, NH with the family (Winter 2010). In celebration of our cousin's birthday, we planted this cache at the top of West Mountain at Bretton Woods ski resort.  This is the first cache that I planted with five year old daugther.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the cache, you need to hike (or take the chairlift) to the top of West Mountain. Off the back of West Mountain is a scenic overlook (at 2753 feet), which is where we hid the cache. The cache is hidden under a pine tree and next to a boulder. We had to work to plant the cache as there was 4+ feet of snow on the ground at the time.</groundspeak:long_description>

Bring your altimeter or laser level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alleged summit of South Carter Mtn used to be marked by a signpost on the Carter-Moriah Trail although it was obvious that the ground was higher on a ledge a few feet back in the woods. The sign was removed a couple years ago when the post got rotten - allegedly it was easier to carry out the sign than carry in a new post or nail it to a tree, and official Forest Service policy is that hikers don't care about signs anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But a look at the USGS map shows that South Carter is actually a twin summit and the trail misses the south summit entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a canteen wired to an evergreen at or near the highest point of the south bump. If your GPS points elsewhere, ignore it and head uphill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My GPS gave an altitude reading of 4502-3 at both bumps, obviously bogus but showing they are fairly close. Please post any readings you get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The tile actually looks better than this picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;

Actual Within GPS's 20-30 feet Co-Ords of the Plaque will be
put here in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt; Looks like enough snow has left to make the climb in about that time.
********************************
My friend and I both grew up in this small town. &lt;br /&gt;
Went to the same schools together, but never really hung around. &lt;br /&gt;
She was the more the quite type, where i was a wild child.&lt;br /&gt;
Much later in life I at times hung with Her, and her husband.&lt;br /&gt;
 I always had a caring feeling for her. Never much cared for her husband. &lt;br /&gt;
He just didn't seem to treat her well.&lt;br /&gt;
I never persuded anything much from her. Just always seemed to care.&lt;br /&gt;
After some time I married, and raised 2 step children.&lt;br /&gt;
Well as time went on i lost touch with her, &lt;br /&gt;
and I began to travel out of town for my wife to go to school for Nursing,&lt;br /&gt;
 and i for Welding schooling, and 	work. &lt;br /&gt;
Never to see my ol friend for many years. &lt;br /&gt;
Then my wife, and I moved back to that small town to work.&lt;br /&gt; 
Bought a house for a while,continued to raise kids, and all that.&lt;br /&gt; 
Then one day while shopping at a local store i see my old friend again.&lt;br /&gt;
I go over, and say hi. We chat just a bit. This happens just a few more 	times.&lt;br /&gt;
She now is raising a daughter alone. Separated from an abusive husband.&lt;br /&gt;
Well it wasn't much longer I lost touch again.&lt;br /&gt;
Either I moved to Houlton, or she did to New Hampshire?&lt;br /&gt;
It was long ago. Many years past.&lt;br /&gt;
My wife became a Traveling Nurse, and we traveled for many years.&lt;br /&gt;
My wife, and I returned to Maine one year, and my wife became sick.&lt;br /&gt; 
After surgery we stayed in Maine. Moved to Southern Maine,&lt;br /&gt;
and have lived in 3 different towns now.&lt;br /&gt;
I have family in Millinocket, so I travel there a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
One day my sister tells me she seen Brenda at the shopping mart.&lt;br /&gt;
My sister was good friends with her back in them years way back.&lt;br /&gt;
My sister tells me Brenda is now sick, and on oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;
Also tells me the houseing complex where she now lives.&lt;br /&gt;
I tell myself I have to go see her, and I do.&lt;br /&gt;
Our first meeting went quite well. She tells me she had Cancer, and had half a lung removed.&lt;br /&gt;
She now has severe COPD. She seemed to be in very happy good state of mind knowing this.&lt;br /&gt;
Positive attitude. And very happy to see a old friend.&lt;br /&gt;
In time I find out why. It seems most her friends have moved.&lt;br /&gt;
 Her family that she moved back for didn't really give a crabs ass about her, &lt;br /&gt;
and just a lot of other people seemed scared of a person who has to bring a oxygen tank along with her everyplace she goes.&lt;br /&gt;
Well after a few times visiting her we became very good friends.&lt;br /&gt; 
I ask why we never became close before. &lt;br /&gt;
She tells me because of my wild, and crazy ways. 
I understood.&lt;br /&gt;
 Well a few more visits, &lt;br /&gt;
I decide I have to be this girls friend for the rest of what she has for life.&lt;br /&gt; 
I know people in this condition don't live long.&lt;br /&gt;
I begin spending as much time as possible with her,&lt;br /&gt; 
and bringing her out doing whatever I can that she can do.&lt;br /&gt;
I bring her for scenic rides, shopping, and even took the time to bring her out atving.&lt;br /&gt;
Extra tanks, and all. Anything she wanted to do within her means I took her out to do.&lt;br /&gt;
She had a twin sister in Berwick, Maine. She after a while talked her into moving there.&lt;br /&gt;
I moved her. I continued to make the time to travel there to do the same things.&lt;br /&gt;
These things became less, and less after a while as her health went down hill. COPD is a bad disease.&lt;br /&gt;
I was always there for her to make her smile. To listen to her in times of sadness.&lt;br /&gt;
I found time to get her to doctors appointments no one else to get her to.&lt;br /&gt;
Her family in Berwick wasn't much better than her family in Millinocket. &lt;br /&gt;
The move wasn't a good thing for her to do. Well i held up my promise, and continued to do all i could for her.&lt;br /&gt;
After a while she became very sick, and in the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;
From there into a Hospice Facility. I went to visit, and no way in hell was my friend going to be there to die.&lt;br /&gt;
I got her ass back home, and back on her needed meds,&lt;br /&gt;
and off those heavy doses of Morphine. She did fairly well for a few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
I spend most my time off there.&lt;br /&gt;
In a while she passed. Spring of 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
I have to say...Her family was a bunch of selfish ass's threw all this.&lt;br /&gt;
Except for Heather, and her family. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
Well there...I feel much better.&lt;br /&gt; 
I, Earlthepearl, put this TerraCache ( Marble Plaque ) out in Memory of my dear friend  Brenda King.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no treasure,&lt;br /&gt;
except the treasure of being up here on this Mountain enjoying the Views around you.&lt;br /&gt;
Remember this: Life on this Earth is very short. Don't let the rat-race make you forget this.&lt;br /&gt; 
Each day you wake up is really the only day you have.&lt;br /&gt; 
Don't worry about the past. Don't worry about tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
Life is now. We see friends, and family die all the time.&lt;br /&gt;
It can be you at any second. None of us know for sure.&lt;br /&gt; 
Try to live your life happy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Try to make people around you smile.&lt;br /&gt; 
Hey!! Be the clown if that's what it takes. That's what i do.&lt;br /&gt;
If you make someone smile, It is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;
If they don't like the way you are, well that's their problem, and get out of my face!&lt;br /&gt;
We're only here for a very short time in this time. SMILE, and make those around you SMILE!&lt;br /&gt;
Please feel free to log in that you came up here, even tho there isn't a log 	book to sign.&lt;br /&gt;
The weather up here is just to extreme in winter months to keep a maintained container with a logbook in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;
Winter can get down to 100+ below zero. &lt;br /&gt;
They're many trails to make this hike.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do your homework before attempting to make this climb.&lt;br /&gt;
Just search Google for: Mount Madison, NH or Mount Adams, NH hikes before attempting.&lt;br /&gt;
Mountain is at 5331 Feet.&lt;br /&gt;
A 4500 foot climb.&lt;br /&gt;
Read the info about the hikes, and trails.&lt;br /&gt;

Summer months please use a bug spray with deet....Deep woods off with at least 25% deet is what i use.&lt;br /&gt;
Ticks seem plentiful in New England areas cause of the deer.&lt;br /&gt;

ruisseau sans nom que j'ai décidé de baptiser Appaloosa ! Cette
géocache traditionnelle est évidemment disponible à tout
géocacheur. Elle contient néanmoins un item spécial pour quiconque
possède la technologie nécessaire.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En plus du carnet du visite devant être signé pour pouvoir
enregistrer un Found, cette cache contient &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.munzee.com/m/OpusTerra/1/&quot;&gt;ce premier Munzee&lt;/a&gt;
déployé en Estrie. Cette cache permet donc aux détenteurs de
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone&quot;&gt;téléphones
intelligents&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;smartphones&lt;/i&gt;) (et seulement ceux-là pour
l'instant) de pouvoir enregistrer un Munzee en plus de cette
géocache.&lt;/p&gt;
L'activité &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.munzee.com/about&quot;&gt;Munzee&lt;/a&gt; est
basée sur les principes élémentaires du géocaching et ajoute une
autre dimension à la chasse. Les Munzee peuvent se présenter sous
n'importe quelle forme mais ils auront toujours un code à barre QR
pouvant être lu par votre appareil. C'est suite à cette lecture
qu'un lien Internet vers le site Munzee sera effectué et que vous
pourrez enregistrer votre découverte. Un Munzee c'est un peu comme
une sorte de Travel Bug mais avec un enregistrement dynamique! On
ne doit cependant pas le ramasser. Il faut absolument le laisser
dans la cache pour les suivants!
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB: Il est préférable que vous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.munzee.com/download&quot;&gt;installiez&lt;/a&gt; l'application
Munzee sur votre appareil avant de vous rendre à cette cache ainsi
que de vous enregistrer sur le site de cette activité.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cette cache est un hommage à un célèbre bédéiste belge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Il est né le 25 juin 1928 à Bruxelles, en Belgique. Après avoir complété ses études à l'Académie royale des beaux-arts de Bruxelles, il trouve du travail dans un studio d'animation.&lt;br/&gt;C'est là qu'il y fait connaissance avec Franquin (Gaston Lagaffe), Morris (Lucky Luke) et Paape (Marc Dacier) avec lesquels il se joindra à la maison d'édition Dupuis en 1945. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ses personnages les plus connus sont sans contredit les Schtroumpfs! Ce sont de petits lutins bleus très malins, qui vivent isolés dans la forêt. Les Schtroumpfs ont été vu pour la première fois dans l'édition du 23 octobre 1958 du Journal de Spirou. Ils n'étaient alors que des personnages secondaires dans une histoire de Johan et Pirlouit intitulée La Flûte à six schtroumpfs. Aujourd'hui, on les retrouve partout: en bande dessinée, en films, en figurines et même en jeu électroniques. Il créera aussi les personnages de Benoît Brisefer et de Poussy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Il décédera le 24 décembre 1992, à Bruxelles, d'une crise cardiaque.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L'énigme:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) Son prénom? (Additionner les chiffre correspondants aux lettres) A=1, B=2, C=3&lt;br/&gt;B) Son nom?&lt;br/&gt;C) Son pseudonyme? &lt;br/&gt;D) Combien d'albums de Schtroumpfs a-t-il scénarisé et dessiné seul? &lt;br/&gt;E) Combien d'années se sont passées entre la parution du premier et du dernier album des Schtroumpfs auxquels il a participé? &lt;br/&gt;F) Lequel de ses amis a créer le célèbre cracoucass? (1 mot)&lt;br/&gt;G) Quel a été le premier mot qui a été substitué par le mot schtroumpf dans son vocabulaire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maintenant, vous devez faire la somme de tous les nombres obtenus puis:&lt;br/&gt;Soustraire le résultat à la coordonnée Nord pour obtenir la latitude de la cache et&lt;br/&gt;Additionner le résultat à la coordonnée Ouest pour obtenir la longitude de la cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voilà, il ne vous reste plus qu'à faire les mathématiques et à signer le log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merci pour votre participation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neau-é  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contenu initial de la cache:&lt;br/&gt;Un carnet de visite&lt;br/&gt;Un crayon&lt;br/&gt;Des figurines&lt;br/&gt;Un jeu de cartes&lt;br/&gt;Une voiture sport&lt;br/&gt;Deux jeux électroniques&lt;br/&gt;Une loupe&lt;br/&gt;Une pièce JFK&lt;br/&gt;Un grelot&lt;br/&gt;Une balle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-PAT  pirouet, kalie00 et Ibug66.&lt;br/&gt;Co-DAT  pic mineur et Jalpine.&lt;br/&gt;Co-TAT  VE2YC et Castor007</groundspeak:long_description>

Pour cette quatrième mystère, la résolution fut assez rapide, un peu de recherche sur le WEB, quelques calculs et hop le géochecker tourne au vert !

Sur le terrain tout est en place et en parfait état !

Merci beaucoup &quot;neau-é&quot; pour cette très belle mystère !

Je n'ai rein prit dans la cache car je crois que ce serait une bonne idée de suivre le thème, donc que les gens apportent un schtroumpf pour en prendre un.

Merci de m'avoir fait découvrir le merveilleux monde du créateur des schtroumpfs !!!

Elle a été schtroumpfante cette cache même si elle m'a fait schtroumpfer dans la recherche!!

Ce parc linéaire en bordure du lac Aylmer est une pure perle de votre région [8D].
On a adoré notre marche agrémentée par la lecture des panneaux relatant l'histoire générale et les faits marquants dont le feu de 1899.
Cette cache fût une petite sournoise qui même si elle est bien exactement au PZ, elle se sera laissé désirer plus qu'à son tour :smile:!

En route vers Thetford, on s'arrête à Beaulac histoire de mieux connaître cet endroit grâce à votre invitation géocachique [;)].
Premièrement, disons que ce nom de village lui va très bien :grin:. L'étendue d'eau en question est on ne peut plus calme ce matin et c'est tout simplement magnifique d'observer cette surface réfléchissante [8D].
Sans doute dû au fait qu'il n'y avait personne sur les lieux, cette première cache fût trouvée sans difficulté.
On poursuit donc notre randonnée vers la [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=936b9815-2f96-4067-bb59-ad204da9168c]cache suivante[/url].

Un endroit certes moins charmeur que celui où les deux autres géocaches nous ont conviées précédemment mais néanmoins bien utile pour conserver la qualité de votre environnement.
Quelques canards s'envolent à notre arrivée et puis on s'en va faire un petit tour aux abords de la pinède pour terminer la visite.

Co-FTF pour les 4 caches.  Certaines nous on donne un peu plus de fil à retordre et se sont laissé désirer un peu plus longtemps avant de se laisser attrapper.
Belle petite sortie familiale et matinale et le petit Krapot était très fier de trouver ses 4 premiers FTF et aussi de dépasser le 300 caches de trouvées.

Pour la deuxième fois en quelques jours de nouvelles géocaches font lever un retraité pour aller à la chasse aux caches à 5h30 du matin.
Par un temps venteux et pluvieux je sors du Camping Tropical pour être sûr d'être le Premier A Trouver ces caches.
La petite vlimeuse m'a fait chercher pendant plus de 20 minutes...
Mission accomplie et effectivement PAT.
Merci Lepidoptart d'avoir placé ces caches pas trop difficiles dans notre coin.</groundspeak:text>

Cette nouvelle cache n'était pas trop loin de mon camping.
À l'heure où je suis allé à sa recherche je pensais bien que je trouverais une belle signature déjà inscrite sur le log.
Mais non, tout était immaculé donc fier d'être le PAT pour La Souche.
Merci Krapot pour la cache bien camouflée.</groundspeak:text>

Ces nouvelles petites caches nous on fait lever de bonne heure ce matin...
Partis avec le petit-fils Krapot à 5h30 ce matin en espérant qu'un matinal géocacheur  n'avait pas été plus rapide que nous.
Co-FTF pour les 4 caches.  Certaines nous on donne un peu plus de fil à retordre et se sont laissé désirer un peu plus longtemps avant de se laisser attrapper.
Belle petite sortie familiale et matinale et le petit Krapot était très fier de trouver ses 4 premiers FTF et aussi de dépasser le 300 caches de trouvées.
Merci bien Guy et Hélène d'avoir posé ces caches pas trop loin de notre camping. Ne vous gênez pas pour en placer d'autres autour avant qu'on soit reparti vers le sud pour l'hiver.</groundspeak:text>

Ces nouvelles petites caches nous on fait lever de bonne heure ce matin...
Partis avec le petit-fils Krapot à 5h30 ce matin en espérant qu'un matinal géocacheur  n'avait pas été plus rapide que nous.
Co-FTF pour les 4 caches.  Certaines nous on donne un peu plus de fil à retordre et se sont laissé désirer un peu plus longtemps avant de se laisser attrapper.
Belle petite sortie familiale et matinale et le petit Krapot était très fier de trouver ses 4 premiers FTF et aussi de dépasser le 300 caches de trouvées.
Merci bien Guy et Hélène d'avoir posé ces caches pas trop loin de notre camping. Ne vous gênez pas pour en placer d'autres autour avant qu'on soit reparti vers le sud pour l'hiver.</groundspeak:text>

Trouvée facilement au bon endroit selon la directive de Mr. Garmin...
Moins drôle...  Après avoir trouvé la cache je me suis rendu au camping et j'ai dû ramasser les feuilles sur mon terrain. 
Pourtant je les avais toutes ramassées l'an dernier et l'année précédente...
Merci pour la cache !</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pour les amateurs de balades à vélo, de beaux sentiers à découvrir
le long de la Rivière-aux-sables et le lac Kénogami.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Le lac Kénogami (de kéno et gami , qui signifie Long lac, dans la
langue Innue Montagnais) est un réservoir artificiel situé dans
l'arrondissement de Jonquière de la ville de Saguenay.
&lt;p&gt;Ayant pour bassin hydrographique principal le Parc des
Laurentides (par les rivières Pikauba, Cyriac et aux-Écorces), ce
plan d'eau, d'une superficie de 57 km² et d'un volume de 380
millions m³ d'eau, est la source des rivières Chicoutimi et
aux-Sables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sur ses rives, on trouve la municipalité d'Hébertville, de
Larouche et les anciennes municipalités de Laterrière et
Lac-Kénogami faisant aujourd'hui partie de la ville de
Saguenay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les eaux du réservoir sont retenues par les barrages
Portage-des-Roches, Pibrac-Est et Pibrac-Ouest ainsi que les digues
Ouiqui, Baie-Cascouia, Moncouche, Coulée-Gagnon, Creek Outlet et
Pibrac (Est et Ouest).&lt;br /&gt;
Lac-Kénogami est l'ancienne municipalité la moins peuplée
constituant Saguenay avec ses 2141 habitants. On appelait ses
résidents les Kénogamois et les Kénogamoises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Je me suis inspiré d'une cache de Cablevision, de la série &quot;Chasse
aux caches 2010&quot; à Val-Cartier.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pour les amateurs de balades à vélo, de beaux sentiers à découvrir
le long de la Rivière-aux-sables et le lac Kénogami.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Le lac Kénogami&lt;/h2&gt;
De kéno et gami , qui signifie Long lac dans la langue Innue
Montagnais, c'est un réservoir artificiel situé dans
l'arrondissement de Jonquière de la ville de Saguenay.
&lt;p&gt;Ayant pour bassin hydrographique principal le Parc des
Laurentides (par les rivières Pikauba, Cyriac et aux-Écorces),ce
plan d'eau, d'une superficie de 57 km² et d'un volume de 380
millions m³ d'eau, est la source des rivières Chicoutimi e
aux-Sables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sur ses rives, on trouve la municipalité d'Hébertville, de
Larouche et les anciennes municipalités de Laterrière et
Lac-Kénogami faisant aujourd'hui partie de la ville de
Saguenay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les eaux du réservoir sont retenues par les barrages
Portage-des-Roches, Pibrac-Est et Pibrac-Ouest ainsi que les digues
Ouiqui, Baie-Cascouia, Moncouche, Coulée-Gagnon, Creek Outlet et
Pibrac (Est et Ouest). Lac-Kénogami est l'ancienne municipalité la
moins peuplée constituant Saguenay avec ses 2141 habitants. On
appelait ses résidents les Kénogamois et les Kénogamoises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;La cache&lt;/h2&gt;
Vous aurez à découvrir un indice dans le porte-cache. Rien de très
compliqué. Je me suis inspiré d'une cache de Cablevision pour
confectionner cette cache. Merci à Cablevision pour cette belle
inspiration à faire connaître à notre communauté.&lt;br /&gt;
La cache contient un carnet de visite et un &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.munzee.com/&quot;&gt;Munzee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Les coordonnées indiquées plus haut sont celles de l'entrée des

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Le Boisé Verdone&lt;/h1&gt;
Un endroit peu connu du public et qui gagne à être découvert. On a
gardé le coin sauvage à part une carrière et une autoroute tout
près.&lt;br /&gt;
En sillonnant les sentiers, vous apprendrez peut être quelque chose
sur la nature des environs. Au plus court en suivant les sentiers,
il y a 400m sur une direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les données &quot;&lt;i&gt;EXIF&lt;/i&gt;&quot; des photos attachées indiquent les

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;La &quot;Mystère&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;
Pour trouver les coordonnées, vous devrez calculer l'orthocentre du
triangle formé par les 3 &quot;Waypoints&quot; indiqués plus bas.&lt;br /&gt;
L'orthocentre d'un triangle est situé aux intersections de trois
lignes (hauteurs). Chaque hauteur part d'un vertex et est
perpendiculaire à son côté opposé. Pour le calcul, j'ai utilisé le
programme &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expertgps.com/&quot;&gt;ExpertGPS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">À la suite de ses études commerciales au Collège de Lévis et à l'école militaire de Québec entre 1864 et 1870 (il entreprend également une année de classe de latin), Alphonse Desjardins entreprend une courte carrière militaire de deux ans (1869-1871), d'abord dans le 17e bataillon de milice volontaire de Lévis. Il participe ensuite à une expédition militaire à la Rivière-Rouge, organisée par la gouvernement canadien. De retour à Lévis, il commence une carrière de journaliste à L'Écho de Lévis sous les ordres de Isidore-Noël Belleau, de 1872 à 1876. Par la suite, Desjardins poursuit sa carrière au Canadien, journal implanté dans la Ville de Québec. Après trois ans, Desjardins abandonne le journalisme pour se tourner vers le métier d'éditeur des débats à l'Assemblée législative du Québec (aujourd'hui l'Assemblée nationale du Québec). Après onze ans à ce poste (nous sommes alors en 1889), Desjardins apprend que le gouvernement d'Honoré Mercier va cesser de subventionner la publication des débats. Une controverse entoure cet épisode mal connu de la vie du fondateur des caisses populaires. Des hypothèses, cependant fort douteuses, comme le mentionne l'historien Pierre Poulin, tendent vers une dispute entre Mercier et Desjardins. Il est, à ce jour, impossible de savoir quel est la véritable raison de la perte d'emploi de Desjardins.&lt;br /&gt;Agé de 35 ans, Desjardins reprend la plume et fonde, à Lévis, le 9 juillet 1891, le journal L'Union Canadienne, qui connait une existence de trois mois seulement. Mais l'implication de Desjardins auprès du Parti Conservateur va lui permettre, le 22 avril 1892, d'entrer à la Chambre des Communes du Canada à titre de sténographe français au Parlement canadien. Il conserve cet emploi jusqu'en 1917, au moment où il prend sa retraite pour des raisons de santé : M. Desjardins est alors atteint d'un mal incurable nommé l'urémie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;En 1897, il est préoccupé par le problème de l'usure et le fait que les banques canadiennes exclusivement anglophonnes refusent de prêter aux Québécois systématiquement. Cette pratique de leur part existe encore pour les Amérindiens (documenté dans la presse du Québec). Face à cette situation, il entreprend trois ans de recherches soigneuses et de correspondance avec les fondateurs des mouvements européens d'épargne et de crédit en coopérative. Parmi ces fondateurs, nous pouvons nommer l'italien Luigi Luzzatti, les allemands Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen et Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch et l'anglais Henry W. Wolf, auteur du volume People's Bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fondation de la première caisse d'épargne du Québec&lt;br /&gt;Le 6 décembre 1900, lui et sa femme Marie-Clara Dorimène Roy-Desjardins, fondent ensemble la première caisse populaire en Amérique du Nord à Lévisau Québec. Elle est nommée la Caisse populaire de Lévis et elle ouvre ses portes le 23 janvier 1901. Cette première caisse est à l'origine du Mouvement des caisses populaires Desjardins, le plus grand groupe financier coopératif de langue française en Amérique du nord. De son vivant, Alphonse Desjardins participe à la fondation de 163 caisses, dont 18 hors-Québec en Ontario et 9 aux États-Unis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Décès d'Alphonse Desjardins&lt;br /&gt;La maladie a raison de lui. Alphonse Desjardins meurt le 31 octobre 1920, six jours avant son 66e anniversaire. Il a droit à d'imposantes funérailles, auxquelles assistent de nombreux représentants de l'Église catholique et des gouvernements du Québec et du Canada. Il est inhumé le 4 novembre au cimetière Mont-Marie de Lévis.&lt;br /&gt;Source: Wikipedia&lt;br /&gt;La cache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Un callepin (c'est une Nano);&lt;br /&gt;    * Ayez votre crayon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coordonnées de la cache :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N 48 23.ILÈ&lt;br /&gt;W 071 03.ISY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * I= Le nombre de caisses qu'Alphonse Desjardins a fondé au États-Unis;&lt;br /&gt;    * L= L'année du siècle dernier où la première caisse a été fondée;&lt;br /&gt;    * È= Le jour de septembre où Alphonse épousa Marie-Clara-Dorimène;&lt;br /&gt;    * S= Le jour de naissance d'Alphonse Desjardins;&lt;br /&gt;    * Y= Non seulement il la fonda cette année-là, mais quel jour était-ce?</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Les coordonnées indiquées sont celles du stationnement un peu au
centre de la série qui vous permettra de trouver les coordonnées.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Vous trouverez
les indices vous permettant de trouver les coordonnées de cette
&quot;Multi&quot; en visitant les caches indiquées plus bas.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Les Actionnaires (marché boursier)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching-saglac.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L'actionnaire est le propriétaire d'une fraction d'une
entreprise ayant un statut de société commerciale. A ce titre, il
détient des actions de cette société dont chacune représente une
part de son capital. Il est donc co-propriétaire — avec
d'autres actionnaires — de la totalité de ce capital.&lt;br /&gt;
L'actionnaire est l'un des partenaires financiers de la société et
favorise son développement économique par l'apport de ses capitaux.
Sa prise de risque financier est alors rémunérée par des dividendes
versés par l'entreprise à chacun des propriétaires d'actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L'actionnariat d'une société est l'ensemble de ses actionnaires,
autrement dit ses possesseurs d'une part du capital de celle-ci
sous forme d'actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C'est un principe purement &quot;capitaliste&quot;. Les cours de bourse
résultent du jeu de l'offre et la demande. Lorsque la demande
l'emporte sur l'offre, les cours montent, ce qui réduit le nombre
de personnes désirant acheter et augmente le nombre de personnes
désirant vendre, jusqu'à ce que l'offre et la demande
s'équlibrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;L'offre et la demande&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le tableau ci-dessous démontre ce qui détermine le juste prix
d'un titre négocié en bourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L'offre et la demande dépendent de multiples facteurs. Si les
marchés fonctionnent correctement et les investisseurs recherchent
leur profit financier de manière rationnelle, le cours d'une action
ne doit dépendre que des bénéfices futurs de l'entreprise. Lorsque
la santé financière de l'entreprise parait s'améliorer, ou lorsque
la situation économique semble plus favorable, le cours de l'action
a donc tendance à monter. Dans le cas inverse, il a tendance à
baisser. Différents travaux ont montré toutefois que les
fluctuations des cours ne peuvent être expliquées par ces seuls
facteurs. Les baisses de 2008 et 2009 relèvent de la perte de
confiance des investisseurs sur la rentabilité des entreprises.&lt;/p&gt;

Il voulait illustrer la différence entre un nombre inimaginable et l'infini de l'univers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C'est ce mot qui est à l'origine du nom de la société Google, ce nombre ayant marqué l'imagination des fondateurs : &quot;Google a choisi ce terme pour symboliser sa mission : organiser l'immense volume d'information disponible sur le Web.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Il faut au minimum 333 bits pour représenter ce nombre.&lt;br/&gt;En effet 2333 = 17 498 005 798 264 095 394 980 017 816 940 970 922 825 355 447 145 699 491 406 164 851 279 623 993 595 007 385 788 105 416 184 430 592.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le gogol n'est pas utilisé scientifiquement, il sert surtout à l'enseignement des mathématiques. Kasner l'a créé afin d'illustrer la différence entre un nombre aussi grand et l'infini. En effet, bien qu'un gogol soit énorme, bien supérieur au nombre de particules dans l'Univers (1080 et des poussières), il est facile de l'écrire en notation conventionnelle, comme suit :&lt;br/&gt;1 gogol = 10100&lt;br/&gt;10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000.&lt;br/&gt;2333&lt;br/&gt;17 498 005 798 264 095 394 980 017 816 940 970 922 825 355 447 145 699 491 406 164 851 279 623 993 595 007 385 788 105 416 184 430 592.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10gogol (un chiffre 1 suivi d'un gogol de zéros) est nommé un gogolplex; ce nombre est inutilisable dans la pratique car il n'y a pas assez de matière dans l'univers pour l'écrire.&lt;br/&gt;Gogolplex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ce nombre n'est qu'une curiosité ayant reçue un nom. Il n'est pas un nombre remarquable pour ses propriétés mathématiques, ni un nombre ayant une signification dans une branche de la science. D'ailleurs, dans ces domaines, il existe des nombres remarquables encore plus grand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ce nombre a donné son nom au :&lt;br/&gt;Googleplex, le siège de l'entreprise Google;&lt;br/&gt;Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light, un ordinateur très puissant dans Le Guide du voyageur galactique de Douglas Adams.&lt;br/&gt;Fondateurs de Google&lt;br/&gt;Larry Page&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lawrence Edward Page dit Larry Page, est un informaticien américain et cofondateur du site internet et moteur de recherche Google. Il est actuellement président et directeur produits de l'entreprise. Avec un patrimoine estimé à près de 22 milliards de dollars, il fait partie des trente plus grosses fortunes mondiales.&lt;br/&gt;Il est né le 26 mars 1973 à Ann Arbor dans le Michigan de Carl Page, pionnier de l'informatique. Il a obtenu un Bachelor of Science en ingénierie et en informatique, avec mention, à l'Université du Michigan. Il est également titulaire d'un master en informatique de l'Université Stanford dans la Silicon Valley en Californie et d'un MBA honoris causa de l'Instituto de Empresa à Madrid.&lt;br/&gt;Larry Page commença une thèse à l'Université Stanford sous la direction de Terry Winograd. C'est à Stanford que Larry Page et Sergey Brin (qui avait commencé une thèse lui aussi) se rencontrent et que commencera l'aventure Google. Larry Page est l'inventeur du procédé permettant le classement des pages Web en fonction de leur popularité.&lt;br/&gt;En 2002, le Forum économique mondial lui décerne le titre de &quot;Leader international de l'économie du futur&quot; et en 2004, il reçoit le prix Marconi.&lt;br/&gt;Sergueï Brin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Il naît le 21 août 1973 à Moscou dans une famille juive, et émigre en 1979 avec ses parents aux États-Unis, à Palo Alto dans la Silicon Valley en Californie.&lt;br/&gt;En 1990, il débute ses études à l'Université du Maryland où il obtient en 1993 un Bachelor of Science en mathématiques et informatique. Il les poursuit à l'Université Stanford en Californie où il décroche un master en informatique. Après avoir obtenu son master, il se rend à Stanford pour commencer une thèse en Informatique (Ph.D in computer science). C'est ici que Sergey Brin rencontre Larry Page avec qui il va travailler sur un projet de moteur de recherche internet qui deviendra Google.&lt;br/&gt;Trouver les coordonnées...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pour obtenir les coordonnées, vous devrez, dans un premier temps, trouver sur quelle Technologie repose principalement l'exploitation du moteur de recherche Google.&lt;br/&gt;Google&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ce mot (2 mots anglais réunis) vous servira de clé pour décrypter les codes ci-dessous, selon la méthode de cryptage de Playfair (Playfair Cipher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 48° 25.(CR SZ YR PU XS YY)&lt;br/&gt;W 071° 04.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Au coût d'environ 13 millions $, on a construit un nouvel aréna à
Chicoutimi en 2009. C'est durant sa construction qu'on a décidé de
nommer le bâtiment du nom d'un de nos athlètes régional: Pierre
Lavoie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pierre s'est découvert athlète sur la tard. Maintenant champion du
monde de sa catégorie au prestigieux IronMan d'Hawaii, il est aussi
un orateur et un conférencier reconnu du grand public.&lt;br /&gt;
Sa dernière mission: faire bouger les jeunes grâce au Mois de
l’éducation physique et du sport étudiant (MEPSÉ) et ses
&quot;Cubes-énergie&quot;. À suivre...&lt;br /&gt;
Voici quelques liens:&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Une cache facile dans le Quartier du Bassin, arrondissement de
Chicoutimi, Saguenay.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Un peu d'histoire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avant la construction des ponts reliant les 2 rives de
Chicoutimi, le quartier du Bassin était l'endroit où
débarquaient diverses marchandises par bateau. Un quai
assurait le service de traversiers. Le &quot;Service des Traversiers&quot;
entre Chicoutimi et Saint-Anne (1865-1933) était un service
municipal payant règlementé par la
municipalité de Chicoutimi (aujourd'hui un arrondissement de
la ville de Saguenay) instauré en 1865 afin de rendre facile
et abordable le transport des marchandises entre la ville de
Chicoutimi et la rive Nord de la rivière Saguenay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Les origines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depuis la colonisation de l'actuel territoire de Chicoutimi, la
traversée du Saguenay fut toujours d'une importance
capitale. Vers 1845, les moyens de transport pour parvenir à
faire transiter les marchandises et les passagers entre les deux
rives du Saguenay étaient totalement archaïques. Les
colons utilisaient, à cette époque, de longs canots
creusés dans de grands pins pour transporter le
bétail, les denrées et les passagers.&lt;br /&gt;
Avec le temps et la demande de la population sans cesse croissante
sur les deux rives, les embarcations se raffinèrent et
passèrent de chaloupes mues par rames à de grands
chalands. En l'espace de 20 ans, de nombreux habitants des deux
rives offraient, avec les embarcations qu'ils possédaient,
la traversée en demandant le prix qu'ils voulaient et sans
régularité. Le désordre,
l'irrégularité et le prix du transport entre les deux
rives provoquèrent de nombreuses plaintes chez les citoyens
des deux villages qui présentèrent une requête
au Conseil de comté pour fixer le prix et les heures de
traversée.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;La règlementation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le 17 avril 1865, dans le village de Chicoutimi, le Conseil de
comté présente la requête des citoyens pour
normaliser les services de traversier. On adopte alors une
réglementation qui régularise les heures, le
coût, les itinéraires et les licences de
traverse.&lt;br /&gt;
Une personne possédant une licence de traverse se devait
faire un minimum de cinq traverses par jour de semaine et trois
traverses par jour de fin de semaine. Également, il se
devait obligatoirement faire traverser les cas urgents à
toute heure du jour ou de la nuit.&lt;br /&gt;
Un péage fut également établi par le village
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 1 – Pour un cheval ou une jument attelée
sur une voiture quelconque. Un passage : trente sous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 2 – Pour un cheval ou une jument. Un passage : 1
schelin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 3 – Pour chaque bête à cornes d'un
an. Un passage : 1 schelin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 4 – Pour chaque bête à cornes
au-dessous d'un an. Un passage : Six sous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 5 – Pour chaque cochon et chaque mouton avec les
petits de l'année. Un passage : six sous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 6 – Pour chaque cent livres pesant, le bois
excepté. Un passage : 3 sous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 7 – Pour chaque personne au-dessus de sept ans.
Un passage : six sous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article 8 – Pour chaque enfant au-dessous de sept ans en
état de marcher. Un passage : deux sous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L'itinéraire du traversier variait selon les points
d'arrivée à Chicoutimi. Dans le village de St-Anne
(Township Tremblay), le traversier partait de la
propriété de John Guay et se rendait dans un des
trois points d'arrivée dans le quartier du Bassin à
Chicoutimi.&lt;br /&gt;
L'octroi de la licence de traversier coûtait un dollar. Le
traversier devait rester en service de la débâcle
jusqu'aux glaces d'automne. La première infraction à
la réglementation était passible d'une amende de 2
dollars et toute offense supplémentaire se voyait punie par
une amende de 4 dollars. La règle s'appliquait à tous
les traversiers qui recevait une rémunération pour
leur service même s'ils ne détenaient pas de
licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Les traversiers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De 1865 à 1874, le service de traverse fut assuré
par des chaloupes et des chalands qui donnaient un service plus ou
moins adéquat. En 1871, une course fut organisée
entre un chaland et une chaloupe, le chaland gagna et remporta 25
dollars. Pendant les trois années qui suivirent le chaland
des frères Gagnon assura le service. En 1874, les
frères Maguy, avec leur bateau à vapeur, obtinrent le
contrat de traverse. Tous les bateaux, à partir de celui-ci
seront à vapeur.&lt;br /&gt;
Ce service fut aboli en 1933 après la construction du pont
de Sainte-Anne qui le rendit obsolète.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le déluge de 1996 a transformé
considérablement l'aspect des lieux et les ouvrages que vous
voyez en sont le résultat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asseyez-vous et prenez un instant pour observer les mouvements
de l'eau à l'intérieur du Bassin!&lt;/p&gt;

La plupart de mes amis (les Boivin et les Bilodeau) habitaient ce secteur. Nos jeux se limitaient à ce qu'on pouvait trouver: des objets sans valeur qu'on s'échangeait contre d'autres sans plus de valeur (est-ce que cela vous dit quelque chose?).&lt;br/&gt;On essayait de se faire des vélos avec d'autres vélos, autant que possible avec des freins; ce n'était pas toujours possible. On se cassait la gueule, mais on avait du plaisir!&lt;br/&gt;L'hiver, on réussissait à former 2 équipes de hockey. À sept, parfois 8, on devait composer 2 équipes. Enlevez 2 joueurs pour garder les buts, et imaginez le reste. Encore là, on avait un plaisir fou, même dans les climats les plus extrêmes.&lt;br/&gt;Une équipe de l'Office National du film a déjà filmé une scène d'une de nos parties de hockey. Ces prises devaient faire partie d'un film devant être présenté à l'exposition universelle à Osaka au Japon.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Les coordonnées indiquées plus haut sont celles du
stationnement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;L'apothicaire&lt;/h1&gt;
 Les
apothicaires étaient les précurseurs des pharmaciens. Ils
préparaient et vendaient les drogues et médicaments pour les
malades. « Apothecarius » vient du latin et signifie « boutiquier »
ce qui correspondait aux pratiques des XIIIe et XIVe siècles, où la
boutique était l'élément qui différenciait le commerçant sérieux du
charlatan de passage.&lt;br /&gt;
En 1777, à la suite d'un décret de Louis XVI remplaçant le jardin
des apothicaires par le Collège de pharmacie, les apothicaires
prennent le nom de pharmaciens et obtiennent, après de nombreuses
querelles avec les médecins, les chirurgiens et surtout les
espiciers, l'exclusivité de la préparation des remèdes. Cette
déclaration sépara les corporations d'apothicaires et d'épiciers
reconnaissant ainsi le monopole de la vente des médicaments aux
seuls membres du Collège royal de pharmacie. Il officialisait ainsi
la pharmacie comme une branche de la médecine nécessitant des
études et des connaissances approfondies.
&lt;p&gt;La loi du 21 germinal an XI (11 avril 1803) régira l'exercice de
la pharmacie. Elle interdit aux épiciers-droguistes de vendre des
drogues simples au poids médicinal. Avant cette loi, la pharmacie
n'était régie par aucune législation régulière ; il y avait
cependant une foule d'édits qui la concernaient. L'organisation
moderne de la pharmacie date de cette époque et durant cette
période le mot apothicaire disparut au profit de celui de
pharmacien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En Allemagne, de nos jours, on parle toujours d'Apotheker
pour désigner un pharmacien, et d'Apotheke pour désigner une
pharmacie. Il en va d'ailleurs de même en Russie ; on parle alors
d'aptiéka (??????) pour désigner une pharmacie.&lt;/p&gt;

Les apothicaires mesuraient leurs ingrédients sur une échelle bien
à eux. Vous devrez trouver cette échelle et ainsi découvrir les
coordonnées véritables du site de cache. (Sur le &quot;Net&quot;, des
divergeances existent sur le nombre de grains par scrupule. Une
chose est certaine, le résultat de AAA ne dépasse pas 1 000.) L'image Apothicaire_Table vous aidera à trouver les réponses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AAA: (nombre de grains dans 41 scrupules) + (nombre de dragmes
dans 8 onces) + (nombre de scrupules dans un dragme);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBB: (nombre d'onces dans 10 livres) + (nombre de dragmes dans
10 onces) - (nombre de scrupules dans 1 dragme).&lt;/li&gt;

Elle recevait aux alentour d'une vingtaine de jeunes des six niveaux du primaire, tous ensembles dans ce bâtiment de moins de 10 mètres de façade.&lt;br/&gt;Un poêle à bois occupait le centre de la pièce. De chaque côté, une rangée de pupitres &quot;double&quot; (deux élèves côte à côte derrière la même table de travail). L'hiver, un élève demeurant le plus près de l'école était chargé d'allumer le poêle avant l'arrivée des étudiants de telle sorte que l'on soit confortable dès l'entrée.&lt;br/&gt;L'enseignante (la maîtresse, comme on l'appelait alors) s'occupait des jeunes à tour de rôle, selon leur niveau. Le seul enseignement commun à tous était la classe de dessin, le vendredi après-midi. Les plus vites et futés écoutaient, parfois, le contenu des cours de niveau plus élevé, ce qui a permis à quelques uns de sauter une année, le plus souvent pour passer de la troisième année à la cinquième.&lt;br/&gt;Elle a fermé sa porte dans la seconde moitié des années cinquante, quand a été mis en place le transport scolaire qui, à ce moment-là, utilisait une automobile de type familiale légèrement plus longue que la normale dans laquelle on s'entassait pour se rendre au village.&lt;br/&gt;La cache&lt;br/&gt;Un contenant avec un &quot;log&quot; seulement.

Notez que vous pourriez trouver 2 prix différents. Ce sera celui en bas du dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pour trouver DEF, à partir du même boulevard, prenez la rue Sainte-Marie Nord. Arrivé à l'intersection de Sainte-Marie et Vimy (dans la courbe) se trouve un panneau avec un grand chiffre. Additionnez 307 à ce chiffre. Continuez sur Vimy et au dépanneur, soustrayez le nombre de cents d'économie que vous avez sur l'essence.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Le Combat d'Onésime&lt;br/&gt;Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nous avons déposé une cache en face d’un lac qu’on nomme maintenant : le Grand Marais ou Havre Belle-Rivière. Ce n’est que depuis 1926 qu’il peut prendre le nom de « lac ». Avant le rehaussement des eaux du Lac St-Jean, ce que vous voyez était une immense forêt d’ormes matures qui étaient, à chaque année, innondés par la crue. Le retrait des eaux de crue laissait un limon fertile et permettait à ces arbres de croître de façon exceptionnelle.&lt;br/&gt;Onésime (Tremblay) était à la tête d’un groupe de cultivateurs pour défendre leurs droits à récupérer leurs terres. C’était aussi notre arrière grand-père.&lt;br/&gt;Origine de l'affaire&lt;br/&gt;L'homme d'affaires Benjamin-Alexandre Scott est le premier à s'intéresser de près au potentiel hydro-électrique de la rivière Saguenay. Il était déjà connu dans la région puisqu'il était propriétaire de la plus grande scierie du Lac Saint-Jean, à Roberval. Il y avait fait installé une échelle pour mesurer le niveau du lac. Le point zéro était la moyenne des eaux basses. Au printemps, le débit d'eau pouvait monter à 18 pieds au-dessus de ce point. Pour obtenir un débit régulier à l'année longue, il fallait maintenir le niveau du lac à 17,5 pieds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le 22 juin 1900, après quelques mois de négociations, le gouvernement Marchand (Québec) lui concède pour 6 000 $ les forces hydrauliques du Saguenay de la Chute-à-Caron à l'Île-Maligne. Un autre homme d'affaires, Louis Haggins, reçoit pour 9 000 $ les eaux de la rivière de l'ile Maligne en amont du Saguenay. Une pénalité est prévue si les travaux d'aménagement ne sont pas commencés avant trois ans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haggins et Scott s'associent en 1901 et forment la compagnie Oyame. Le projet est cependant bloqué en 1903, car les cultivateurs de l'endroit, craignant une trop grande montée des eaux du lac, ont fait pression sur le gouvernement pour arrêter le projet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Celui-ci est repris en 1912 par un homme d'affaires américain, James Buchanan Duke, qui a fait fortune dans le marché de la cigarette. Propriétaire de l'American Tobacco Company, il possède 80 % du marché de la cigarette aux États-Unis. Au début du siècle, il a commencé à investir dans le développement hydro-électrique en construisant deux centrales : l'une en Caroline du Nord et l'autre en Caroline du Sud. En 1912, il se rend au Saguenay avec un expert, W. S. Gee, et y perçoit l'importance du potentiel hydro-électrique de la rivière. Il s'associe avec Scott qui accepte de négocier un permis avantageux avec le gouvernement. Duke investira s'il trouve l'opération rentable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duke se trouve bientôt un nouvel associé en la personne de William Price, propriétaire de la Price Brothers, plus grand producteur de papier journal au Canada dont la principale usine est située à Jonquière. Les deux hommes fondent la Quebec Development Corporation, qui doit préparer la construction des barrages le long de la Grande-Décharge et entreprendre l'expropriation des fermiers dont les terres seront affectées par la montée des eaux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le 8 avril 1914, le gouvernement de Lomer Gouin permet à la nouvelle société de construire un barrage sur la Grande-Décharge et d'élever le niveau du lac à 17,5 pieds. Elle a cependant l'obligation « de payer aux propriétaires riverains les dommages que ces travaux pourraient leur causer ». La Quebec Development annonce alors son intention de construire son usine sur l'Île Maligne, tel que déjà préconisé par Scott en 1900.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En 1915, la Quebec Development commence ses travaux d'arpentage et entreprend l'expropriation des terres contigües à la Grande-Décharge. Certains fermiers, dont les terres sont situées aux abords du Lac Saint-Jean, craignent une montée trop haute des eaux et envoient une délégation au premier ministre Gouin pour lui demander de revenir sur sa décision. Elle a à sa tête un homme nommé Onésime Tremblay, fermier prospère de Saint-Jérôme, aujourd'hui Métabetchouan. Elle fait valoir que la montée des eaux du Lac pourrait inonder leurs terres, mais Gouin leur déclare qu'il ne reviendra pas sur sa décision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le Lac est alors monté à un niveau considérable, inondant à jamais des centaines d'hectares de terres cultivables le long de la rive. La lutte de ces cultivateurs pour revenir au statu quo ante a été un échec. C’est ce qu’on appellera ensuite : La tragédie du Lac Saint-Jean. C’est le nom donné, au Québec, par les cultivateurs de l'endroit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les procès des cultivateurs contre la Duke-Price débutent en 1929 et ne sont qu'une source de déception pour eux. En général, les tribunaux rendent en effet un jugement favorable à la compagnie c'est-à-dire qu'elle n'a qu'à payer la valeur marchande des terres disparues et non la valeur productive. Certains cultivateurs emmènent leur cause jusqu'en Comité judiciaire du Conseil privé, qui préfère ne pas rendre de jugement sur cette affaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le comité de défense des cultivateurs se retrouve bientôt endetté et en faillite. Onésime Tremblay lui-même, symbole de la défense des intérêts des fermiers jeannois, est obligé de vendre sa terre. Les résultats de la vente de la terre par encan représentent bien la solidarité des gens à l’époque. Eugénie Lapointe (la brue d’Onésime) avait comme amie de couvent la femme d’un dénommé Gagnon, propriétaire du magasin Gagnon &amp; Frères du haut de la côte, à Chicoutimi. C’est elle, voyant l'annonce de la vente sous Shérif dans le journal, qui a demandé à son homme de concocter une transaction « bidon ». Les personnes présentent à l’encan ont déposé des offres, sans renchérissement. La terre, les animaux et tous les instruments aratoires ont été liquidés à des prix dérisoires. Raoul (le fils d’Onésime et mari d’Eugénie) a remboursé intégralement monsieur Gagnon, capital et intérêts. Ce geste à permis aux 5 générations suivantes de continuer à exploiter la terre jusqu’en 1978, date où elle fut vendue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aujourd'hui, la tragédie du Lac Saint-Jean est l'objet d'une certaine controverse. Les uns croient que le développement hydro-électrique était nécessaire à l'économie de la région; les autres soutiennent que le Lac Saint-Jean a perdu ses plus belles terres agricoles dans l'affaire.&lt;br/&gt;Quelques notes dans un des carnets d’Onésime :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    La Couronne a fait cadastrer ma terre;&lt;br/&gt;    La Couronne me l’a vendue;&lt;br/&gt;    Je l'ai payée et j’ai rempli toutes les conditions;&lt;br/&gt;    Je l’occupe et l’utilise en son entier depuis 70 ans;&lt;br/&gt;    La compagnie Duke-Price arrive au pays et, sans avis préalable, elle inonde ma terre;&lt;br/&gt;    J’ai sur ma propriété tous les titres possibles et la Duke-Price aucun;&lt;br/&gt;    La Duke-Price ne veut même pas me payer ce qu’elle m’a pris;&lt;br/&gt;    Les gouvernants approuvent cet attentat criminel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La cache&lt;br/&gt;Un récipiant cylindrique contenant:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Callepin et crayon.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Description du thème&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Une langue construite et conçue à la fin du XIXe siècle par
Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof dans le but de faciliter la communication
entre personnes de langues différentes, à travers le monde entier.
Zamenhof publia son projet en 1887 sous le nom de Lingvo Internacia
(« Langue internationale »).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sa grammaire se base sur seize règles fondamentales sans
exception. Par sa structure qui procède par enchaînement
d'éléments de base invariables, c'est une langue globalement
agglutinante. Par son vocabulaire, elle est construite a
posteriori, c'est-à-dire que ses bases sont tirées de langues
préexistantes (essentiellement indo-européennes) ; les mots en
dérivent ensuite par l'emploi d'affixes et par
composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De tous les nombreux projets de langue auxiliaire internationale
ayant vu le jour, c'est celle qui a remporté le plus de
succès, et la seule qui soit quelque peu connu du grand public.
Elle est le moyen de communication d'une communauté estimée à
entre cent mille et deux millions de locuteurs, présents dans la
majorité des pays du monde (115 selon l'Ethnologue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Un peu d'histoire&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elle fut composée entre la fin des années 1870 et le début des
années 1880 par Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, un ophtalmologue polonais
issu d'une famille juive de Bialystok (alors en Russie, maintenant
en Pologne), ville alors peuplée de quatre communautés : juive,
polonaise, allemande et biélorusse. Sensible aux tensions qui en
résultaient, Zamenhof voulut créer un moyen de communication
neutre, susceptible d'améliorer la communication et la
compréhension entre les nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Après approximativement dix années de maturation, incluant
diverses traductions et l'écriture d'œuvres originales,
Zamenhof publia la première grammaire en langue russe de la Langue
internationale en juillet 1887, sous la forme d'une brochure
imprimée à ses frais. Suivirent peu après des versions dans de
nombreuses autres langues entre 1887 et 1889.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le nombre de personnes qui apprirent cette langue ne cessa
d'augmenter dans les décennies qui suivirent, au départ
principalement dans l'empire russe et dans l'Europe de l'Est, et
ensuite en Europe occidentale et aux Amériques. Elle pénétra au
Japon suite à la guerre russo-japonaise de 1904-1905. En Chine, les
premiers cours furent donnés à Shanghai en 1906 et à Canton en
1908. Dans les premières décennies, les usagers de cette langue
restèrent en contact principalement par des magazines spécialisés
et par correspondance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce n'était pas le premier à essayer de réunir les gens grâce à
la création d'une langue commune mais cela reste l'essai le plus
réussi. En effet, la naissance de cette langue est quasi
concomitante avec l'invention du volapük en Allemagne. Mais, dès le
début, elle s'est imposée face aux autres projets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En 1905, un premier congrès mondial eut lieu en France à
Boulogne-sur-Mer ; les caractéristiques de la langue furent fixées
et ses objectifs définis : elle devait être universellement
comprise et parlée par l'humanité entière, sans aucune priorité.
Depuis, des congrès mondiaux se sont tenus chaque année, sauf
durant les deux guerres mondiales. En 2005, son centenaire fut
célébré, de nouveau à Boulogne-sur-Mer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son développement fut diversement affecté par les tourments
politiques de la première moitié du XXe siècle. Les dictatures
hitlérienne et stalinienne soumirent ses militants à une forte
répression. Lors de la Guerre d'Espagne (1936-1939), la mouvance
anarchiste représentait l'essentiel des défenseurs de cette langue
; elle était aussi utilisée par des socialistes, des communistes
allergiques au stalinisme, dont George Orwell, à qui elle inspira
le novlangue, et même une partie de la droite catholique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L'UNESCO a adopté plusieurs recommandations en faveur de cette
langue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voilà ! Ici, vous devriez avoir maintenant deviné de quelle
langue il s'agit. Amusez-vous bien !&lt;/p&gt;
